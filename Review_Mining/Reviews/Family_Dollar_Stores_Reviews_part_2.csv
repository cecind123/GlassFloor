good,"Too much pressure and stress put on salaried managers to carry the load for the whole store."
good,"A typical day would have me up by 5 in the morning, and to work by 6. I would start working at that time and take a lunch at about 11:30 am. I would go back to work throwing cases and I would be done with work anywhere from 2-4 pm, just depending on the work load for that day. I learned how to use a headset and terminal to check off the things I was throwing, and I also learned how to drive an End Rider Forklift when doing certain types of pickups inside the warehouse also known as Non-Con or Non Conveyable. The culture there was pretty good, but not perfect. I never really had problems with management, so I would say it was pretty good for me at least. The hardest part of this type of job was the fact that it was very laborious meaning I would be on my feet for the whole day, I would be lifting pretty heavy boxes a lot of the time, and also climbing flights of stairs the entire day, but if you can manage that, not only will you enjoy this type of work, you'll also lose weight in the process! I weighed about 235 when I started there, and by the time I left a year later, I weighed 190. Overall, If you like a fast paced environment that will keep you on your feet and give you a challenge, this is a great fit for you!"
good,"Can be a hard job. When an Associate, local management had its issues....Now it is easier to do the job than it was when I was employed at Family Dollar."
good,Was a nice place to work upper management what make up their own rules that was not in the policies I would go from 40 hours to 20 hours I need something consistent it was nice people and I got a chance to work face-to-face with customers which is one thing that I love
good,Family dollar can be a great way to increase your knowledge and skills within the retail industry. Teaching leading methods for day to day operations of smaller scale stores. Always interested in promoting from within and pushing your abilities as an employee.
good,"I enjoyed working with this company,  they taught me about being an assistant manager and trained me very well. The pay was decent but I was hardly home with my children which is why I left the company"
good,family dollar is a fast pace job which has many different levels its a place for family to shop together in receive great customer service in to find what they looking for within a good price
good,it is ok for someone who needs a job to get by. its very easy and simple. comes with training if you don't understand or never worked in retail before. But overall is not enough for me to support myself and my kids.
good,"on a regular day i would receive several phone calls to help out problems and to help other managers , also in some days i would spend several hours to help train new team members ."
good,It's a good place to be a cashier or asst manager. They unload they own trucks.  They give a lot of hrs if people call out. You have to always be available for truck day.
good,"Our District Manager didn't always run things the way they should have been run. They always tried to make our store operate like a metropolitan location would operate but in a town of less than 1000 people, some things just didn't work."
good,I had fun working at family dollar my supervisors were decent and I worked well with them. Never yelled or embarrassed me. They were always teaching us how to manage the the store.
good,":) if you like being productive and pleasing your manager then you’ll like working at family dollar, have to be able to multi task a lot, have to work the register and complete other job duties by the end of your shift. Have to keep the store clean."
good,"Assisted in maintaining a clean, well-stocked store for customers during their shopping"
good,as an assistant manager I usually got overtime and learn more about management since I spend most of my time at work wish I really loved. Have worked for the company for 7 years and all along the several stores I had worked my coworkers and I became one team.
good,This was an okay job I didn't get paid what I wanted. But it was my first job and for it being a first job I would reccomend it to young people for sure.
good,Can be fast paced depending on the time and day but for the most part a relaxed setting type of job. Easy to learn the ropes if you have a good manager there to help.
good,"family was a great company, although, it was a very cutthroat environment I could only appreciate how I grew as an individual. I would recommend this job to anyone wishing to seek management experience"
good,Enjoy working for the company. I just hate the drive being an hour for me to go to work. I also dislike the fact that you get in trouble for working overtime. At max you're allowed to work 40 hours. If there are people willing to work 50 hours a week then I dont think it should be frowned upon especially when you're low on staffing.
good,Fun place too work if starting a new career i worked for a few months then i found a better paying job the employees welcomed me like a family had a great time.
good,"The job was never complicating , just when customers would get aggravated when there was a big line."
good,For a starter on careers is good. Long term the salary is not good specially if you have children. I feel like I was not paid fairly for my performance.
good,I liked the Job overallthe past  the only raj bad thing about it....you have your rude customers and thieves but that's to be expected in retail..otherwise it wasoj when you got overtime and pay was better
good,"Family Dollar was a good job, only problem I ever had was the manager showing favoritism and giving her “favorite employees” more hours then the rest or making certain people work more/harder than the rest. I was paid fair working there."
good,I had a great manager and great customers. Work was constant which made work day quick. Co-workers were friendly and easy to work with. Was an interesting job.
good,The job itself was easy just I felt I wasn't able to keep up with productivity and I knew it would be hard on me physically and emotionally but biggest reason for quitting was the hour driving to and from work money wise it just wasn't going to be cost efficient for me had to look for work closer to home.
good,Depending upon your managers and location. Organization is keys to getting the place ran like it should. Camera and security could be better in my opinion. For a big company these items should be universal.
good,had a good time there great place to work if u care and can take the stress. have seen lots of people that could not.i didnt agree with salary but i liked my job
good,I did my best working there I worked 8-9 hr days 30+hrs a week I was always a reliable worker I did my job in the best way I knew how I was always on time
good,Switching very fun and relax always on time switching trailers yard of yard moving trailers to the dock doors moving 48-foot trailers moving 50 foot trailers around the yard also moving pucks organizing the yard very relaxing always on time on my duties I moved about a hundred and twenty trailers a day that's what Family Dollar Distribution Center for FedEx Ground I'm over average of 80 trailers at night and after doing a 6 hour period of time
good,I have learned that all people are not the same.that u always do your job even if the situation is bad and always respect others...........................................................................
good,I enjoyed working at Family Dollar. They're were so many different aspects of the job to learn which made it challenging which I enjoy a challenge. I would have not left this job if the store did not close down.
good,"Can be an amazing experience, but honestly FD management beyond the store doesn't like to give out raises. If they would have paid me more, It would have been ideal."
good,"i don't care about this job it was horrible never got paid good money your essays and count how many words per line you write. The requirement for an essay is at least 250 words, which equals 28 lines and you should count the lines, not the words. Any letter or report should be"
good,If your going to work in a store like this it’s best to be a FT manager they get more hours and more pay then PT cashiers. The work is easy when their is actual teamwork going on.
good,"Multitasking is necessary, flexible schedule, especially if you work evening hours, able to lift over 20 pound, have to be 18 since they do sell tobacco products. Also you are able to cover other employees shifts only if you want to."
good,Learned a variety of leadership and management skills. Workplace culture was fantastic.  Typical day involved stocking shelves with product and cashier
good,"Typical day is running register, stocking shelves and customer service. "
good,I loved coming in to work. I loved interacting with the customers having wonder conversations. I stocked shelves and made sure the store was cleaned. When a customer had an a problem i tried to solve it. I did have a problem with the store manager.
good,work 60+ hours a week but because i'm salary it doesn't pay off. there is no home/work balance. would like a job with more balance. i am good at being a leader and enjoy having projects that i am responsiable for.
good,"It was a small store in a resort town,  knew customers by first names, hours were nice, shipments were like Christmas you never knew what was coming in until the truck was unloaded and boxes were opened"
good,Overall a great company to work for. All depends on the management. I have been the for 7 years now and I actually love my job. They are now bought out by Dollar Tree and not really liking the changes coming along.
good,"I worked very hard and long hours everyday for approximately 12 hours a day 5-6 days a week. I did not enjoy being a cashier, but I did enjoy unloading the truck."
good,"productive workplace, lots of customers, never boring. great prices to shop, and have abundant items in stock. Always have  stock to replenish and shelves to organize."
good,"Much confustion when it came to time off and vacation time.  More than one person on vacay at a time caused  problems when the store did not have enough coverage.  To begin I was was working 35 house a week, then it went to 40.  After about 6 months the hours decreased to about 25 a week.  All employees found themselves working part time when we were hired as full time."
good,I loved the assistant manager. They were wonderful to work for. We we're like a little family for a while but still got the work done. I would work for them anytime.
good,"Depending on what day of the week and if there is a big sale going on, it can be either slow-paced or fast paced. Schedule usually given weekly or bi weekly, all depends on the store you work in; store manager tries to take in account of what days employees want to work or have school. Hours can flip-flop, because the company itself given a certain number of hours to distribute amongst the store manager and the rest of the staff. Normally after part-timers had switched weeks with one having more hours that the other part-times and vice versa to ensure fairness. Most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help a customer find what they need and finding cool stuff to purchase for yourself."
good,"It was slow paced, comfortable and welcoming. The management was excellent, as she was willing to work around your schedule for any personal reason. The cores were easy, and the people were great as well."
good,Working at family dollar was not that bad i loved the ast. manger and the people i worked with but the store owner was hardly there and was rude most of the time
good,"I enjoyed the customer service aspect of working for Family Dollar, However there was a lot of theft that we as employees could not control. There was not enough schedule workers to properly stock the store. Which made it hard on my boss."
good,"Family dollars was a great place to work, easy and help towards work skills, manager was very hard working and put everyone on a good schedule. It's fast paste"
good,This company is a good job for students. A learning experience on how a customer is to be treated. If you like people then you will like working for this company.
good,"Sufficient employment for someone in need of extra cash, not particularly difficult but would only suggest for someone whom already has another income in the house,"
good,Family Dollar was one of the best jobs I had.  It was very relaxed and had great hours.  The more productive someone was the better chance of a raise and rewards were offered.  Coworkers were friendly.
good,"Family Dollar was a nice job to have but I never was awarded for my hard work. Some customers are so friendly and cared about their community. However, I didn’t too much like tha District Manager because of his petty ways"
good,The job requires a very attentive person willing to be fast and accurate with their job. Switching from cashier to to stocking to working aisle by aisle making sure everything its on its place and rightly priced.
good,Coworkers will be messy managers sleeping with coworkers. customer's stealing out of the store. Cash will always come up short the employee's was steal from the store.
good,It was a pleasure working with the people at this location. The main goal was to get the job done and to get it done well. Management wasn't on your back all the time. I had the opportunity to work with a mellow Store Manager.
good,"A hard place to work, the job is easy but the customers make it tough. The rate of turnover is high, theft is off the charts and everyone's ""training"" is a joke. They are trying hard to fix that now though."
good,"Great working environment"
good,At Family Dollar you were required to do everything in the store from unloading your weekly delivery truck to ordering your merchandising and sometimes closing alone.
good,It was good because I moved up quickly and it was a good work environment. As long as you're not a lazy person it should be good. It is a constantly steady flow of things to do.
good,It is not something someone should put their life into. It is a stepping stone for experience. One should not stay here too long. It is good for getting to know the locals in the area.
good,I was assistant manager here so it was a much needed experience as far as my personal growth and the community the Family Dollar was in was urban so there was never a dull moment
good,I was able to improve on my leadership/management skills at family dollar. The only bad thing is the pay doesn't seem to align with the work. They've backed out of raises at least three times in my time there
good,Great company to work for. Nice employees and very skilled manager. It is a company that I would return to work for depending on what hours I could get and the kind of money I would be making.
good,"A typical  day at work was very interesting because everyday was like an adventure, I would see some of my customers multiple times a day. I learned how to be a great leader and take control because most people at my job were ignorant,lazy and didn't have great customer service skills. The most enjoyable part of the job was coming to work honestly"
good,early mornings as well as late nights. learned how to be as cashier as well zoning all areas. Management is okay. The hardest part of the job was shipping and receiving . though the most enjoyable part of the job was getting discounts.

good,good place to work and learn new skills and meet new people. fast paced work makes the day go fast so you feel like it doesn't drag on.
good,Great environment loved ha ing regular customers come in. Fast paced but madr days go by quicker. They are very friendly and helpful with all your training
good,A typical day at work is moving merchandise around to find location that would appeal tho the customers.I learned that it takes a team of motivated individuals to make a company successful. I enjoyed assisting the customers and talking to them to get feedback  about improvements.
good,I just need more pay for all the hours I work because everybody else makes more tha6what I make and I don't think that's fair Because I been the only cashier for months until she hired another one recently
good,It was really a great opportunity to be working with family dollar but was a little raicist when it comes to skin color. Spanish people treat Africans different in the store.
good,A good company to work for just limited room for advancement. The Management at my location was great as well as how flexible they are with schedules.
good,my review of this facility they could've had better management. the company was always in the mist of violence and people robbing the store just totally out of hand and unsafe
good,had to contact corporate about a  manager changing peoples hours they worked to fit their budget and she was also stealing from the store. overall i would have stayed if i didnt have to move
good,The team was nice people and we got along great. We were all really good team members. Keeping the front stocked and always clean everything lined up so its nice for the costumers.
good,"Typical day at work, giving customer service, stocking and making sales.  The most enjoyable part of the job is  meeting many people, hardest part is the job is scheduling with limited hours. the most enjoyable"
good,A typically day at work consists of providing customers with quality service and correctly performing cashier duties. I learned how to work with co-workers and to be responsible with my time.The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with different customers daily.
good,"While I worked here, there were a lot of opportunities for overtime and the schedule was very flexible. They pay well for travelling to different stores and often reimburse you for food expenses when at other stores."
good,I enjoyed working for Family Dollar and would definitely advise other to apply. I just felt that it was not a good utilization of my skill set as well as the need to relocate within the city. I was initially excited about the job because it was a brand new location being opened and as apart of my probation period I assembled the interior of the store.
good,I worked with Family Dollar for only 2 months but the time I had working with them was fun and friendly. I really enjoy the staff and some customers when I had to quit the Manager said she would love to have me back anytime. I just wish we had more help in the front with having to stock the shelves and keep up with the register it was a bit overwhelming.
good,open store close store 6 days a week more retail expereince  enjoyed working with customers when people dont show up for work it doesnt help morale for store
good,Its a good place to work if your friendly and love to be around people. Its fast paste and can really be enjoyable if your really into the experience and take full advantage of it.
good,"Enjoyed working with the people I worked with. Always found work to do. We worked as a team, there were never any problems between employees. Great place to work."
good,"There is poor communication between management and team members. However, with a bit of work, you can typically figure out what needs to be done to get a project finished. The culture here is close knit, but the job is also demanding. Cashiers and managers alike have a decent workload to complete. However, if you put in the hours and the effort, upper management will take notice."
good,"The work place was good in the beginning when started working there, but then towards the end it became difficult to be around my co-workers. The environment after a while wasn't healthy for me to continue working there. I felt that the workers were against one another and they didn't respect one another especially management."
good,There are so many interesting new things that could be happening and so many options to explore but if you do choose to work here be sure that management is better and there was a lot of theft
good,I enjoyed my job but the hours and shifts became too much for my family and I to acomidate. The job environment was a great place to be but when holidays came around you were required to work sometimes all day by yourself with no relief . The job is physically taxing but the benefits out weighed that aspect
good,"Good Job, "
good,"I loved working at Family Dollar most of the time, it can most definitely be a challenge at times. Houston locations are difficult to handle with high turnover rates as well as terrible shrinkage. Smaller town locations are more manageable but less pay."
good,"Family Dollar was my first job so I dint know what to expect out of it but as my first job I enjoyed working there, had a great team and worked at a great store."
good,"A-Typical retail experience. Stock freight, cashier, recover clean up. Nothing special with working at Family Dollar. No benefits, no vacation for 1 year."
good,"The benifit package is great, major medical, life insurance, 401k, education reembursement and paid holidays. If you want to advance this is the place."
good,"unloaded trucks, put away stock receive orders price changes mod changes run to bank run register assistant with costumers clean remove outdated products"
good,Great opportunity to learn and grow.Fun and professional work environment caring and logical thinking management.Customers make your day. Loved ins and outs o f running my location.
good,"it was good and I very much did enjoy the management and the coworkers. I would definitely recommend a friend to apply, as I already have 2 acquaintances who have been hired."
good,"There wasn't much to the job other than stock, cashier, and sanitation. As long as you balance the three out the job was easy. The most important aspect of the job, however, is your soft skills, problem-solving and listening. Because customers will always find something to stress and complain about and although it can be frustrating to deal with, it's part of the family dollar job to listen to what they have to say."
good,"It’s was fun. The emplyees had a great sense of humor. They explained ways to work more efficiently, in which we’re helpful during my time of employment there."
good,"Enjoyed working for this company, would recommend people to work here , great customer service, reliable people you work with. Register , stocking , cleaning"
good,A very productive work place where you can meet many different people. Learn many new things in the retail business. Advance in a work place faster then most companies.
good,More hours and not being cheap will make the company better. You can not go overtime. It is so so frowned at; even though you are not taking a playful overtime.Recommend it for someone just starting out in life.
good,"I loved how working with family dollar kept,me busy. Always something to do and i loved my customers. My manager made it easy for me to enjoy my. I would work for company again."
good,Great working environment. Lots of great people to work with. Flexible Scheduling. There is not a lot more I can say about this.I will not keep going because I already said there is nothing more I can say.
good,"I loved my job. it was challenging every day. I wish that the "
good,"as a store manager i worked 55-60 hours a week , no home life. ran a team of 4 people. long hours and turnover for team members, store was open 7 days a week 12 hours a day with 2-3 people only"
good,Family Dollars you will learn a lot about management. Plus working out u-boat and pallets in the amount of time. The hardest part of my job is getting ready to close for night.
good,"Busy days, quick paced, fun. I loved my manager. Wished it was more than temporary. I worked from 3-9 pm and I met a lot of people. Enjoyed it. Would recommend to others."
good,"I think the store is very unorganized and need some help in management, there are good workers there and they all be to work on time, think they need to have over night shift to organize and stock at night mostly zone."
good,pushing fright doing reset and unloading trucks how to be a muti tasker unloading the truck just managment and one other person learning new thing as well as weekly pay
good,"Running around all day back and forth doing inventory, unloading trucks for shipment, helping stock the shelves, price tag items, mark down items for clearance , as well as cashiering at the front registers if the lines get long( they always do) best part of the job was the breaks paid for 30 minutes and half off clearance items"
good,I enjoyed working for family dollar store. My coworkers were friendly. The managers are flexible with your schedule for school and second jobs. It was a productive company
good,"Long days at work; however I enjoyed working at FD. The benefits like any other big company were good. they treated me with respect."
good,Its was a ok  job  it has been a while since i worked there. I cashiered and stocked the shelves  when i first started there i helped set up the store.
good,"this job environment is go, go, go, so if you don't like to keep busy, move around while maintaining a good attitude this is not the place for you. working with the public can be tedious at times. However, you do have some regulars that will make your day."
good,I would only recommend this place as a part-time go to school and work job... If your trying to make it day to day then this is not the place to do that thru.
good,Great experience with meeting different people. I love working with others and the atmosphere is great! Great benefits when you become a Full time employee.
good,I oversee 230 plus stores in regards to all loss prevention policies and procedures.  Including internal and external theft.  I also review and investigate daily cash shortages.
good,Being a manager with family dollar is very rewarding.  It requires a great deal of long hours until you get the right staff in order.  But overall a great company to work for.
good,"Long hours and all hard work . Good meeting new people. A lot of stocking and unloading trucks by hand alone , lack of enough payroll. The  customers are nice to meet with a smile every day."
good,Its a nice place to get started in the working system. I would not recommend  staying unless you truly love it. You may get moved around a bunch to different stores in your area. The managers and other workers were very kind.
good,awesome experience. love working with customer and staff. will work there again. pay is ok. work day is wonderful . I learned a lot about the company and products
good,"I was working as a cashier/ customer agent here, so interacting with the public was fun, but challenging at times. The hardest part of this job was when I couldn't help someone the way they would have liked me to."
good,Working for family dollar is a good way to start as a customer service associate. Friendly and clean work environment.  Do have opportune ites to grow
good,"Family Dollar was my first job and I thought it was a good place for my needs at the time. However, if you plan to go somewhere with your life, you might consider other avenues of employment."
good,I was a cashier..........also i stocked items on the shelves when the products came in the store from the truck. The job was very slow paced. And they wanted people to more then what they were paid. I also helped build the inside of the store and others
good,"·	Handle money for business purposes"
good,Pretty balance other than need more payroll for first of the month good co workers you get to know your cutomersgood at being uptodate on monthly items to get done
good,"Interesting place to work however due to the company's need to produce more with less, it can become a strenuous job. The demand some times is higher that the scheduling allowed."
good,good people to work with. customers make it fun. management is flexible with part time employees. willing to send to other locations to meet the needs of their employees
good,I meet new people and was working my way up to managment. The GM never could get more hours for payrole. And i was working but 2or maybe 3 days out of a week just being a sales associate/cashier.
good,There's no time for sitting around! Often the work load can seem overwhelming but it can be done. More than anything a well trained and capable team is the most important element.
good,"Working at Family Dollar a typical day is stocking merchandise, working the register, and or overseeing employees under you ( if you're a manger).  More than likely a days work depends on the location of the store, and severity of the customer."
good,"ring up customers, stock rotated product on the shelf, help keep store clean, display new products and markdowns. I enjoyed meet new customers, and became comfortable with our regular customers"
good,Everything about the company was a great experience i was able to learn a lot. The staff was amazing the managers where even better. I loved my time here.
good,"its work, work is work, i dont like that i have to count my own cash register at the end of every shift. the company is laid back most of the time. I like that i can do other things other than just cashiering."
good,Family Dollar is a very good company to work its adventurous they help you get ahead its a bunch of benefits they have stores everywhere there very understanding on occasions.i enjoyed my time there.

good,The job is quite up pace and steady. At first of course take some time to get use to but nothing close to impossible. Work hard and you will get the pay raises on deserves
good,It is a ok starting management job. But has no real benefits. Management was very kind and easy going. but maybe to easy going big loss prevention problem. mainly do to current employs and past employs
good,good place to work for a part time job and extra money. not something I would look to get into for a career. people at work was friendly and helpful most of the time
good,A very  nice place to work. Always meeting new people very interesting. Opening  and closing the store  is a breeze once you have been trained properly.  Few high robbery rate is my issue with this company.

good,"Didn't stay with the company long , under compensated and overworked. It's a great place to get retail experience and move into management easily. Good starter job."
good,Family dollar is a great place to work learn and grow if you have the right team. I learned different management skills that I can take to another retail store and move foward there
good,"A typical day at work was fairly simple; oversee employees, stock the store and help customers with what they need. I learned some of the basics of management as well as how to handle situations that I had not faced. My problem solving skills also progressed. The workplace culture was that of getting the job done. We all wanted to finish the work that was in front of us. The hardest part of the job was keeping people focused. At this time the store I was at had a lot of turnover, so we kept having to train new individuals and try and mold them to want to work at a fast pace."
good,Family Dollar is a great place to work. I assisted with opening as well as closing multiple stores in the Savannah Region. I have gained many relationships with employees as well as customers throughout my time being with the company.

good,"Management is terrible and has no structure."
good,"Help customers, stock shelves, count cash register draw at the end of each shift, make bank deposits, keep the store clean at all times and lock up the store before going home at night."
good,"To many people on one shift so I wasn't gettn as many hours  as I need  and this place was very jucky there For they was very unorganized company  and the mangers,wasn't experience to be in there  position"
good,It's a pretty cool job but the management needs improvement. It seems as though personal life always draws to family dollar which interrupts the work environment.

What I loved the most was the customer service aspect as I enjoy working with the public."
good,Though I enjoyed my work experience the 70 hour weeks were a down fall of the job. I was good at what I did and always gave my very best.

good,a typical day at work for me would be behind the register. i learned how to work in a fast pace because sometimes your line can build up. my managers have been ok and i really enjoyed all of my co-workers. the hardest part of the job would have to be truck day because it can really give ou a headache depending on how many customers are in the store because you wanna get that stuff in there and stocked on the shelves. the most enjoyable part of that job would be the customers. you actually get some mean customers and then you have some that are very nice to you. some offer to leave tips and then you get some kids and older people that come in that really dont know what their looking tor and you have the pleasure of helping them. you would be surprised at how thankful some peolpe are.
good,I enjoy the day to day interaction with customers.  The management is very fair and the employees are easy to get along with.
good,"Family Dollar was the first job I've ever had. It's what got me started in the ""World of Responsibilities"". I learned how to become a people person. I've developed my customer service skills at this job."
good,Store stays fairly busy and you have to do lots of multitasking.
good,"A wonderful job, but the inventory was just overwhelming. You would have more stock than it was safe to store in warehouse."
good,nothing bad just they expect too many hours out of managers and they do not give enough hours to have employees there to pay for the work to get completed in a timely manner.
good,"	Performed opening and closing procedures "
good,"A typical day at Family dollar involves working the register, stocking, dealing with customer returns and complaints, and opening or closing the store. What i have learned is to effectively manage my time and how to effectively work with co-workers. One of the things i enjoy is the relationship i have with my co-workers we are really close with one another and function almost as a family where we are all there in case anyone needs anything. The hardest part of the job is unloading truck due to the actual physical stress. What i enjoy most about this job is working with such a close group of people."
good,"it was fair and the conditions were ok my co workers were cool the management was fair but a little lazy the hardest part of the job was nothing really, i enjoyed stocking the shelves"
good,"On a daily basis, the people here are very friendly and supportive with each other.  Technically we are given the flexibility to do what we do best with our experiences."

good,"Responsibilities"
good,Assisted customers with great customer service and with advance speed.
good,I am such a great asset that the manager has already offered me an assisstant manager position!
good,Heavy workload. I deserved a raise. Usually I would restock and unload trucks. Make sure items around the store were in the correct place. The hardest part of the job was the sheer magnitude of items that needed restocking. The most enjoyable was getting my money every friday.
good,"Due to the fact that Family Dollar is a corporation, they did not really care for their employees and expected them to work too many hours without very good pay.  Employees were forced to unload trucks alone work the store alone at the same time."
good,When working in another state for Family Dollar I can honestly say that I had the best team experience I have ever had. Upper Management was fantastic. Since moving to another district within the company there are a lot of questionable practices.
good,"Helping Customers, building plan o grams checkin customers out"
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with and the management. the hardest part of the job was never knowing if they needed us for overtime until right before regular overtime.
good,"My manager was very well balanced between making work enjoyable, but still getting everything done with that day. I learnt how to unload a truck properly. The hardest part was dealing with certain unhappy customers, but unfortunately you will have that with any retail or customer service job, nothing a little patience cant handle."
good,"As far as retail goes I enjoy working for this company.  I'm a manager and the DM and RD are wonderful.  They'll do anything they can to help you succeed in this very difficult and challenging position.  Most of the ""big wigs"" have worked in retail at the store level and know how hard it really is and what you need to do to run a great store"

good,I typical day at work is usually going in in the evening to close the store. This was my first management job and I say I learned a lot. Being in charge of A store and maintaining it is very important. I have worked customer service since I been working but this is another of \customer serviced. I love this job because there are the regular customers that greet me.
good,"It was an ok job, it was really only enough to keep me living comfortably."
good,I liked working at family dollar but the management treated me very unfair.
good,"A typical day would depend if I had to open the store in the morning.

good,"Always stayed busy, area was always clean and organized. Staff was easy to work with. "
good,"I was an Assistant Manager and enjoyed my job but sometimes didn't want the burden of an Assistant Manager, but the General Manager needed an Assistant Manager so I volunteered, and a typical day was making our customers happy and if they needed help with anything we helped them. What I learned from management was there was a lot of responsibility being a manager or an assistant, and co-workers were great some wanted to work as a team and some didn't. The hardest part of the job was closing the store counting down and seperating all the money and putting certain amounts in the drawers for the next day, petty cash had to have so much and then there was also for the bank as well.

good,"Family Dollar store prides itself on being a company that helps stretch the average family's dollar. No, the company is not a dollar store, but rather a store providing name brand products at very low prices. The store was brand new and I was the very first store manager. I was responsible for up to four employees at a time and maintained responsibilities such as inventory, balancing books, maintaining excellent customer service, contacting vendors, managing payroll, random drug testing, hiring/firing, interviewing, and ensuring a fully stocked store.

good,"Family dollar was a decent paying job, weekly pay is hard to beat. The stress from everything going on around it were not good. The store is in a bad location and it becomes very relevant in the store."
good,"Pros: benefits, pay (managers), opportunity for advancement"
good,Bad in training.. Great pay for managers but poor pay for cashiers.. Not enough payroll to much on one person in a day. Limited when you can take vacation. They dont worry about your safety. I enjoyed working as I did not have to be micro managed. The hardest part was being able to keep staff hired that wanted to work.. Overrall I enjoyed what I did.
good,My experience here at family dollar has been great. It can be stressful but with a great team and great people to work with makes everything work smoothly. You have to have a lot of patients and take your time to work with each customer.
good,"My manager was a wise and considered man, it was a good experience, I learned things that I am still using as a manager, company is ok but the payment is not good enough."
good,I loved working at family Dollar I never had a problem there I did really well everything was smooth I enjoyed it that was the best job I ever had!There were a couple issues with the people working didn't want to do there jobs or slacking but we had meetings and I always picked up the slack because I take pride in my job
good,"It's was a good working experience and it taught me a lot. Including how to work under pressure, multitasking, my communications skills, and many more other things."

good,I loved the though of working with Family Dollarat first because I was told that I could advance my position but that never took place.  The pay also made it difficult to stay there.
good,The job is pretty laid back it’s just all the work you have to do for the job pay!!! I also didn’t like they changed our every week pay to biweekly!!!
good,"I really enjoyed my tenure at Family dollar until an DM that was not found of people of color took over our district. I really enjoyed working for Family dollar until then.  I left as a certified training manager after being there for 1 yr. I increased my sales, exposed theft In the district, and reduced shrink for my location by over $5k for the year."
good,"Nice company, able to move up in company from cashier to manager, must be a good team player, pretty decent job, must have good customer service skills to keep loyal customers"
good,"I absolutely loved the people I worked with they were easy to get along with and made the job worth going. I absolutely loved some of the regular customers which also made it possible to go everyday. The hours were some times to much I would sometimes work more than my store manager, I would work about 60-65 hours a week between two stores yes it was a great check but I had four children at home I didn’t see often."
good,You will work for your money. Its hot but you can make some good money if you try hard enough l. It is a very physical job will keep you in shape. Work out for free
good,Its an ok place to work especially as a teenager looking for a  summer job. Or partime job after school its a steady place of business. Its an easy job to do
good,I feel like I’m not getting paid enough for the assistant manager position. The company doesn’t give you no benefits which I believe that it’s actually not fair at all
good,You are over worked and managers work overtime and are only paid for 52 hours only. When your members don’t come in your stuck working their shifts. At night you have to be careful to make sure you don’t get robbed .
good,Working at family dollars was good I have no problems while working in the company. I was a team player but I could work alone and I made it to work every single day.
good,One of my favorite jobs. I actually asked my manager to not hire another assistant full time and give me the hours. Was going to try to become store manager but didn't end up doing that
good,Its very great place to work especially if your looking for a start up job family dollar can help you build your skills and help you move up in the company
good,I like working at family dollar.. its just stressful sometimes not having all the hours that are needed for a woman and 5 kids. I need something more. i really want to work from home.
good,"Boss is great! People are fun to be around,  was hole in the wall, and finally being brought back to standards... I've worked at a whole lot of places that have paid better and been a hostile workplace that no-one wants to work in.."
good,It's a alright place to work at. Sometimes it get's messy and lack of workers. Needs more security to stop customers from stealing but other then that it's a decent place to work at.
good,I enjoyed my time here. It is a lot of work for what they pay. Management spends a lot of time alone in the store which I don't think is safe. Part time does not get very many hours.
good,I enjoyed working for Family Dollar. My store had a family oriented feeling to it. My staff and customers were like family which made a great environment to work in.
good,My experience at Family Dollar was really good. Loved the people and the job. My manager wasn't the best. District manager was on point. Not every family dollar is the same!
good,The Management was very friendly and helpful. I would recommend anyone to work for Family Dollar. Team members was friendly and helpful as well. Down to earth people.
good,"Family Dollar seems to be a good place to work.I have only been employed for 7 months and I intend the job to be temporary as I am looking for a position within the Telecom/Data Center field. But, overall, the work environment is good and my co-workers are nice."
good,"Helped me develop my customer service based on dealing with customers on a daily basis , worked with a incredible team of individuals which we had a great chemistry together"
good,I enjoyed my stint at Family Dollar. I worked as a new store setup personnel . Each day was interesting because I was able to get a different job experience each day . Management made sure we had proper training  and worked along side to make sure the job was done correctly. The atmosphere was light but professional. The team worked hard but had fun while doing it . It was a short term position so my only problem is that I wish it lasted longer and wasn't temporary.
good,Working at family dollar taught me to be less shy and more interactive with people. I also learned to keep myself busy when customer volume slows down & to stay focused when the store got busy.
good,I enjoyed working at family dollar. I enjoyed working with the people there and learned a lot while working there. Great pay and a good flexible schedule.
good,It was nice place to work just was annoying being the only one to work there . So it’s jusr one of those things where you bring it to attention but nothing is done
good,I loved this job. Upper management could not understand not all work was possible to complete. The teamwork was provided by the other workers. Some were just plain lazy.
good,"It was fun and interesting; customers are nice and friendly. They understood when you had a line, and worked with you. Hours were flexible. We made coffee in the back."
good,It was a very decent job. Just wasn’t for me. Very slow and boring. Didn’t really learn anything much here other than what I already knew and had gained from another job.
good,"In the role as Assistant Manager the people must to do in all areas of Family Dollar, but the people don't receive more incentives or salary for this position"
good,The position that I had was not so bad because I did not have to be on the register too often. I had a lot of freedom to choose what I wanted to work on for the day. Managers aren't the greatest though.
good,"My experience with the company really opened my eyes to the things available from the company, i was promoted pretty quickly but i learned a lot. It was a great job."
good,As far as retail jobs go this one was by far the most fun.  I had great co-workers who made the day go by fast.  Some of the facing of the store was ridiculous because it never stayed like that.
good,"Been there many years, has been a great place to work last several years, recently taken a down turn with buy out and office relocation"
good,"I enjoyed the work environment,  it let me improve my people skills.  I wasn't thrilled about the managers playing favorites with other employees or the fact that they didn't follow the rules and would have me run the store all day by myself till it was close to closing time.."
good,"This job is great if you are fast-paced and can handle many things at once. You will need to be able to stock, organize, and change around merchandise all while keeping an eye out on the counter for customers. You also need to be able to lift 25 pounds or heavier."
good,great time meeting and coexisting wit each of my co workers. Flexible schedule makes it easier for those who attend school. Management was helpful and personable.
good,I enjoyed working here. I liked that you could receive an annual bonus as well as weekly performance incentives. What I enjoyed most about the job was being able to train new-hires to be as great as I was.
good,"Family dollar is a good place to work if you like to be customer orientated,  if you work hard and show up to work you can move up quickly , there not very flexible with hours you must be able yo have full avaliablitly !"
good,Every day was something different to do. I enjoyed that you got to stay busy. Enjoyed working with the customers and being able to get to know them better. Enjoyed unloading truck and doing stock
good,Followed all management duties.The job its self was relaxing. always finished assigned tasks on time and helped other teammates when they where in need.
good,Decent job overall great to interact with customers face-to-face and help them with any thing they need in the store managers are polite and help you with anything that you need as long as you do your job
good,Position are comfortable and easy learning. Most positions do not have as many work meetings. This allows employees to concentrate on managing their jobs.
good,Better as career for salary manager in terms for pay. This is a very competitive retailer and they require much but don't get half as many qualified candidates to assist with job.
good,It's a job with it's advancment..  pay is not so good .  To you must have patience to work here. But they want u to dedicate your time to them last. Good luck
good,It was a nice place to work at the manager was very nice and understandable. I will recomanded this place to anybody that is looking to get paid weekly or just wants a part time job.
good,"Good place if there wasn’t so much drama from one person , the work is hard but to know all your customers makes things great planning big sales event and turning it into a big hit is great , I’m just ready to move on"
good,I didnt like working here because of the enviornment. Staff was handling situations poorly. I didnt have enough time in my breaks. And the security was bad.
good,"A typical day at family was at noontime it gets rough and the crazy people come in with alot of drama. Also, by working there i pick up some good habits like for example, holding my coworkers accountable for what they was or wasn't doing  at that time."
good,Family Dollar was an easy job for me. The only thing is you have to remain in shape because the managers are the main ones unloading the truck. So if you can’t life 50 plus pounds consistently the you’re going to strugglr
good,"Non stop work to do at Family Dollar, Not a bad company to work for if you enjoy fast paced, customer oriented tasks. Great customer's that are loyal to your location"
good,One thing I liked about working there is the seasonal coupons we would get as employees. I highly recommend Family Dollar as a great job to apply to..
good,Good place to work for individuals in school to further their education. I never had any bad encounters with customers while working for the company .
good,I loved working at family dollar my managers was the best. They always was on the floor helping out they didn't let their title make them. The staff was cool. But for the work and the craziness that you had to deal with on a daily basis they could have paid more. Would I go back and work for this company yes if they up their pay..
good,The  district manager came in and made the stores i his district horrible. People quit which left store managers in there store all day long with 15-20 hours overtime with no extra pay.
good,Family Dollar is a great company for those trying to find work within the retail field to build your experience working with everyday people. The hardest part of the job is unloading the truck and finding where everything goes. While the easiest would be cashiering and answering people's questions.
good,"Open or close the store, unload truks, stoke shelves with inventory from the truck , zone the shelves before closing so store is neat and clean for the opening shift. Count the safe in the morning or at close also do the deposit and do bank runs. Train new employees do voids and refunds. Assist the manager with store displays and paperwork."
good,This job is worth the trouble if you put the right amount of work in. its a little unstable in the beginning but once you show your hard work it will pay off in the long run. Most stores struggle to keep people because nobody wants to do the work.. but it will pay off i promise. you can move up into management in no time if you show you're willing to learn and work hard to keep the responsibility. store managers get salary plus yearly bonuses.
good,"a typical day was stocking the shelves, customer service, and working the cash register, and cleaning the store at closing. the hardest part of this was working the cash register alone during the busy hours. the most enjoyable part of this job was making new friends."
good,My job at family dollar was decent. I had to stock merchandise and ring up customers. I didn't like having to go in super early on truck days but that's only because Im not a morning person. The management was nice and the pay was decent.
good,Typical day is stressful hard work I've learned to listen to customers how to Forfill there satisfaction hardest part of the job is scheduling wand call outs most enjoyable when your drink is down
good,"Overall Family Dollar is a pretty nice job . I learned mostly how to stock during my time at Family Dollar . But when I first started working there management was terrible until they hired someone new . When I'm at work most customers are happy and feeling good about themselves , but there's always the odd bunch whose day isn't going too swell . I can honestly say unloading the truck was the hardest part of the job . Finally I just enjoyed the work experience ,being able to learn new things , and being able to make customers smile ."
good,Everyone works as a team to get everything accomplished. It is a fast paced place to work. The company is good to take care of their employees if they must work elsewhere or go to a meeting. Very easy job.
good,"I have worked at Family Dollar since January 2018, it was been the most interesting job that I have had so far. The management is good, could be better on some days, but we work with what we have. I like this job, but it is only temporary. It is a good place to work if you have managers that would work with your schedule like the ones at my store do."
good,"Did not work there very long, but I remember it being very relaxed and slow-paced. Duties were simple and straight-forward. Overall, it was an easy job and would make a good first job."
good,I had learn a lot of position inside the warehouse . It’s a very easy job to learn. The hardest part of the job is . When you trying to make products in a very hot warehouse.
good,Friendly environment get to know people. Learning different products within the store. Learning what your customers like on a day-to-day basis. Interacting with people. Building great customer service.
good,As you know family dollar is a great place to find thousands of items in one store at a decent price. problem is lots of these locations are in undesirable locations. this makes the risk of theft mischief and robbery very high
good,"I learned how to be patient with customers. I never worked retail before, however, It can be a very challenging environment. Dealing with the customers was the hardest part and the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"It’s a good job for most people. They are stable and strict they demand cleanliness and neatness. They are fair at times, and want the best for the store."
good,"long hours, a lot of hard work, but overall a good place to work.The upper management is not at all worried about store managers, it is impossible to reach someone to speak with about anything."
good,This was a very quick paced job requiring teamwork. It was kind of stressful when quarters and sales wasn't being met. It was also stressful when employees called in or wouldn't show up for work.
good,Family Dollar is okay company to work for. They pay less money for the job that required. They only care about making money and there store managers then their other employees.
good,"I left Family Dollar because they promised to transfer me to a store that would have been closer to my home. They did not do that once I set up the transfer, no opening at the store for which I was going to transfer to. I did not like that the fact that they did not hold up to their agreement and found employment elsewhere that was more flexible and paid better. Otherwise the store I worked at was friendly, fun, and flexible with my schedule."
good,You can work your way from the bottom to the top real fast. It is easy to learn the ins  and outs. The only thing you have to worry about  is the thief.
good,Count register stock shelves and clean  help customers   but  when the manager says they do all the work and you don't do any thing and you bust your butt everyday and come in when they ask. But you call out for a medical reason they  say  well you  can work  because  I do. that is poor managment
good,Great place to work for the most part. They have great benefits however pay in not great but not bad. Hours suck if you have a family or want a home life.
good,A typical day at Family Dollar included assisting and helping with customers to ensure great satisfaction. I learned great communication skills. The management staff was very professional and did their best to ensure employees were treated fairly and were satisfied. The workplace environment was laid back and stress free and easy. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with theft from customers but with the proper methods; handling a situation as that could go pretty smooth. The most enjoyable part of the job would be seeing customer satisfaction. Making sure the customer is happy is really the most important thing to me.
good,"I did enjoy working here, though things such as scheduling and such could have used alot of improvement to make the daily experience even better. It can be a fast paced job depending on where you live."
good,Came into work with a positive attitude but usually by the end of the day I was feeling overwhelmed and aggravated.Taking the stress and overworked backed up workload home making it a full time job. I did my best to stock the store and watch the register when the store still needed to be stocked and re-organized due to the day. There was only 2 employees running the entire store with no backup or preparation the entire time I was an employee of Family Dollar.
good,"A typical day at work would be ringing up merchandise from the store and directing people towards items they need. They also do a lot of upselling. When it's slow in the store or you don't have customers we clean, stock, and recover merchandise. It's a lot for the little pay we got. It's easy to move up though if you are dedicated. The most enjoyable part is your coworkers, they make the job more fun. The workplace culture is not as happy as it should be, because they want us to do so much for little pay. Customers can also be a pain."
good,Its a very fast paced environment. You can learn a lot if you pay attention. Lots of knowledgeable people within the company. Not much room for advancement once you get in unless you know someone. Overall a good place to work. They are not very family oriented as past employers have been.
good,"This company does not pay its management teams enough for all they do. A typical day involves paperwork, cash handling, customer service, as well as putting up stock, merchandising, and setting up displays. I learned to work as a team because one person can not thrive on their own in this environment. The hardest part of the job was unloading the truck, which is a another responsibility of management. The most enjoyable part of the job was working through Christmas and helping customers find just what they needed for their families."
good,I enjoyed the customers and that is the most enjoyable part of the job. The upper management is something that is very lacking in the employee/employer relations. They need to have a better management.
good,"In family dollar is where I learned most of what I can do today. I am thankful that I was able to operate as a manger and put into play all of the skills that I was educated upon. The most enjoyable part of this job was the customers and the unpacking, as well as managing payroll and systems affairs."
good,"My manager was very kind and accommodating to her employees."
good,"its an okay job, for  a high school/ college student, but it does get stressful. being a cashier isn't hard, but the customers make it hard. you'll have to have a lot of patience."
good,Great place for those who can multitask and get job done fast. Multiple opportunities to move up in the company. Patience with customers who become difficult.
good,I enjoy working for Family Dollar.  The other employees as well as the customers are what make it that way.  It can be hectic and stressful but at the end of the day the people I work with make up for it.
good,"Very quicker paced with getting customers in and out, also there is never nothing to do inside family dollar. There’s always something to be stocked or recovery to be done"
good,"The management was amazing, along with the ability to work around my schedule. I had a school schedule and was able to work as well. The day is fast paced, and busy along with tasks that truly keep the store running."
good,I learned how to use the register very well. I actually liked working on the register. Somedays it was very fast pace working but it wouldn’t be so hard if you have help depending who you are working with on the shift.
good,"With my years at Family Dollar, I did many different jobs and was able to advance as quickly as i could.  I enjoyed working with most of the people there"
good,"I enjoyed my time with Family Dollar, even though I left there. I liked the job that was the first job I got hired on from coming out of the military. I went from a part time cashier to a part time assistant manager in a few months. My only issue was the manager she was a little aggressive and rude. I would love to work there again, but the manager and I left on bad terms."
good,"At this job I got hired as an Assistant Manager very quickly. This customer service job was more then a hassle, bad management, everyone isn't friendly and the customer get harder by the day."
good,"I worked there during college, and so for me at the time it was great. The hours were sometimes awkward to fit around my school schedule, but my manager was very understanding that my schooling came first. I also was able to be promoted within y first year of working there, and since I had no previous experience with being in management, the store manager really helped me out so I could excel."
good,Work is not hard but there are times when you many tasks are the required. Very low payroll for part timers. Managers get burn out due to being salary employees.
good,"Family Dollar is a very fast pace production environment requiring attendance, patience and overtime. Over the 17 years at Family Dollar, I learned several important values from different managers and team members.The hardest part of the job is the long hours and having to be gone from home. I truly enjoyed my time with Family Dollar. I met several people over the years and respected and valued our friendships."
good,"Hearing the word, ""No"" so many times/in so many ways.....the rejection letters/emails/no response. The best part is that it only takes one ""YES!"""
good,The customers are cool and funny and being able to bring customers back after a bad experience feels good. Management depends on you to do your job and theirs at times.
good,i worked there for many years. I enjoyed the people i worked with and all of my customer the only down side was the people in corporate which was the issue for most people that worked for the company.
good,I loved my job at family dollar.. It was just too demanding.. 60hrs a week. One day off. Dollar tree bought out FD and for the last year have been changing so many things.
good,"Working here felt like you were part of the family. Colleagues were very friendly and compassionate. A typical day included welcoming customers as they entered and helping them as they shopped, when necessary."
good,"Good job, that you would enjoy. The work/life balance is great, This is a great job opportunity for those who enjoy moving around and assisting customers face to face. The management is very understanding."
good,The environment was good. The performance was great. The management they took you for granted.  Not enough pay for what you worked for. They let the manager's and assistant's work for several hours by themselves without security.  They would promise things to their employees and did not keep their word. The pay was good but not that good because you can work 45 hours a week and get less than what you would get for 35 hours a week.
good,My review is average Abt this job.its okay as an odd job.but they should increase the payment wages.they also include benefits for the employees.they should improve the customer care service also.
good,Family Dollar is a Cool place to work if you get the opportunity to set up a store from the beginning it's wonderful to be able to see it all the hard work come together from start to finish
good,"Family dollar was my favorite place to work, i loved helping the customers, i loved working with the people i did, i loved stocking shelves, and unloading the truck. it is very laid back, and the truck drivers are always super friendly!"
good,Family Dollar is were I started my retail experience. Its the conpany that help me find what I wanted to do in life. I learned so much about retail through this company.
good,This is a great job for people who like to move around and also to assist others. I enjoyed the environment it was very mellow and easy to get into a rhythm.
good,working for family dollar was and could be fun but get the job done. could use better benefits and better pay but the workplace was great and management was awesome
good,"The opportunity for advancement is there if you are willing to put n the effort.  Most managers are salary, and therefore, you are there if no one else can be.  To make the store work and run properly, depending on the sales volume, it may require you to work 60-70 hours a week or more.  YOU will make the difference.  Do not expect a large amount of outside help."
good,Overall the store is pretty good but there are something that they can do better like security Management and helping the employees out because sometime the store gets busy and is only so much one person can do.
good,You can't complain bout a job it's a job and it helps pay the bills and put food on the table it's hard getting a job out here. The job isn't hard either some of the customers that come in the store have a very nasty attitude and try to take it out on you but just ignore it and you'll be fine.
good,I worked more than 50 hours a week. I did not  have enough staff so I was at the store alone many days. They had a small budget. After working many hours I had a hard time getting off time because of the shortage of personnel.
good,"assistant managers should get paid more. You get to know your regular customers well, not too stressful of a work atmosphere. Rotating days off, pto given"
good,I've learned from family dollar. The position of an assistant manager have taught me a lot. The hardest part on the job was counting at night When I first started. The overall part of the job is that everyone worked as a team and got the job done.
good,Good work environment and easy to grow customer service skills. Weekly pay made it more enjoyable and the workload is only hard if you make it hard. It can be easy if you do your job in a fast pace.
good,"My manager needs to be better at customer service, She is rude and hateful. It is an overall great place to work, If you work with the right people. You learn how to run the register, stock shelfs."
good,"At Family Dollar some days are good and some days are bad.  The customers are great and the management is fair.  The hard part about Family Dollar is the Job Security. The customers helps me get through  the day with a smile. I learned a lot about customer  service,  how to multitask,  how to take control,  and how to strive to be great at whatever it is I do. I have great employees which makes the workplace a great company to work for and a great place for the customers to shop."
good,"As long as you have co workers that will treat you friendly, your time spent here will be well worth. Being a cashier and stocker will lead your day to fly by in a flash."
good,"I moved up quickly in the IT department unfortunately as a result I got laid off."
good,family dollar overall was an okay job in the beginning. I worked a lot of hours my boss was very depended on me. I enjoyed my everyday customers. I liked my employees
good,love my customer service job i am a people person and i love my job working around people and helping them get what they need and listening to there concerns and helping them where ever they need to be helped
good,Working for Family was a good experience for me. I learned how to manage the company well. some of the training process could be better and operations needs some improvement.
good,"This position was okay, for the most part. The pay could have been increased, though, as well as the amount of employees who worked here. There was a lot of work that fell on the employees who did work here."
good,it was a nice place to work. People were always willing to collaborate and help each other with tasks.  Customers loved the place and the people that worked there.
good,It was very rewarding. Wonderful place to work while in high school. However does not pay a survivable wage for an adult on thier own. Great as a second job.
good,It has a reasonable work schedule the staff at this family dollar was great. The management could have been better at managing the store inventory was horrible. Also staff members would bring personal problems to work.
good,"regular job  with a lot of stress involve but overall great customer service"
good,A typical day at Road house was fun because I had great co-workers and managers. Someday I did not make much because business was slow so i had to work a double to make a little money.
good,Worked at Family Dollar for over a year. Had a great SM. Was flexible & understanding. Grew a close relationship with all my fellow coworkers. After a few months I knew the entire store.
good,"At Family Dollar, one is expected to keep the store looking nice throughout the entire day. You are to greet customers with a smile and help any who may need it. After working there for a few months, I learned how to identify between the differences in name-brand and store-brand stock, what chemicals are best for cleaning up spills and other messes, and how to make people feel comfortable when shopping in a new area. The hardest part was dealing with the rude and indignant folk. The easiest part was putting out the stock from the weekly trucks."
good,Fast paced work environment. Receiving truck deliveries and vendor deliveries. Absolutely loved my coworkers and regular customers. Fun work environment.
good,"A typical day keeps you busy. This was my first job and I learned a lot about workplace relationships and how to interact with customers. The hardest part of the job is probably working in the heat and having to unload truck, the store is usually kept very warm. The most enjoyable art of the job is making friends with the regulars and seeing them come in the store every day."
good,Family dollars was a great and safe place to work. I would recommend them to friends and family. The worker that work there was very friendly as well.
good,As long as under the right management it's a great places to work and create a great environment for the customers. Good prices which creates happy customers which makes a positive vibe.
good,Nice co workers. Good starting pay but when my hours were cut short i had to leave. The reason my hours were cut short was because the store wasn't making much money.
good,"I love working for Family Dollar. You get to meet all kinds of people. "
good,Had a good year working at family dollar needed something more . Pay is good but they do not offer insurance unless you are considered full time . Which was a down fall as I have two kids also . Other wise a pretty decent place to work
good,dont like to promote from within. was good place to work at went through 2 different managers while there. and numerous assistances. not to much more i can say
good,"Start the day by getting to work an hour before the shift started. Planned the day according to the work load. Had my pre-shift meeting with the Operations manager, then proceeded to the department meeting to hand out work assignments while setting goals for the shift. "
good,I really liked this job I just didn't agree with having to work 6 days a week 52hrs and only got paid for i believe it was 45hrs salary.. They need security because too much theft was going on
good,"I enjoyed my job at Family Dollar. It is a nice place to work. Unfortunately, at the location I worked at, higher management was disrespectful,  rude, and completely selfish. I left this job due to how my manager treated myself and other coworkers."
good,I have learned a lot working at Family Dollar. I started as an assistant manager without experience and grew. I would say a typical day at work would be much movement.
good,"I liked working for them but there was not any room for advancement and hours were not  what I wanted at the time of employment, it was not a good fit for myself"
good,"It's a good place to work, but they over work you. They will make you work harder than you suppose to. Most people quit within a week. If you a hard working individual you will do just fine."
good,"A typical work day mostly consists of dealing with customers. I have learned a lot more people skills and problem solving skills because of this. The management is good, although I do not feel as if there is any opportunity to grow. I think the hardest part about the job would be the current scheduling, which is not the best. I'm wanting something that is more full-time. The most enjoyable part is that it is a laid back environment. I don't feel an overwhelming pressure from others. The management is understanding that we are people who have lives and are individual people who all work differently."
good,"The company was good to work for, sometimes expecting a lot out of you, but that is understandable. They operate on the minimum amount of people possible, which can be a bit overwhelming at times."
good,I worked hard and many hours and I really enjoyed my customers and I missed it but the store closed at my location and the customers were upset about it. I think if they would of did more for the store it would of been able to stay open
good,"The most enjoyable part about this job is, all you have to do is stock and stay to yourself. The faster you work and the neater your work is the quicker you can move on to something else."
good,Great place to work and other leaders always willing to help each other. Staffing can be challenging both leaders and team members.
good,"Family dollar in coventry rhode island isn't a bad place to work for. Most of my co-workers were very hard working, happy going people. It's always clean and the entire store is always stocked and looking full."
good,"Working at Family Dollar afforded me with meeting a variety of people on a daily basis, It was great fun. I would work here again if I was offered the chance."
good,"Although I was blessed with a Job, I feel as if they pay too little, and ask you to do too much. Not only did I have to assist the Store Manager with whatever it was that was needed, I also had to unload, stock, cashier, and do other things amongst the store and other store employees."
good,"I enjoyed the work day because it was not monotonous, and management was good. I didn't however enjoy being promised 40 hours a week and getting no where near that amount."
good,"I was always given a task to do, which is what I expect. I enjoyed working the truck because it helped me further understand different aspects of the sales floor. I was well trained on the cash register, and it was always enjoyable to learn how to apply different coupons."
good,This job in itself is a good work place as far as the business.  The environment however is a bit stressful.  The hours are stretched thin and the shifts are as well.  I often work without adequate staff and no security.
good,"Can be a fun and rewarding job if you are well prepared for what the job entails. The team below, above and around you will make all the difference as well."
good,"I opened my store and emails daily, I ran the cash register and conducted good customer service. I did schematics and put freight away as needed. I enjoyed seeing our regular customers daily. I least enjoyed dealing with an unsatisfied customer for we worked hard to avoid this. I had a great team and enjoyed working with them."
good,"Honestly , I loved family dollar , aside from the hours you spend on your feet ( God forbid you have o/t) I feel like their should've been a better accommodation for these things as some employees are bigger , and the stress could cause serious issues . But I loved the discounted snacks and food. And it was a fun and loving environment"
good,A typical day at work. You meet new people and old. Always an honor to help a customer. Hardest part was to make an angry customer happy. Enjoyed every part of it.
good,on a typical day its busy as can be to much to do and not enough time or man power but somehow manage to get it done although fun atmosphere needs some help in the employee relations dept. needs a little work
good,"I really enjoyed this position interacting will all kinds of people as a lead cashier . I was responsible for customer service , retail sales, loss prevention stocking and inventory."
good,"Family dollar wasn't a bad hire , they started me quickly and the one here is small so there was much to do . One truck basically filled the back room so there was no storing . Everything had to go on the shelves ."
good,"Typical retail. You would greet customers as they walk in, point they in the correct direction if they ask, scan and bag their items.................."
good,I had a awesome manager who worked around my school hours and family life (if my daughter would get sick she was very understanding). The customers where a awesome group of people most where local though. The only concern I had was safety in the store if we where to get robbed.
good,Great company to work for the people were awesome. Moved up from cashier to assistant to store manager. My store manager at the time very friendly. Treated you as a person and not a number. Co workers were a lot of fun to be around. Making the day great was the whole store team. Hardest part of the job was trying to get help from the district store manager when we had no one to work. Took forever to get back to you. Could be different now I have no idea.
good,I liked working at family dollar. Wish they had better pay and more hours. Other then that i enjoyed working at family dollar.
good,Job was only a temp job moving and stocking and building shelves for a new store. It was a great job the other employer's were great to work with I enjoyed the little time i was there
good,Fast-paced work. Communication and customer service skills. Busy franchise. Manager trained. Awesome team members. Small pay. Very irregular hours. Poor management.
good,"managing 2 different jobs which is cashier, stocking, schematics, cleaning store closing and opening store. "
good,"Family Dollar is a company that you can grow your experience in retail, if you seek advancement this is one of the place to go. They also offer great benefits for their employees."
good,"good job"
good,"This is a great place to work, the staff are all very friendly. The training is fast and easy and the management team are a great help."
good,"Was a fun place to work at. Meet some good people and I got to learn a lot of the regulars. Typical day involved stocking, facing, and running cashier. Management was good and some of the coworkers as well."
good,"Family Dollare is a good work place , very comfortable and easy going job . Great and very understanding custumers. Good co workers very united team and hard working. Hardest part of the job will be working 6-8 hours with not very much of a break to rest or eat. The most enjoyable part of the job would be working with the custumers i enjoy meeting new people."
good,"Everyday is multitasking day,My day consist working a register, cleaning ,recovering the store, customer service,and stocking. I've learned to move fast and still providing a well stocked, clean and friendly environment for customer to shop. The mangers always provided great direction and a fair working environment. The hardest part of the job is constantly having to redo recovery to keep the store looking great! The most enjoyable part of  the job is getting to know the customers that shopped at the store regularly . ."
good,"Making sure that the Safe/Registers are accurate. Maintain funds in cashiers registers for customers, Periodic cash pick--ups and safe drops. Build end caps with featured products, Stock shelves as well as do a detailed recovery of aisles. Drop off and pick up cash deposits and deposit slips, I'm learning how to convert shelves for upcoming seasons, My co-workers are fun and communicate with one another well, The hardest part of my job is being aware of the customers who steal products and make a scene or be aggressive with you. The customers are the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,The environment was friendly and the pay was great. I loved being there for the people that I met every day. I rarely had time for myself... I would be there from open to close sometimes.
good,"FD is a great place to work, but there is room for much improvement where work and home life comes in... a lack of paying attention to employees and their needs"
good,"I enjoy working at family dollar because i gave me the time i needed to complete my schooling. I have decent hours and i get a couple of weekends off. Management was fair, treating everyone fair. I've had previous customer service experience, but stocking was something i learned at family dollar.

Management is always available to help with any question and problems in the work place.

I did enjoy meeting new people and I made a few regulars in my time there it was a nice experienced overall"
good,Traveled a good bit with them opening or renovating stores. Also was asked to troubleshoot problem stores that needed assistance in cleanup or organizational problems. They required a lot out of individuals for a small salary and the spot check and random security and lie detector test were unnerving. Otherwise a good company to work for.

All jobs have their good and bad but at the end of the day its what you make it. Multiple locations so is usually a store near you and probably hiring. Being able to lift heavy objects is required with this job.
good,Its nice to work there.Meet a lot of new people.Learned different skills.Hours were flex. The boss was okay. but my co workers was realy nice to work with. Productive fun place to work.
good,"Family dollar was good to work for.  My issue was that I was a Store Manager of a store in a small town therefore the revenue flow didn't allow much labor cost.  With small labor cost the manager had to work many days by himself to maintain the labor percentage set by corporate.  Its hard to put out stock perform shelf resets, inventory control, run the register and control loss prevention when there was only one person doing it all at most of the time."
good,i really enjoyed working for the company but i don't think the company worked for me.if i was asked to come back i think i would. i think that some of the store managers my need to go to some type of training class.
good,"Even though there was some stuff that occurred from time to time,  but my overall time at the store I worked at was fun. From the co-workers I had to the customers I met on my shifts. So, in conclusion, I had a good time working at the store I was hired at."
good,"It is a good place to work with awesome customers. I have learned many things about being a manager in retail, especially about customer service and monies."
good,It’s a face pace job you have to have the truck put up in 48 hrs set schematics and do a lot of merchandising it’s not a bad job but plan on spending more time in your store than at home if your a store manager and if your just a CSR you might not get a lot of hrs
good,"A typical day of work was arriving promptly at 6:00 a.m. and then receiving directions from management or the district manager. I was hired to assist in the renovation of the store while also helping customers with questions. Management was very fair, taking into account my schooling schedule during finals week. The most enjoyable part of the job was not only my fellow coworkers but the satisfaction at seeing my hard work pay off in the renovation of the store's appearance."
good,Working for family dollar you must manage your time wisely because there is always a lot to do there. If you can stand for long periods of time that’s a plus. If your people friendly and can adapt to your surroundings without becoming exactly like your environment you will thrive.
good,"For the most part, you are able to work a flexible schedule.  It truly depends on the business need and the date of the week."
good,I used to love working for this company. But ever since Dollar Tree took over a few years ago things have gone downhill with all the changes in budget-cutting.
good,Store managers are independent to make their own schedule and hire employees based on their need for the store. Maintaining inventory levels and keeping a tidy store attract a plethora of consistent return customers.
good,"Always busy and productive and so enjoyable to work with the people I work with. My manager is amazing, understanding, easy to talk to and so compassionate toward all her employees."
good,Management was great great team. Just Hard work for less pay. Not worth the work for the lil pay. They don't have a lot of hours to work employees. But they do want you to be on stand by when they short of help. And you can float to Another store to get Hours. When you're store don't have hours. It's not worth the money they want to pay you with no benefits
good,How to manage a store alone and work as a team and give other employees good advice on moving on up in working at family Dollar learned team work time off when you ask for it company discount and paid time off never an issues about days or being sick
good,"Family Dollar jobs are not bad at all. it helped me improved my skills to be on time, work faster , communicate more and stayed organized. The most enjoyable part about working at family dollar is that your free to be in control of how well you manage your position just to prove yourself that you could be more than just a cashier, door greeter or stoker. The hardest thing to do is to keep at a steady pace because your doing more than just cashiering. You are cleaning, your greeting customers every time the bell ring at the door, you are stocking shelves for customers to by more product, answering difficult questions that customers have in mind to the best of your knowledge, also running the cashier and keeping track of what goes in and out of your cash draw. A typical day at work is you come in an clock in to begin your shift. Task will be wrote down on a note pad for each person to do and handle and its you r job to complete you job duties within a time frame. Stock, greet, clean up behind yourself, and run the cash register properly until lock up. Count your cash drawers at the end of the shift to make sure money NEVER COMES UP SHORT. Clean up store by mopping , wipe windows, counter tops, pull items on shelf to the edge on every ile, and lock up after setting the alarm. Management positions always have it hard. If anything goes wrong with the store they are held responsible. There is no room for mistakes if there is you have to be able to fix the situation."
good,"It was a nice job , I just had to move .I suggest this job to any male that’s coming out of high school that needs a Summer job .The job was well fair great !"
good,"No hay el soporte de los gerentes de distrito, uno puede trabajar con las herramientas adecuadas pero si uno las solicita nunca pueden resolver. Hay tiendas que necesitan especial atención por tener ambientes que necesitan repararse y uno espera por años la solución de los casos. Amo trabajar pero ellos cierran muchas veces las puertas.  Los manager tienen que trabajar 100 horas a la semana cuando el acuerdo es de 52 horas por semana."
good,Needs security and you have bad days when customers can't get what they want.Have to watch out for theives all the time. It's nice to know the customers and overall nice place to work.
good,"Overall good job for college students or someone looking for a part time job. Flexible schedule, low compensation, various changes in management. A store manager doesn’t generally stay more than a year."
good,"I Think It’s A Okay Place To Work Not  To Much Actions So It’s Mainly Peaceful , You Meet All Kinds Of Different People Which I Think Is Pretty Cool & I Wouldn’t  Say It’s A Tiring Job."
good,the team at Family Dollar was a  good team it all depends on what store you were in some the managers work good with their team members and some of the managers made it hard for the team members
good,Great coworkers. Love the hours  prepare I'm ready to work. Customers love family Dollar met a lot of new people my experiences a security I can take that you're a new job.
good,"Working as a temp for Family Dollar was a good honest job that was very straightforward and easy to settle into. I wished the job had lasted for a longer period, but it was good work while it did last."
good,Good job place  lots of good ppl hard to work 3 job at one overall very good place.did people come in learn new thing every day  one thing I learned from that place trust no one
good,I would start my day checking the isles for any misplaced items. Afterward I would clean the floor with an push broom so that the customers would have a clean floor to walk on. I learned organization skills I could use for later employment and better communication skills with employees and employers that is helpful for future employment . I enjoyed helping the customers locate items in the store and memorizing each department.
good,"As an assistant manager, day to day can be fast paced in the holiday season, to slow and a drag during slower months. Have had issues with managers but continue to work well regardless. Opportunity for promotions if you show you are capable."
good,most days was good. get to talk to costumers daily and lots of work to be done stocking and cleaning that makes your day fast. it is a place to learn from. it wasnt to hard to working feel. it was enjoyable to work for. sorry that i had to leave.
good,"I have learned a lot within the first six months before I was promoted to Assistant Manager. Although it was a little stressful, I have maintained my professionalism."
good,"Nothing bad to say ,good experience ,ounce had a conflict of interest with a supervisor, she uses her position as leverage, spoke to CEO he straightened her up quick ,obviously I had reason. Easy job quick pace some pressure, ounce you get the hang of things, it's all down hill."
good,Perfect place to work if being in retail management is of interest to you. This is a great company to work for that provides the ability to move up very quickly in ranks to gain that managerial experience needed to move forward with a career in the upper ranks of retail.
good,"I really enjoyed working here. It was a small team, so very little room for drama, however the repercussions of an employee calling out for the day could hurt. A typical day involved running the register whenever a customer needed to be checked out all the while working as much freight as possible and eventually zoning the shelves followed by a sweep and mop of the floors. There wasn't really a difficult part to the day unless you got swamped with customers and simply couldn't finish your stocking, etc. The most enjoyable part, was the work itself as there was always something to do."
good,my manager put her responsibilites as manager on everyone elses shoulders because she was  under quaified and  unsure what her job duties as manager meant
good,Good place to work.  Fast paced.  Great opportunity for advancement. Family atmosphere. No retaliation policy.  Teamwork and communication is key to success in the store.
good,It was an ok place to work. I really don't a good or bad thing to say. I wanted to go to second shift so could go to school and they were very accommodating.
good,I learned about how to properly unload a truck in a quick and organized way. Management would ensure that we were being safe and drinking enough water while we worked. It made me feel good to work for a company that cared about me physically as well as mentally.
good,"As a manager I've experienced how to create a schedule for employees, how to unload trucks, meet different people and see what its like to have some one come into the store an steal and how I handle it calm and quick."
good,"A typical day at work is to be on top of monitoring the system making sure all jobs are running correctly and not running long to act on any problems that may occur,to be able to answer calls and give proper answers to questions being asked on any given day you may have to direct problems to the correct department that handles that particular problem or be able to correct the problem yourself."
good,"I dont have much to say.It was a job that i took because i had to. The pay is not worth the amount of work they give you. On the other hand, you do have opportunities for advancement and incentive pay."
good,"Enjoy working with all my co-workers. Work is detail oriented and critical to store's receiving the correct product on time. Compensation is fair, department manager does a great job keeping the team engaged."
good,Family Dollar gave me the necessary tools needed to excel in my career via promotions. It taught me how to be the retail manager that I have come to be.
good,The amount of work that is required for the pay is not adequate. The rush to finish everything and feeling like you never accomplish the workload with the amount of time that is given to finish such task. The people I worked for were wonderful and we were like family. We all worked hard to accomplish everything that was put in front of us.we were the definition of team.
good,Family Dollar is a discount chain store. In Butler it is mainly lower and middle class patronage. The Manager has worked at this store for 10 years and is knowledgeable and friendly.
good,I enjoy working at family dollar but i want something better for me and my family. My general manager is excellent but he understand that i just want to better myself.
good,Working in retail at Family Dollar can be fun and allows you the ability to work on your skills in merchandising products while gaining knowledge in other positions. Management did a great job on keeping everyone updated to current expectations and worked as a team. You meet many different people whom you get to know and look forward to helping whether they're on the run or needing a specific item. There were great sales throughout the year that would drive customers to shop more which is great for the business and allows the employee to showcase the best deals and keep people coming back.
good,"-hardest part: not feeling secure due to being constantly understaffed (only a manager and one associate) and numerous  high dollar thefts per week"
good,"I've worked in a couple warehouses and it's all the same, hit your quota or pay the price. Here is decently difficult to make your quota but it is possible you just have to be very quick-paced throughout the entire night which is pretty difficult when you work 12 hour days but it's doable if you're in shape. Management was okay boss was extremely nice unless you can't make quota. Most enjoyable part of the job was the people each unit was pretty close knit and family-like. I learned quite a bit about how warehouses work and are operated, and a lot about working quickly and efficiently."
good,"Not a bad place to work honestly, but you won’t make enough to live off of if you have children! Part time cashier isn’t to bad, full time positions are horrible."
good,"There was always something to keep you moving and working, the customers were great,  a lit of team effort and a great environment. Definitely an experience I learned from."
good,"The hours of second shift were most difficult for anyone with a family. The hours could be very long when billings reached max output and the turnover was always an issue. Most days, each department was short-handed and made daily production difficult to obtain."
good,I was very happy here as I was a manager so I could run my own shifts. I enjoyed being my own boss as well as communicating with customers/upselling and suggestive selling to meet weekly quotas for my store.
good,"Your customers and your teams members drive the diversity and culture of your store."
good,"Family dollar can be a nice fun work environment with the right staff, I have had two different experiences with two different family dollars. and can say it all depends on who your coworkers are and if they follow policy or not."
good,Sometimes fast paced job that requires the ability to multi task and be efficient. Math skills are also and necessity and the ability to lift 50+ pounds is also a requirement.
good,I really enjoyed my time at Family Dollar. I had great hours and great pay. My manger was fair when it came to picking up hours. The only reason why I left was to move to Virgina
good,"Overall, this company is a good company to work for. The employees were great the upper management was great. The work wasn't challenging to the point where I was stressed out."
good,i made life long friends among my coworkers and customers. the work was hard at times we had problems with being understaffed so i often felt drained at the end of the day
good,i learned how to be more creative in a workplace . I also learned more social skills with a better range of people coming from a clothing store to an actual food clothing and household store.
good,I loved being an assistant manager. It was relatively easy most of the time and I worked with good people. It could be challenging at times but for the most part I really enjoyed it. I only left because I was seeking a career in the medical field.
good,"When you have regular customers that shop at the store because of the friendly staff, it makes their shopping trip worthwhile!"
good,Working at family dollar was okay for me I had a great team to work with and phenomenal boss. I would like it better if I had more hours and the job was more reliable
good,"The other employees were nice yet focused, the assistant managers were very polite with me, and the manager was respectful while also guiding me through the process of being an employee."
good,Pay sucks but the people are fun. That's about the whole of it. Nothing to complain. About or really speak highly of except the people that come in. Both coworkers and customers.
good,"Very nice in put together as a team everyone gets alone and customers love us, you just learn to know the faces and know what they coming in the store for."
good,Being at family dollar helped me to become more organized. It taught me to work in a fast-paced but relaxed environment as well as being in a diversed community.
good,"if your going to work here learn to play the game. adapt, not only to the work place but to upper management, learn to act and gain advantages, and power. if you can't enough to play ball and make the game fall into your favor, your going to be looking for another job. you need to realize, right now, that the world is garbage, it's not going to go how you want it, how you plan it, and definitely how you dream it. you have to reach out and tame it. weigh everything on a pro-con list. what does it gain you, for making an enemy of the people who have power over you? pain, suffering, and job loss. adapt people, this goes for any job, adapt, dominate your role, evolve, conquer. if you do this, you'll start seeing the things you need to learn to work for any company. you'll start enjoying your work. problem solve for your store, for your manager or even your assistant manager. they'll take notice, i do. and i keep those moments in the back of my mind when i choose who to advance, or to suggest advancement for. i don't care if your my best friend, if your work ethic is garbage your not advancing. i want a good hardworking team that are self initiating and can solve problems. "
good,Backend work with this company can be strenuous and fast-paced. Regular deadlines for work like u-boats during freight days are tight. The work itself varies from slow to hectic depending on the day. Staff is generally easy to get along with
good,"I enjoyed Working At Family Dollar had great co workers . The work environment was wonderful. My shift manger was a good shift manger and an understanding one, if I could go back I would."
good,"Working for Family Dollar was enjoyable, management taught me low, the work environment was good wouldn’t say there was a hard about the job as long as you enjoy what you were doing. The one thing I’ve miss about my job were the customers that came into the store, they became my family."
good,"Performed managerial duties such as cash handling, deposits into the safe."
good,Was a good job to have as long as you are willing to work hard an do your job well really helps if you are able to handle customer service with open mind an patient.
good,"Was a fun and productive place to work. However, managment could use work on showing more respect for their emlpoyees and customers too. Managment could also use work on how to maintain cleanliness in their stores."
good,It was alright place but you don't get 40 hrs a week. If you like working with customers you like it or work part time there you barley got hours. I like the people I worked with and manager just pay sucks and not enough hrs.
good,"This a company that positions itself as helpful to the community. and with its low prices, it actually is. It's the employees that the company doesn't care about."
good,Everyone works as a team to get everything accomplished. It is a fast paced place to work. The company is good to take care of their employees if they must work elsewhere or go to a meeting.
good,"A typical day would be clocking-in, meeting with the Store Manager, Counting your drawer for shift start, Performing shift changes with cashiers, and working on a designated task assigned by the Store Manager and or District Manager. I learned how to maintain Store paperwork, making schedules, checking in vendors as well as mandated opening and closing procedures. Management varies by Store and District some Managers work with their employees and others delegate task out to their employees. My Store Manager was dedicated, organized, disciplined, and hard-working he cared about our store and it showed in the stores overall appearance. The environment is family oriented hence the name, you get to know everyone you work with as well as your customers. The hardest part for me was working the freight. The enjoyable part was my co-workers and the customers."
good,"I wouldn't say that everyone would have the same experience as me.  I had a wonderful manager at my location, who definitely made the job more enjoyable."
good,"Worked there for 5yrs part time, had school as my main priority. Flexible with my schedule around school. Great place to work at with the right team doing their part to run the store."
good,This is an ok place to work if you don't mind being alone a lot.  The pay is OK and the Manager was really nice and worked side by side with staff putting out stock.  The major downside is you don't get breaks and often the restrooms are in back so you would have to leave the door open while you went so you could listen for customers coming in.
good,Its a great job as long as you like people and standing. The job it self isnt hard just everything is a possible write up and that gets annoying coming from jobs where you dont have to be so on it to were you get wrote up for someone else's mistakes is crazy to me.
good,nice environment and great coworkers. I worked at different stores in my district and it was always nice people and I was treated the same exact way!!
good,I loved working at family dollar I liked it so much that when they offered me the assistent superviser spot I took it & I also took it cause of the flexible hours...
good,"Great job. Loved the experience. Everyone was very paitent and generous. The manager nade the work experience better. The pay was great ,but i couldnt see myself advancing."
good,Relaxed and laid back work. Flexible with my hours. Got to see many different people come into the store and shop. I liked scanning items and helping people find what they are looking for.
good,I loved working there and my manager renee.Canaan was awesome. If u messed up she tell u to try again and take your time she helped us work and not just stand around.
good,"On a typical day it was very faced paced and pretty stressful. We were expected to lift merchandise that weighed anywhere from 5 to 40+ pounds. Truck days were even more stressful. I didn't mind the pace or the stressful atmosphere, but it was the pay that I did not like. I was promised one wage but was giving a different one. The pay rate was one of the main reasons I left employment."
good,"I always got to meet new people and grew a good social enviroment for new people and my regular customers. I always greet everyone who comes in, and ask if I can help them find something. I will try to walk them to where the item is, or if I can't try to give the best directions."
good,"I felt like I learned a bit more about retail while working for Family Dollar. I learned to work in a more fast-pace environment with a lot more to stock and a lot more customers to look after. At first it seemed like it could have been a lot, but very shortly after, I felt much better about working there and what seemed like a fast-pace environment turned out to be a good routine for me."
good,Family Dollar Provides a very necessary service to the community while at the same time providing Jobs. Providing a great deal of self realization.Go Family Dollar!
good,"The environment was great . The store was very competitive with others store. The work required stocking, pulling merchandise from the back. Ringing cus"
good,"Pretty good job, managers were nice.  Be warned, if you do not give a full two weeks notice this company will put in against you with future jobs.  I was not hired at another retail job due to this, after five years they still put in against me. I desperately needed that job so I contacted my former manager and she tried to help, giving me Human Resources phone number.  I never could reach them and they would not return my call."
good,Work hard and promotions come...once promoted daily work load increases..can be very stressful at times..customer service is an absolute must..must be willing to clean stock and whatever else is needed
good,"My co workers are amazing people, helped out whenever they could, flexible. It was the customers that made it a bad work environment. Nothing but drug addicts and and people just bringing problems came into the store ALL the time."
good,"i loved working here and the experiences that I had there helped me with other jobs that i ended up having.  It was easy in the mornings, slightly busy during the midday but it always slowed down at night. The management were very professional and kind. They wanted to train you successfully . I enjoyed talking and meeting new customers everyday."
good,"Very busy and productive work day. I learned money handling, and the opening and closing process. Management was very nice. The workplace culture was great. The hardest part of the job was working with a crew of only three. Which led to hardly no time off. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers."
good,Working for Family Dollars is a great place to work. The only thing its not allowing me to spend time with my kids. At the same time you are learn skills that can be used at other employer's in the future.
good,"It was a very easy job, calm and quiet most of the time, except for peak season, it gets a little chaotic around the holidays. Nice people, relaxed work environment and plenty to learn."
good,Mondays are the busiest that's the day of the truck. Management was responsible to receive the truck and run the front of the store. Hardest part being the only one with the ability to voids or returns while receiving freight.
good,"Family Dollar was definitely one of the easiest jobs I've ever had. Literally all you have to do is stock and work the register. There are times when the store gets packed, but mostly it""s slow paced. The pay is terrible though. I was hired as a Customer Service Rep and got paid 8.50 with no benefits. My manager hired me for part time, but I always worked 40+ hrs a week (which i didn't complain about since the pay is so bad). I think this is a job more for students in college, definitely not a career option."
good,"Interface with customers to identify purchasing needs and direct them to appropriate department; recommend additional products or cost-effective alternatives to enhance service and satisfaction."
good,"Before this was a Dollar Tree it was a Family Dollar,when it was family dollar most customers were from the neighborhood.Because of that it was a lot of stealing and arguments with customers."
good,Been around good people good customer service and I was good at scheduling employees payroll and hiring people did a lot of unloading trucks and kept my own people watching four thieves making sure the money goes towards the bank
good,Fun and friendly people to work with. I had several regulars to my store that became friendly acquaintances. Many were sad to see me leave. My managers were understanding for illness.
good,overall good experience at family dollar. I liked working there and i worked as cashier but the people who work there are not very intelligent. I would reccomend this job to somone.
good,"Typical for managerment 36 hours.  Store Manager as i was 80+ salary.  work cashier register, stock shelves, help vendors.  redo schematics which are monthly"
good,its very balance sometimes it can be very stressfull other days it runs by smoothly. everyone typical are almost like family once you start working there
good,"There were days when I was scheuled to work from open to close, 16 hours a day. I am good at saving my money, so there is no really no reason that I need to be scheduled for 16 hour days. I had school and a life outside of work and was not on board with the lack of direction from management."
good,Most urban areas have little to no security so you must be very attentive while working. Be expected to work on multiple tasks as there usually only you and your on-duty manager.
good,Family Dollar has a nice working environment and the staff is friendly.My manager is very fair on putting together the schedule.my most enjoyable part of my job are my customers.
good,good place to work. I loved customer service meeting different people and helping them in their experience was rewarding in itself. The job gave you the chance to be yourself.
good,"Family dollar is a great workplace. They treat you with respect and actually show care in you as a person. With me working 2 jobs at the same time, I barely saw my son and I couldn't get any rest. It just wasn't healthy for me."
good,Stayed  very busy during work hos. Always stock to put out.I enjoy meeting  different  people               from all walks of life. Every day something different.
good,Not enough hours to maintain store and stock shelves. The company runs an unsafe work environment because most of the time I'm working alone in the store for almost 40 hours of my work week. No maintenance is being done to help with the store upkeep. Underpaying the employees causes a high turn over rate so it's hard to keep a good staff.
good,It just didn't work for me because I moved. I would have stayed but I felt it was time for me to go. The mangers we all great to work with. I enjoyed my time while I was there.
good,It is a great place to start a career. They offered me fair pay and treated me fairly well. It was a little stressful but not a bad place to work. The staff is great to work there as well.
good,"the job was good it taught me a lot I was able to move up quickly I for that to have been one of my very first jobs, it allowed me to learn about customer service and all that it entail and leadership"
good,the team was good. pay was decent for dealing with customers. over all it was a good company. Manager was friendly very fun. Hardest part was not enough registers.
good,I love working in customer service because It give me a chance to help those that comes looking for something to please there needs. It was a stressful job being a true manager and dealing with different people attitude. I've learn to deal and talk to other with kindness and with a smile. it kept them coming back to the store. I lost that job due to they didn't like how I ran the store and they let me go for no reason
good,"After becoming an employee at Family Dollar as an Assistant Manager for 5 months, I was promoted to General Manager and given a store. It was a great opportunity that allowed me to grow in the management field. After one year as General Manager I became weary of the extended hours and realized that it was time for me to move on to the next level, also discovering that retail wasn't an industry that's most desirable for me."
good,I liked working for the company. I learned a some valuable tools during my time there. Under a capable and caring store manager Family Dollar can be an excellent place to work
good,"Great job with Great Benefits and Hours."
good,"A typical day at work, average relaxing."
good,"What I loved the most about Family Dollar was merchandising, always changing and the opportunity to grow, I learned a lot and I will always be Thankful for the opportunity that was given to me."
good,"Its a great job if you like working with the public. However if you cant handle the stress of a huge crowd coming in all at once while also trying to move product, its not exactly your best fit."
good,"basically like any other customer service job, talking with and helping customers, stocking shelves and maintaining freshness of the food and or perishable items"
good,"In my opinion, Family Dollars was an great place to work. The store manager was very flexible with the working around my home and school schedule. The work was easy and fast past. The regulars would always make your day."
good,They offer advancement fast.  Just have to have the right manager and district manager.  they dont a have that good support system in place.  but again you can make money and advance
good,"I loved working for Family Dollar. Jus don't agree with some of their policies. An need to be working 35-40 hours. Didnt like working long shifts without help like weekends when its busy. You cant ve on floor or helpibg customets because you have no help, an you are stuck at cash reg."
good,"Very hard work, very stressful work, but if youre a hard worker and you can keep the store staffed it will work out fine, you have to be prepared to be more than an logistics manager and you will have to find that balance to be successful"
good,"Busy At All times. Learn a lot from being a CSR To Management. There is potential to advance. We have all types of nationality in the community. Learn from The Job & Customers how to handle store. Hardest part of the job is dealing with Local Shoplifters & Scammers. Long as you do everything right, things should work smoothly. For me i just love to work."
good,"I absolutely loved working at  Family Dollar. It was a very fun job.  I really did not learn anything new . Working retail for years , it was much the same. I loved the management team. Great work place. The only thing I did not like, was the amount of hours of some days that I had to work constantly standing and never having any scheduled lunch or breaks. My customers of course was the best of the job."
good,I work the night shift  it was a stead pace always have something to do. mostly everyone was team players on the job. the hardest part was jus making it though the night. the enjoyable part was the people I worked with.
good,It's a good store to work for. I just had issues with management at the time. Manager was very disrespectful and was talking to other co-workers about me on a personal level.
good,Working at family dollar is fun. I like meeting new people everyday. The regulars come in everyday just to have  conversation with you. the job is pretty easy.
good,good place to get your foot in the door for IT experience. must be able to deal with assisting frustrated managers while remotely resolving issues. ...
good,I like a pleasant and nice environment to work in.  I also like friendly people. Having the proper lunch and break periods is also a plus. I really enjoy helping out anywhere I can.
good,"It is fast pace but it was quick some days because of everything that needed t be done, a lot is required but once you learn the routine its not that bad of a place to work at"
good,"This place kept a smile on my face when I got to see and deal with my regular customers. Some of the staff were awesome and some were not. Growing with this company was eligible, but was not for me at the time. If had to do it again I would."
good,"Overall, my experience at family was a decent experience at best. The pay was a little low but the benefits were very fruitful. Although, with the high turnover rate with both regularly part time employees and full time employees, I was put in a position was I required to do more work for the same pay including some details outside of my part time required tasks. For me it was a challenge at first but I was able to come out on top. Unfortunately, what warranted my leave of Family Dollar was my safety in the operation hours with every store in Racine being robbed at gun point."
good,"This job was exciting to come to it was sometimes very busy which I loved .my favorite part of this job was truck days I learned​ how to receive shipment's and file the paperwork, unload trucks and service costumer's​."
good,"Family Dollar can be as fun as you make it.  It all depends on you and your work crew.  If they are all against you or you are against them then work can be very stressful, frustrating especially when nobody wants to respect you.  If you all get along and have a good crew then you are family.  You become a family."
good,Family Dollar was fun and you work hard a lot. My typical day at work was okay because you normally see the same people every day and you get use to what they come in the store to get.
good,"it was a fun environment to work in . the people were pleasant to work with. also it was great showing customer service to the community,also meeting and greeting all kind of people"
good,At the time my manager was no good. If it wasn't for her I would probably still be working there.  Things were not fair and and it was hard to be able to take any time off.
good,I learned a lot and grew from my time at family dollar. I grew as a cashier and my speed as a cashier improved. I enjoyed the smiles customers had as they came in or left the store.
good,"It has been a very interesting and educational place to work, I have learned many new things and I have become a very good manager throughout this process. It has been a great place to work but I need something that is closer to my home."
good,"•	Handled cash and operated register "
good,"I think this is a great job for a first job! teach you how to use the register, keep area clean; just the basic to keeping the job. Not as stressful as any other job, fair pay i think!"
good,I had enjoyed working there people were nice and we all got well with each other. The manager was awesome I really loved it. I would love to go back and work.
good,It was a hard working fun environment! I was a shipping loader on 2nd shift and really enjoyed working on the team! It was a face paced place with the ability to earn incentive based on how hard you work!
good,I enjoyed the customer service experience and helping the customer by going above and beyond to improve customer relations. I didn't enjoy the non-organizational view of the store but I had fun with the customers.
good,"During my time working at family dollar it was clear that not many opportunity for advancement and the respect you received was minimal,never got a real break"
good,"it was a good place to work had its ups and downs. team work was good but not great. the pay was decent but the pay could be better and the benefits could be better as well . I loved the customers and most of the staff they were pretty great. The work can be pretty hard if you cant multitask several different things/jobs at once but if you can multitask several things at once then you'll be fine. Breaks are too short for the amount of hours and work put in, this company can over work you to the bone if you don't watch it and sometimes can get quite stressful, you learn a lot of different skills especially great customer service is top priority. yes there are job advancements"
good,Typical day was me opening the store at  9 a.m and ending at 9 p.m.I learned responsibilities of being in charge of other people and policies and procedures of the company.Also handling money in the safe and making deposits to the bank nightly
good,Easy going job great work enviorment. The people that come in are friendly and job is overall easy. The hardest part about my job is that customers leave the bathroom a mess.
good,They helped me when ever I needed help whether it was at home or at work. The pay wasn't the greatest but they will work with everyone to make a scedual that fits your needs. They are willing to train you on what ever you wonna learn. Even if there is no spots available to move up at that time.
good,"I have enjoyed working for the company, but the store I have is a huge commute and the options of getting stores closer to home haven't been available"
good,"You have to work some holiday. It's long hours but you feel like you are important. You have to unload the truck piece by piece,  it's hard work but it's fun. You get to know your customers. You feel heard by the company."
good,"no issues at this job . I have been with them for over a 1 yr an 8 month located in several areas around Huntsville, al all the store are great there is never any issues"
good,Most enjoyable part is the job security and opportunities to advance. The upper management in the facility is very associate oriented and takes measures to create a positive work environment.
good,"Guaranteed 40 hours a week. Did not receive breaks, but love working with customers. Management wasn't very good but the experience was life changing, learned many skills. Family dollar needs security, was robbed twice & needs to give better raises.  I was an assistant manager for 5 years and did not receive a raise until my 5th year on the job, & all I received was less than a dollar."
good,This job is amazing for a first job or if you want to start your career in management . Wether you stay in store or go to corporate its an excellent start
good,I like working for family dollar the only issue is that they do not give raises I feel they would keep employees longer if that was available . Also it takes a long time advance up far as assistant managers
good,typically was trying to keep busy in between customers coming in. a convenient store is very fast paced but a good experience.Management was easy to get along with but didn't really work with one until the morning shift coming in.My co-workers were all hard workers as well.They didn't leave unfinished for the next shift.The hardest part was staying busy when working overnight hardly any customers coming in or dealing with the intoxicated customers coming in late.The enjoyable part was knowing that I did my job and did it very well.The compliments from managers coming in the morning about how clean the store was.
good,Good Company to work when you have managers that are on one accord when training. Some managers are Awesome and some are not very friendly or professional and have to remind you how long they have been with company all the time but don't assit you as needed and will not help you when you need assistance. Some Managers are so concerned about everyone elses positions. HR does not have your back when you really assistance with rude unprofessional managers
good,"In my experience, this job you have to have a taste for. You handle people all day along with stock shelves and using the register. While sometimes it has its downsides, it has been a great place to work. Good pay, good people, and a great environment."
good,It was okay for the time I was there.  Location was not the best. And management did not have a strong presence. But the job overall was okay.  And paid decent
good,"Everybody work as a team. it easy work and  a lot of work to do. They want the work done all in one..like it no tomorrow. "
good,"Great job with room for advancement, easy with the right team and management. Ideal job for anyone who enjoys dealing with the public. Some days great others not so great."
good,I loved working there I learned so much new things how exchange things and more filing out paperwork for a lot of things I just loved experience I had at that store a lot of great people
good,Great place and good environtment to work. Flexiblr hours and great place to work. I liked my job nothing hard to do woth co workers. I would like to rejoin just with a better schedule.
good,Your typical day at Family Dollar is a fast pace work environment. Generally working the register to serve the customers or stocking shelves with the morning crew. Ideally for anyone with great multitasking skills or anyone who loves to keep busy/active.
good,"Overall, my experience at Family Dollar was relatively good. Like any job, there were days where the frustration made you question whether it was worth it. But the relationships built with the regular customers and never really having a dull moment, made it all worth it in the end."
good,"A typical day usually starts around 12pm and with an initial review of the store to see what I have to deal with for the shift and then move on from there. After that start moving the freight to the shelves and in between all that fulfill my customers needs, from simple things like finding an item, to employment inquiries, as well as returns and complaints. When my Store Manager is not there I preform their tasks and responsibilities, as well as my own, so I know how to run the store in their absence. Management is professional and to the point but not high strung. As for my co-workers, we go through cashiers, I've seen and trained a good number of people, but that seems typical of general store retailers. My long term co-workers are professional and generally pleasant to be around. There really are no hard parts to the job other than corporate shenanigans and irate customers, but it has it's own gratification at the end of the day."
good,"On a typical day at work, I push stock and at the same time show excellent customer service. At the end of each shift I am required to clean up and have the stock room ready for my coworker."
good,"i loved to work at family dollar i enjoyed my time there, the job taught  me a lot of thing and gave me more customer service skills. i greeted customer upon entree to the store  i rang customers merchandise  and stocked shelves as well as maintained clean and orderly work area."
good,"This was my first ever job, I was straight out of high school when I was given the chance to work there. I worked hard and before my first year was up I had already been promoted to assistant manager with a decent raise. Truck day was one of the hardest and busiest days of the week. I enjoyed that we got paid every week. I was there almost 3 years before the store shut down."
good,"At Family Dollar we are like family, we joke we laugh providing better result. Sometimes my wife brings food to everybody, we eat together in our break time, and an other day is someone else turn to cook and bring food. we share love, respect and appreciation. together we are one that's why we consider ourselves a family."
good,Family dollar is a good company to work for but a temporary job Is not a good way to review an employer. I cannot accurately define the experience of working for family dollar based on 3-4 weeks of work.
good,Some days had me coming home with great stories. I learned the ins and outs of what it takes to run a large chain of stores. The management could use some more training. The hardest part was undertrained co-workers.
good,"I loved working for this company because I am a approachable person, and I love dealing with the public. I also like making people happy."
good,Family Dollar is a clean shopable store. I love working for family dollar because I get to meet so many new people. We also get a lot of opportunities to move up in the company when something comes available. The district manager is so nice.
good,typical day at work was me coming and having to do what ever the last person didn't finish or even start. I learned to speak up for my self. The manager wasn't very good at her job. Some where good and some cared more about talking about the customers than doing there job. unloading truck was hard. I got to meet new people everyday and old friends.
good,It's a competitive place to work but you have no life.  The money and advancement are great though. Benefits are great for full time. Lots of changes
good,"A typical day at family dollar is stocking shelves, and unloading trucks and helping the customers and giving excellent customer service. Management has its up and downs"
good,"Inventory, stocking, and customer service. The team always wanted to go the extra mile to please the customer. the hardest part of the job was unloading the stock from the truck."
good,i enjoyed working there but there werent really enough options to move up in the business. The store manager would leave for the most ridiculous reasons sometimes and expect everyone else to pick up the slack.
good,"Family Dollar is hard work. More work, less pay. The bright side is I love working with my coworkers. We have fun joke and get the job done."
good,great management great coworker but not enough security with the rate of crime focused  on this type of business. the hardest part for me was the long day of standing
good,Working with Family Dollar is great for the individuals who like working with the public. My co-workers and follow managers make you fill like family and not just another employee. The hardest part of the job is that the managers have to do the unloading of the deliveries and stocking for the entire store.
good,"Typically a day at work would be assisting customers with their transactions, putting away stock, using the FIFO method when putting away perishable items, sweeping the floor, and mopping. "
good,we worked very hard but was still able to socialize and have a good time at work. if the head manager was mad the whole day would be kinda downing but when they left everything would be a good flow. being able to go to work and work as a manager was the most enjoyable thing about the job.
good,"Good place to work, many opportunities to advance if your willing to put in the effort. Some long days ,and frustrations with Corporates  IT issues that never seem to get fixed."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers. Being able to help and meet new people is a joy. Just wish i had a more payroll to make our days a little more manageable.
good,"simple environment to work in, decent pay for the job description. Decent benefits, easy to communicate with the upper management"
good,I love the day to day rush as a cashier and meeting new people. I like the fact that we got 40 hours a week or close enough. I didnt approve of the manger and how he ran things
good,"I enjoyed this job but would not work around my school schedule. Other than that, I would have stayed longer than I did. Work could  become hectic at times."
good,It was a learning experience. I became in contact with a few employees that helped show me the ropes. I really enjoyed my job.
good,"At first, the hardest part was doing stock. The biggest experience builder was doing the cash register. This was a highlight of the employment."
good,"It was a steady job, which allowed a process to learn through repetition. Opening store and closing store was the main differences, where as going through day to day process was cashiering and providing customer service while stocking. I've learned more when it came to the coordinating schedules with other stores, which includes inventories. All of the management team worked together in unison to be able assist each other in times of need for hiring. The hardest part of working with other stores in the district was balancing staffing budget and assisting these other stores. The struggle with the company was change in ownership from Family Dollar to Dollar Tree."
good,"I worked for family dollar as a temp worker. I set up three stores. Unloading trucks, pricing the shelves, tagging, cleaning, cashier, building the shelves, store placement. It was hard work but I learned a lot working here. My coworkers were all hard workers as well. The hardest part of the job was getting up early to travel to work."
good,"was one of my best jobs"
good,Fun fast-paced environment with great people who help each other during all hours of the day during all shifts on a daily basis.
good,Great places to work. Some days are fast paced and some are slow. You have the chance to advance forward if you work hard at it.
good,"Enjoy staff and most customers, small hometown feeling except for ""regular shoplifters"". Stores are for the most part understaffed and associates are not recognized by upper management."
good,"I enjoyed working here. All my coworkers were friendly with each other and the customers. I had to leave this job because I was not going to be able to work and finish my externship on time. I had the opportunity to meet great, nice people there that till this day we keep in contact."
good,Family Dollar is a really good job if you can get in there. There are plenty of advancement opprotunities within the company.
good,The overall management position was a great experience for me as I love mentoring and training new employees to form a great team atmosphere for everyone to work.
good,I learn how to do inventory there and there was my best cashier experience the customers there were really friendly i got to help alot of people out they gave e alot of hours because i love to work
good,"open/closed store, ran registers, supervised employees, check inventory, clean backroom, stocked floor, cleaned around the store when needed. put discount tags up on merchandise, change seasonal theme. set up displays"
good,"loved the flexibility in merchandising, the ability to work with some autonomy, love the open door policy, love the changes that are coming with the merger"
good,great experience love the job !!!!! Its a great business where you can start and progress with the right team. I have a positive team and an understanding manager .One of the best jobs I can honestly say.
good,"My day usually started counting the safe and making deposit from the night before. From there loss prevention operations (review voids, refunds, cancels and watch DVR). Get registers started and then off to the floor make sure store was neat, faced, recovered and safe by osha guidelines. After that welcome cashier and download gameplan an addition to ringing customers. I was usually back up on register. Form there unlock doors and greet customers. Greeting and helping customers, loss prevention (external) and keeping the store neat and faced is a constant throughout hours of operation. Then I would complete my daily task for the day which would usually be stocking sales floor, inventory counts, reviewing internal shrink, inventory counts, merchandising or setting aisles according to planogram, setting displays, organizing stockroom, marketing ads, or training."
good,"Nice staff, great team, nice hours. just unsafe with no security. high theft, team building is a must there.supportive management"
good,I have always been a people person but i learned more about different people and how to deal with them; it's not as bad as people would think.
good,"I enjoyed working at Family Dollar because of the customers and management we worked for. Security was the biggest issue because we would have to have one person running the whole store in the morning to meet payroll guidelines, which was dangerous at times due to the area the store happened to be in."
good,Tended the cash register. Learned how to work with transactions. Got along with fellow employees. worked as a team with the up keep of the store.
good,I enjoyed my time at family dollar. I met a lot of people and they made my time go by everyday. I have learned a little bit about ASM checking in items and also returns.
good,"Great Company and I have learned alot of accounting with Family Dollar, a typical day at work is very busy. Great Team Members being productive and continue to get the Job Done until the merger takes place with Dollar Tree."
good,"It was a fast paced, rapid but  very friendly workplace! I enjoyed the freedom of my schedcule and the hours given. The company could improve more by not making everyone a manager within the first few day of them starting work"
good,Customers like the great prices and products that are sold in there stores. Customers like the sales that are brought from the company. Keeps you busy and makes the day go by
good,Typical work day was filled with many tasks but none that was too time consuming. I learned may skill about customer service and how to use a cash register. Management was flexible and caring.
good,"i bring excellent customer service to family dollar with cash handling and finding items for customers ,making sure that the store is organized and clean .and for the trucks to be unloaded with merchandise brought to the floor and stocked"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people everyday and getting to know each customer likes and dislikes. I also enjoyed making my customers smile even if they walked in with a frown.
good,They had a healthy environment and gave me my job duties and let me get to work on stocking and recovering the store. Cleaning the parking lot and collecting carts are the things the co-workers and managers had me doing when there wasn't much to do after I finished my job duty.
good,The job was very nice.  The store was always a mess when I got to work and it was my job to put it back together.  I liked organizing it.
good,"The problem with this company was that there were not alot of opprotunities for advancement. However, the job was fun and informational."
good,job was good until i had ri deak wuth sine rathers not so good issues. being able to run a store was nice and meeting new people was an experience.
good,"Wonderful company to work for, Management never made weekly schedule. Benefits were great as well, balance between work life and home life could not be separated as on days off I was always getting called to solve one problem or another, or on days I was working, other Assistant manager would not show up for shift so plans with my family had to be cancelled for me to work their shift."
good,"*Challenging to compete with Oil field "
good,"Most days were funny, good environment, nice people to work with, I learned to have good team work, think at a fast pace, and able to stand for hours at a time. There wasn't really anything really hard at this job. The most enjoyable part of this job was being around all of the nice co-workers."
good,The typical day at work long but different every day learn how to unload trucks and stock the shelf. Co-workers there to help much as possible.
good,"To sum it all up, any task for me was easy of course because of my experience. Whether I was doing stock, inventory, or cashiering.The customers are very outgoing and easy to help. The managers on the other hand was  unknowledgeable. They need more experienced managers with more knowledge. The benefits were great .It wouldn't let me select the stars on the compensation and benefits on here. My co workers work very hard unnoticed. I've learned how to deal with to deal with some of the most uncommon problems people usually do not deal with at work.I also have a lot of patience because some of the situations. My most enjoyable part of my job was being a assistant manager. Keeping the money coming in and customers satisfied made me happy. It felt good to have no worries."
good,"Shipping and loading contains a lot of heavy lifting and heavy boxes up to 75lb. This job is a very difficult one, most people cant hang. I actually loved it, it allowed me to move frequently and be more flexible with timing, we had  a certain amount of time to load the truck."
good,a typical day at family dollar will be busy with a little bit of down time. what i learned working at family dollar knowing what it takes to work in a very busy environment being able to keep a fast past for long amounts of time. i also learned how to keep store neat and presentable and also knowing what different types of work tools are called and what they are used for. as far as management its okay could be better. my co-workers was okay they where good workers just slacked of at times but they where cool. the hardest part of the job well at the time was when i had to unload the delivery truck which had 700 boxes and packages of various sizes and my arms was hurting and i was tired but afterwards it became more easier. my most enjoyed part of the job was being able to be apart of the family dollar team.
good,"Typical day includes opening the store, managing employees, schematic resets, setting up seasonal displays, and counting deposit. We hired 0 employees from the day I joined for 3 years. It was a very stable work environment with zero employee turnover so I think I got lucky with great employees. The hardest part was trying to do everything that was needed to be done in the time frame given. At times you I needed to run the register, approve returns, and set up a display all while being visible to customers to lower shrink. The most enjoyable part of the job was when holidays would come and I would get free reign to do whatever I wanted with seasonal displays."
good,"I was the store manager & enjoyed the fast paced environment."
good,"A typical atmosphere for a retail company, a lot of meeting and a lot of analyzing data. Co-workers are friendly and management team is always willing to help."
good,Very much enjoyed my time with Family Dollar. I met a lot of great people and worked with some very loving and caring ladies and gentleman. Love the fast paced environment.
good,"Family Dollar is hard work, especially on the management team. You have to be able to come to work, perform, and focus on the store and its consumer body. If you enjoy being a team and working with others like a family, then this job is a great job. The team member body does not change. If you are employed, you are employed until you leave. Most Family Dollar stores have an employee body made up of five or six people. Every employee has an opportunity for advancement."
good,productive work place assist all team members in right areas and complete daily task
good,Wasn't a difficult job position. Workload could become very repetitive.
good,"Family Dollar is a fast-paced, ever-changing place to work.  The structure of the company is well organized, although the implementation of policies varied from district to district.  Overall, I was very pleased with my experience there and would recommend them as a fair and rewarding place to work."
good,"I can honestly say that I loved my job there. The customers was my number one motivation. I spent most days busy stocking,rearranging, and helping customers. It was more then a job to me it was my home."
good,"A typical day at work would be for me to clock in and after I clocked in if I was closing to count the safe and if I was opening to open the store and gather all paperwork from the previous business day. After that was complete I either got on register until my next employee came in or I started working on things that came off the truck, that needed to be put out on the floor."
good,"I loved working for the company we were just required to work to many hours.We could work up to 90 hours in a weeks time.We were required to work every holiday.Family Dollar is open for every Holiday. I have been a manager but, being a store manager I learned how to review P & L statements, how to do billing summaries.The hardest part of the job was having to let people go when they did not adhere to company policies.I really enjoyed the job I am a people person so the best part about the job for me was being able to be in close contact with the public."
good,"Though I liked interacting with the customers and being able to run the store, at the same time, it was highly stressful. Having to deal with rowdy customers and shoplifters was an unfortunate downside of the job. Also, being Assistant Manager, I had to work a lot of hours and rarely would be able to get out of work at the time I was scheduled to leave. Overal though, it was for sure a learning experience and I would still love to work in a retail setting in the future, just may be in a better area."
good,"I have learned a lot since working here such as how to handle money and deal with the public. I enjoy working here and seeing what this company has to offer. My boss and co-worker's are easy to get along with and are always very helpful. The hardest thing is the long hours on my feet, if I didn't have to stand so much I'd feel a lot better at the end of a shift. I enjoy being able to help customers get what they need at decent prices and making people happy."
good,The hardest part of the job was dealing with the schedule which sometimes conflicted with school.
good,A typical day at work I love and enjoyed is the non stop movement. Working with different people each and everyday. helping people look for their household items and looking for sales.
good,I would assist customers in finding the products they are looking for. Applied coupons and cashed out customers. Every week I would unload a truck full of products to stock on the shelves. At times my manager was forgetful when it came to providing schedules. I enjoyed working with my managers and co-workers we all got along really well. All the customers that came into the store were really friendly.
good,Customer Service begins and ends at the door . I started as a cashier and made it to an Assistant Manager.This has been my favorite place of employee because of the array of people i have encountered and the customers that are so easily satisfied
good,A great place to work with fun co-workers. The company wants so much out of a little store and they want you to stop people from stealing putting yourself in harms way.
good,"Productive, fun place to meet a lot of people. Working with my co-workers to solve specific problems. The most enjoyable part of the job is to see the smile on a customer's face when u play a major role in solving their problem. Free lunch and short breaks. The hardest part of the job is trying as much as possible to meet up deadlines."
good,i enjoyed my time working for family dollar. it was my first time in retail and i learned a lot.
good,I went in at 9:00 am and left at 4:30 pm. I help reset the food section at the store. I learned that you have to work hard at this job. I enjoyed working with my Team Lead and meeting  my new co-workers. The hardest part of the job was reaching the high shelves. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people from everywhere and the pay was good. The job just didn't last long enough.
good,Working at Family Dollar was a great experience. It gave me an opportunity to learn a little about Retail and how things are done in this career field.
good,Helped customers with their purchases. Stock shelves with merchandize.
good,Never board...a lot of different issues to make a store operate and run smoothly.  Thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of the work.
good,"I learned how to Merchande and to use Planograms,  Focusing on the Customer."
good,show up get straight to work great break time n communication.
good,family was the best job I had it gave me the opportunity be be an manager
good,Very fast company to progress with however the lack of managerial help is not healthy.
good,Awesome company to work for. Always something new to do everyday. Loved meeting new people.
good,"Working hard and having good ethics does not go unnoticed. Family Dollar is a great place to grow, if you are a employee who shows the initiative to make this company work at or above standard there are manager positions always available. Being a manager in this company is the very essence of management, you are taught merchandising, cash handling, employee relations, and many different aspects on how running a business should go. The hardest part of the job is that you are constantly under corporate vision, and if your store isn't ran properly the weight is strained on management to do nearly the full work of the store. I've learned great things from Family Dollar and still are learning things as far as how to manage time and time of your employees, and how to run a building rather than just running a shift."
good,The only reason I left was I was promised a job at Rite Aid and more money which did not happen
good,"My day was very busy and productive. What I learn out of this was working fast, helping the customers with complaints and questions. Also, help my co-workers with any problems that they had. The management team was okay, and tried to help each other. the hardest part of my job was remembering so many combinations and making sure that everything in the store was correct before closing. What I enjoyed was the experience as ""Assistant Manager"" and being able to be a leader for my crew members."
good,"Good hours "
good,Worked there for six years and it was a very productive company.
good,"Family Dollar is a rapidly growing company with opportunities for advancement. Company is always adding new products and locations. Family Dollar expects a lot out of store managers and the workload is more than most managers are able to complete by company deadlines. Company is constantly reducing payroll budgets forcing managers to work excessive amount of hours to complete required operational duties. Duties in a typical day include administrative paperwork, maintaining store conditions, unloading trucks one box at a time, stocking merchandise with in a 24 hour time frame, hiring, training staff, scheduling staff within budgeted payroll dollars, providing excellent customer service at all times."
good,"I was a manager for the following towns for Family Dollar: Aliceville and Reform, Alabama and Macon, Ms.  I also help the District Managers in opening new stores and remodels. My job was to do modular, schedules, hiring, ordering, unload trucks, stocking, cashier, opening and closing store. Making deposits, making change for the store, running reports, getting the store ready of inventory and helping other stores with inventory.   I treated my employees with respect and always thank them for their work.  I made work fun and it seem that the work got finish quicker. My customers always enjoyed coming in and shopping because we were happy bunch and always greeted them by name.  The hardest part was the long hours and miss a lot of my time with my oldest daughter.   Everyone was happy!"
good,"My typical day at Family Dollar consisted of manager priorities. I opened the store and deposited the money from the night before. I assisted customers and kept track of employees work schedules. Money was accounted for, recorded, and drawers were set at the proper amount for the next shift. My prior experience with retail management was very key and made the job easy."
good,stock shelves operated cash register help customers with question
good,I was an assistant manager so my job duties were taking over the store when my manager never showed or left early. I have learned to manage a store and handle customers. I hated management! co workers were ok iffy than anything. hardest part was juggling everything at once.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the time spent with my Management staff, and the ability to maximize profits with good hiring practices, organization and time management, and training.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with situations that caused long work days, sometimes as much as 18-20 hours a day.  The end results were satisfying, but the road to that end result was sometimes very laborious."
good,"For management your day stared 7:30 am but can be earlier if you have an AM truck. Prepare store for opening, cash handling and bank deposits, running cash register, assign work for cashiers in between sales, cashing out cashiers till at shift change and closing. Setup new schematics, pricing, stocking, ordering. Greeting customers upon entering and leaving, customer assistance, checking in venders, unloading inventory truck, doing inventory.

At least once or twice a week managers work 13.75 hour double shift."
good,my typical day at work would be working in the cash register dealing with customers greeting them . i learned how to get more experience with handling cash .. my manager was very helpful at all times my co workers always worked in a team with me and helped me when i needed help there was no hardest part at work and i enjoyed working with customers and my co workers
good,"A typical day for me as a cashier included interacting with lots of customers, all from different ""walks of life"". I enjoy talking with customers as well as helping them with anything they need. I also enjoy working with the managers of this company, they are all very friendly, professional, and understanding. The hardest part of the job is when we get very busy, I'm usually the only register open in the store so when we get a return it often takes longer than usual and the line is allowed to back-up. At this time I just page the manager and ask for assistance, at which time they open the second register and assist with checking out the customers. The most enjoyable part is really everything, I enjoy cleaning and keeping the floor tidy and organized as well as my everyday interactions with our customers, new and regulars :)."
good,I moved up very fast with this company.  They worked well with me when I had my baby.  I loved working with the people plus seeing all the customers come in was a wonderful feeling.  Then came I time I was told to choose what is more important to me my family or my job so I had to choose and I chose my family.
good,Company is great to work at if you enjoy working in a fast paced store. Company treats employees good.

good,"A typical day at work consisted of opening the store, putting up/down sale signs, counting the safe, assisting customers, cashiering, cleaning, stocking, managing and training other employees. My co-workers made coming to work enjoyable. Management was very quick to resolve any issues that would arise."
good,"I come in loan on the register and make sure the other employee has enough change in their draw. Make sure they have had their breaks or see if they need to use the restroom. Then make sure everything is cleaned up and then I usually get through 4 between 10 U-boats full of product. In between getting shelves stocked I get cigarettes out of the case when needed along with change out of safe when needed. I make sure bathrooms are clean and stocked and also have to be with the other employee when customers come up for returns. I unlock the back door for people to use the restroom and help carry people's purchased items to their vehicles. What I have learned is how to set cams, end caps, and side panels, and the skills to become a better Manager. I love all of my co-workers and my boss is so amazing and makes sure I am involved with almost all projects so I can learn as much as possible. The hardest part of the job would be all the different tasks they expect to be done but we all as a team manage to get everything done each and every day. The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers and the stocking I love stocking the shelves and making people happy."
good,"Opening the store, stocking the shelves and helping the customers. that nothing in retail really surprises me anymore. Overall they did what was best for the company, as was to be expected. Our team was one of the better teams in the region. Having to unload the trucks and 7:00 am twice a week and continue to put up stock till two or three in the afternoon was a little hard at times. I really enjoyed working with the team we had, a great group of people."
good,the hardest part of this job is nothing. i became manage in two mouths.
good,"A typical day at work there consistis of stocking ,recovering, and cash managment. I learned more prodcutive customer service skills aquired a stronger work drive, how to use a cash register and plenty more.The managment was great. Had no isssues with any manager everyone friendly. The hardest part of the job was trying to deal with hostile customers and thieves. The most enjoyable part of my experience was working with the crew i was with they made the day less stressful."
good,"Stock, customer service cashiering"
good,"Overall Family Dollar Store Support Center is a good place to work, however benefits could use some improvement and the work-life balance could be better. The opportunity to grow and advance is good, however HR could be more consistent with expectations and communication to Team Members"
good,Leadership and Organization
good,"i was a assiastant manager at family dollar for 4 years, i started off as a cashier for like 6 months then had got bumped up to assistant because my work was over the top i worked two different shifts morning and night and different days every week. it was a exciting job you always did different stuff never bored. i managed the cashiers i unloaded trucks, did stock, check in venders, do payroll, count tills morning and night, and recovered the store at night. it was a good job. but the hours were not enough for me to survive off of"

good,Great place to work for a part time. Co worker where great helped each other with schedule conflict. But center office manager where out of touch.
good,Non stop fast paced work day with loads of tasks.
good,"Family Dollar has made a lot of progress committing to building teams and developing management internaly. As an Area Operations Manager (Urban District Manager) each week was built around upcoming inventories, scheduled store visits, Loss Prevention Audits and Investigations, managing the payroll budget for the district, and follow up on program compliance."

good,I liked working at family dollar their is room for advancement if you are a hard worker.
good,Family Dollar is a great place to work while in school or not. I was very happy wroking with this company!
good,"flexible hours  people friendly and a good work environment. Lots of advancement opportunities, Easy to understand computers and cash register . Over all its a good work environment with lots of support from Management"
good,I only worked there for about six months and over it’s a good easy first job my store had manger issues but everything else was no problem except the schedule  was really last minute
good,"My work experience was great. The employees were nice, we worked well with each other’s. The customer loved coming back to shop again. Great customer service."
good,I enjoyed my time working with this company until the last few months when new management stepped in. It was a wonderful company before Dollar Tree took over.
good,I enjoyed working with good people who encouraged you to work harder and grow as a person. I also enjoyed helping my customers so they left happy. It's a good place to work.
good,"Great company to work for, hours vary depending on payroll, benefits are decent they provide a little PIP. Customers can get very rude but you learn to deal with it"
good,None at this time. I felt really good when I worked there due to the people who came in and made it fun to be an employee there and someone who could help.
good,It wasnt for me I feel like I need a job were I can enjoy working there and have fun doing it I feel like this job is for a highschool student or a college kid.
good,"It's a good company to work for, but being a single mom of 2 i need more hours. The managers are very understanding if you speak to them, and our customers are the best."
good,I was an assistant manager for two years and I absolutely loved working at the family dollar and some of the customers still talk to me and say they miss me after 6 years of being gone.
good,The company is ok and fairly to work in but management is so what poor. I'm able to get the job done but so much drama was within the company and I felt I didn't need to be apart.
good,"This job actually helps your customer service skills, Having a pretty active encounter with people isn't always easy so this job helps you coupe with that. There are busy days and chill days."
good,Family Dollar helps me to become a person that would take charge and be the person that everyone can depend on. They also allows me to be me as well. They even given me time to go to school full time and work full time hours.
good,"it was an ok for the most part, some customers were nice and the coworkers were like family. great discounts and your able to get hours if needed because people dont show up."
good,"Meeting and greeting people every day .. helping them out with our merchandise to the best of my knowledge. Keeping the store clean and neat, unloading the truck and restocking."
good,It's an ok experience it's a very fast pace kinda job. The training is very quick and simple. Overall it is a great learning experience for anyone interested in the job.
good,Its an ok place. Just couldnt handle the district manager. She was to much. Plus Dollar tree bought them out and planned to get everyone out and hire new people.
good,"I loved working for this company, which every company or management are different. You have to be dedicated to keep up the good work. Stay busy and Customer Service is the number one factor."
good,Family Dollar is a great company too work for if have a decent store manager with the duties on track. I enjoy working for them hate I wasn't able too return back after my maternity leave.
good,"Overall I enjoyed myself at family dollar compared to other places. Yes, you will work, but if you want to take a break you can. Most of your time you're either stocking or checking people out at the register. It's a fairly small company and we didn't get too much business due to being in a small town, but there were times when you weren't able to take as many breaks as usual. Coworkers and customers are usually nice. Occasionally your get that one crazy but its not a daily thing. The hardest part about this job is the fact you don't have that one thing you do. Your job weather your a manager or a cashier  is stocking, cashier roles, unloading trucks, organization, schematics, pretty much everything except scheduling ( assistant managers might have to do that depending on the situation)."
good,It's pays weekly and u get to Kno alot of customer's and children that come there after school to get snacks.u get discounts and it's convient.its on bus lines to.
good,"Family Dollar was aright working experience, I don’t know if I would recommend the job due to the lack of organization, but it was a learning experience."
good,Great people to work for they are good to help you out if you run into a problem or if there is something you was doing that you did not know how to do
good,The employees are great people and so is the manager. It can be really flexible depending if you go to school or not. The store usually gets busy in the afternoon but there's always two cashier. It can be kind of dangerous because people are always stealing.
good,"Fact pace environment for people that need to be continuously moving.  Physical work, but overall great people to work with. Hourly benefit package is really good."
good,The managers were kinda rude especially the general manager she was even rude to the customers she don’t care how she talk to people. she would talking to people so rudely
good,"Pretty good for a first job, really recommend as a start. Manager was really nice and friendly everyone was very welcoming. The job itself was good."
good,High paced work where there is always something needed to be completed. Weekly reoccurring work. Customer service based work abilities are a must. Freight handling on the sale floor happens daily. Recovery of the store sales floor is also performed daily. Small teams with minimal payroll is the norm. Individuals working for Family Dollar should be highly motivated.
good,I unloaded the delivery trucks when they came once a week. We sometimes would have 1500 pieces of merchandise. Small loads would sometimes be about 800 pieces.
good,This is a good job to have if you habe customer service skills and work good as a team and have stocking and cashier experience i think more taining would have been good.
good,"Good place to work. It was a very good experience, very good companions. Organization could improve, within the weekly hours they did everything possible to finish all tasks."
good,Family Dollar will want you to work more than 52 hours with out overtime pay once you are a store manager because you on salary and they would let you work 60 to 70 hours a week with the same salary
good,"Its an okay job, lots of manual work to be done, on your feet the entire shift. This job is mainly for the younger teens looking for extra money after school."
good,"Very fast paced place,but yet exciting, and fun place to work, have great defense modes,and procedures for store   in case of emergencies. Price matching,and coupon accepted."
good,It's a good company to work for overall. They provide you what you need to to succeed within the company. The scheduling isn't really that flexible. They are impressive on their organization.
good,"Overall a great company, very friendly but slightly disorganized. Co-workers are friendly and polite. Reduction  on hours causing shorter shifts. Heavy lifting is daily."
good,My review for the company is that i wish they could do better about the employees we get robbed to much i feel like they dont care about us enough to give us security the work experience is good i just feel nobody should have to worry about getting guns drawn on them while they trying to make a honest living
good,The customers are nice and the employees as well . You will be able to learn multiple things. There will be opportunities to further yourself in life.
good,I learned about securities. Working on freights when the trucks bring a load to stock in our store. I learned about management and inventory. We make sure everything is organized.
good,Great company with pretty good pay. Sadly you are working a lot of hours and it’s pretty physical work. I loved my job. Great upper management and owners are caring. Weekly conference calls kept you up to date. Easy job to do just have to put some hard work into it. Promote from within usually so that was nice and motivating for new hires.
good,"Great place to work  learned how to use cash register ,seasonal changing of decorations and products. The manager is very caring works hard and would help teach you if did not understand. The b3st part of the job was greeting and helpimg customer's."
good,"A typical day at this work place could be very busy and intersting,I enjoyed meeting new people and assisting customers with finding things or answering any customer service questions they will have.The hardest part of job was days when it would be a very rude customer that I still had to assist.I learned how to maintain difficulty customers and satify each and every customer.The worplace was fair a little over crowded at times but would recommend this job site to others."
good,"Left due to family issues. I enjoyed my time there. You have to be a motivated person to work there & have compassion for what you do. If you have small children, being in management wouldn't fit for you because it very fast paced & requires you to be there all.the time basically."
good,loved that i was given the opportunity to move up within a month. I didnt believe in myself but i had great team members who helped me do so. thats why i love the enviroment
good,A better way to receive weekly truck and keeping the stock rooms and sale floor without so much Clutter. Giving assistance manager 40hr should be a must.
good,"I enjoy working for family dollar, however I am required to work every holiday as well as 48 hours minimum and can be an unlimited amount of hours with out overtime pay. The position takes away from my home life to a certain extent."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Family Dollar as a start up job in retail. The management team I worked with was fair and great to work with , and   allowed me the opportunity to do my job without micro managing."
good,I think that Family Dollar was okay. I mean it was easy work honestly. Consumers were okay. You have to learn where everything is in the store and have to be able to tell them at least what aile its on.
good,"Customers That Shop Daily At Family Dollar Were AWESOME! No Attitudes, All Smiles. They Knew Where Everything Was, Didn’t Mind Helping Others That Didn’t. Wouldn’t Hesitate to Inform Us Of Spills, Completely Helped Alot"
good,The overall management at the time was not so great but was able to move up really fast and learned everything very quickly. Mostly fast environmental but some down time to get things done
good,It requires a lot of work. You work with a lot of customers. Employees are awesome. Takes a lot of time from family. Pay is pretty good. Trucks Are big.
good,It felt like family with coworkers and customers. There were some bad seeds but it all worked out Great management. Good working enviroment fun place to be.
good,"Most days you are doing the same things stockings shelves, as management there are a few things that you are responsible for on a daily basis, such as getting cash making sure cashiers are keeping drawers to a minimum and things of that sort"
good,"I really liked working for Family Dollar, they had good training programs, decent opportunities for advancement and always kept a high standard for every store. Only complication I ran into was when I was supposed to transfer to another state and there was a lack of communication which cost me my Store Manager position. I would still be working for this company if it wasn't for the mix up."
good,"Great place to work, "
good,Management is quick to offer guidance and assist you when needed. Nice work atmosphere and the coworkers are all great people. Ample employee parking and plenty of other businesses in the area.
good,"I've been working at Family Dollar for four years in Panama City,Florida,but due to Hurricane Michael I relocated to Shertz,Tx. I've been here less than one week,but have been trying to transfer."
good,"Family dollar is the best job I’ve ever had. I’ve been there for 2yrs, although the clientele is tough at times, it has its pros just like any other job!"
good,i was a cashier and end up as a part-time assistant manager. a very good place to work and really enjoy the customers. got alone with everybody. ran the store by self taught me not to be afraid left alone it help me a lot and i love when i work at family.
good,Started off as a Assistant Manger. Learned and gained a lot of management skills. It's easy to grow with the company.  Schedule was pretty good. Work wasnot hard at all as long as you have a good team
good,Lovesd working here.. this particular store is in a bad area ..my reason for leaving. Many days I was working alone for 4 hours at a time on the busiest days of the month
good,Liked working with the team. Hours were great. Great workplace culture. Able to advance. Management treated people fairly. Customer friendly atmosphere. Able to learn Family Dollar culture quickly and effectively.
good,"Hours goes by quick on morning shift"
good,I really enjoyed working there because I got to meet different people. I started as just a cashier but then I started training to be Assistant Manager.
good,"The pay was not great, but interacting with my coworkers, supervisors and all customers was a lot of fun. Some customers would pass up other Discount stores just to come there. They love that I always had a positive attitude every single day no matter what the conditions  were."
good,"Most of the customers and all of your co-workers are great."
good,"I would sometimes open the store. Count the safe, set the registers, make morning deposits. I sat displays and checked in merchandise. Scanned in vendors and stopped anti theft."
good,"I like working their until one or two.of the people gave their notice "
good,"Customers are the only bad thing about working at this place. They expect top quality products for a dollar. Besides that, its a cool place to work for"
good,the only problem i would say would be the constant stealing from customers besides that it was an pretty chill environment if i was still younger i would probably go back
good,Must be productive with no chance to advance  I love the people I work with and enjoyed wat I did but the management gives little chance to advance in the job
good,"It t was a pretty good job for a college student, however i worked full time hours and received no benefits because they put me as a part time employee on the schedule."
good,"When I aplly they take fast and give my schedule , good place not born , manager very nice person , accessible, busy store, the customer is priority for the compani"
good,I really enjoyed the team I had. We opened a brand new store and instantly jumped to close to the top of the ranks in terms of sales. The store would have failed if we were not trained in how to be a great team and all work together.
good,"This company is combining forces with our parent company and relocating the local office to the new office in VA. It is a wise business decision; however, a lot of employees are being affected."
good,Family dollar was very fun to work for and make extra cash. the only issue that I had with the company over all was that they didn't have enough security we were robbed three different times in one month which caused me to search for other employment. I told the management my concerns and they didn't really care as long as there product was sold. not a safe place to work its not worth  your life.
good,aight nothing to retire with at a SM level; DM changed frequently and got progressively worse; 1st DM that hired me wanted me to quit and go with her but I was committed to the area I moved to.  Pay was okay; hours was horrible
good,I enjoyed working at Family Dollar I was very productive and I made a good amount of money. The best apart about working at Family Dollar was the hours I received. The worst part about working at Family Dollar was dealing with ignorant customers.
good,Working in an enviroment such as Family Dollar was an excellent experience. From the work to the team members was a great experience. Pay is great todo the weekly payout. This job also gives you educational opportunities. Such as going back to school for your diploma or GED. Its also a friendly relaxed environment. In need of help with your work station? Your team members will help as much as possible to assure you that you'll be fina as long as you pay attention.
good,I love my job but I never have tine for my family & the management is horrible. I started as a cashier and worked my way up. I work 6 days a week and must work 52 hours a week.
good,its a very exhausting place to work...very demanding ...but if you are a person up to challenges..that is the place.. .need to stay focus on the daily task
good,You typically see the same people every day or every other day. The current store manager is the best one I've had the pleasure to work with. Almost everyone who has been hired works hard and does a good job.
good,Family Dollar was my first real job and my manager took it easy on me. I had great hours and a good working experience. I wish the transferring process would have went smoother when i moved down the Hampton for school.
good,Fun place with good people to work with. Management usually takes the crews opinions and tries to implement them. The pay is competitive with other retail chains.
good,Family Dollar was a Job where I gained a lot of confidence. I was challenging as I had to be with the customer face to face and to work fast as it was always busy. I enjoyed that environment. The manager was very helpful and encouraging.
good,"ya family dollar is a wonderful place to work as a starter job but if you are ike me and need more I don’t recommend family dollar, maybe there benefits are better as a full-time employee but not as a part-time employee"
good,"When I applied I was told I'd get between 25-35 hours a week, but I've consistently gotten around 20. Although the job isn't difficult, and the people are nice, it's just not enough for me not to search for a job with more hours."
good,Always something to do kept me on my feet got to meet great customers unloaded truck stocked shelves made good friends had to manage a great store and loved it making it my own.
good,A workday here consist of opening the store. This comes along with money handling as well as putting away stock the company is a great one and is great for advancement
good,Family Dollar was a great place to work.  Treated well and compensated well for the work we did.  Kept busy and rewarded for the hard work.  Family Dollar was bought out and things changed for the worst.
good,I loved working there and I loved my coworkers! We became family and it made the job so much better! The customers were also pretty great! It was a lot work but it was a second home.
good,Every one was always nice and work very well together! Friendly and great customer service we all have our own flexible schedule and work together and everyone is respectful
good,I love going to work I thought I was gone work there longer but they made a mistake and took me off the schedule and something is  wrong with the system
good,Needed more constant work life balance. I felt I missed out on life to have a well paying job. I gave my heart to this place and keeping a good staff was hard because their pay was lacking
good,The store was a good place to work and provided a nice working environment. I was able to advance my management skill set. I learned a lot working here.
good,There is always opportunity to advance. Discipline and understanding the store policies are very essential when being a store manager for Family Dollar.  They also have benefits like 4021 K that you can take advantage of. I would recommend this job to anyone looking to expand their experience while working in retail.
good,Working at family dollar I learned how to stock shelves keep things organized I also learned great customer service skills greeting & meeting with customers
good,If you like a clean and organized work environment then Family Dollar is perfect for you. The customers are friendly and the associates are fantastic to work with. They have been very understanding and helpful with my schooling and second job.
good,"Enjoyed meeting new customer helping them out find what they needed enjoyed stock the shelfs, unloading the trucked was fun, but mainly enjoyed help the customers out"
good,"Taking care of customer, and team members , cleaning ,inventory,"
good,Family Dollar is a great place to start at when you are first looking for a job. It is a smooth introduction into sales management and how major corporations function.
good,i loved the  experience i had with the store sadly my stay was short lived and would love to return when available. i plan to submit my resume in once again
good,"Family Dollar is a great place to work, you meet a lot of different people.   The team that you work with is small which creates a relaxed and enjoyable working environment"
good,"At Family Dollar, I had an enjoyable experience with other staff and the customer base. There was proper communication, and a willingness to help from everyone."
good,"A typical day at Family Dollar would be lots of smiling, sometimes fast paced, stocking and restocking, cleaning, helping out customers and answering there questions, greeting customers when they come in and when they leave, cash them out and issue out refunds and exchanges and counting out and balancing out the drawers at the end of my shift. The hardest part of the day is having to watch out for theft especially when it gets really busy. And the most enjoyable part of the job is being with great coworkers and happy customers and the regular loyal customers and knowing that you have a nice clean stocked store when customers come in and they compliment on that."
good,"Need new management. Great place to work, great items to choose from. Pretty clean ans organized. Fun holiday items to choose from and great upbeat customers."
good,"•	 detailed oriented"
good,"Great retail company to work for, had some growing pains when they first came to California but now there all shorted out. Internal promotions are big with company."
good,It was a nice work place until they merge with dollar tree and a lot of things started to change such as managment  and hour. I think that they can inprove on how many people that work in a day. There seem to never be enough of cashier on staff.
good,If it wasn't for having gone to school for a different field I would definitely stay at the Family Dollar. I love my job and I love the people I work with.
good,Long hours.. great pay..days off... can be a very good company if you have a staff that will work with you as a team. if you wont a job that's steady an sometimes hard then this is what you need
good,This job was a lot to handle. There were many things that needed to be done at the location in such short amount of time. The most difficult thing to do was trying to keep the store in order but assisting customers as soon as possible.
good,Family dollar is a really fun place to work the big pro with it is they can not keep a store manager there for a long time. the hardest part working there is running everything ur self.
good,I learn the effectivity with which it develops that work can be done and the most enjoyable part of the job is share with my coworkers work while we do our work.
good,It's fun working here and all just want to try something new. Will put my 2 weeks in just in case in the future I can come back. Will miss this place.
good,"Working at Family Dollar was a overall good experience. Although the management staff was short-handed, the people that I did work with and under where pretty easy to work with and understanding of the need for us to pull together and we're able to perform at the high level for the corporation."
good,Productive work place a lot of things to do. Fast paste at times. Good pay and it is every week but they are talking about changing it. Good place to work at if you have the right management
good,"Flexible hours, discounts, great crew members, optional overtime, nice atmosphere. The managers are very respectful and offer overtime to those who want and or need it. Break room very clean and nobody argues or has major issues. I enjoyed my time with the company and recommend it to anyone job seeking."
good,"Family Dollar was my home for 7+ years. They did me well to make sure that when I needed to work around my life schedule, they were more than accommodating. As for difficulty, it would depend on area of work, how much experience you have, and who are your higher-ups. Some are more than wonderful, some are not."
good,"Generally a good place to work. The always seemed to be trying to stay current with trends, product and pricing. They tended not to allow experienced managers to help develop new programs or new ideas from other companies."
good,"I enjoy working with Family Dollar because it's fun I have regular customers I see everyday and they are very nice! Easy to get along with. There's nothing really hard about the job at all, it's pretty simple."
good,You work as a cashier but you will also help restock. Keeping the front end of the store clean and organised is another responsibility. Overall the job is a good first job to have.
good,I have been an employee of Family dollar for two years. I love the company itself. The culture in Atlanta is a lot different from the culture in Maryland although it is the same exact company. The only issue is that they are horrible with a consistent schedule and the district managers in GA are not friendly or helpful at all!!
good,"I enjoyed working at Family Dollar,  it was an easy going work environment that kept you busy and helped the time pass. You learn alot from other employees and gain work experience. I would definitely work there again."
good,The hardest was keeping the thieves out. The job was disorganized but fun. I gain a little more knowledge in time management. Responsibility played a big role as well.
good,"Merchandising, protecting company assets. Register balance, customer service etc. You learn plan-o-grams and diversity. The hardest part of the job is shrink in the toughest areas. The most enjoyable pat of the job is building a Family with your team!"
good,"I would work on freight and run register along with helping the customers leave with the products they needed. I enjoyed meeting new people and learning new perks to the job.Hardest part of the job was there was sometimes to much work for one individual, but I always managed to get my work done."
good,i worked at family dollar for over 2 years and didn't have any major problems.  management were very accommodating with scheduling and training. no problems
good,"Typical day at work"
good,"I actually enjoy it, mainly because of the people I work with and the town locals. My biggest issue is we're not given enough hours for the store to function properly. And if you're part- time like myself you don't get anything."
good,It was a fun place to work when we all work together as a team and we all get along. Its a fast pace. Best days for me is when receive truck day. Unloading the truck and stocking up afterwards the same day or the next day.
good,They were pretty cool concerning my circumstances at the time. But career wise I wouldn't do. Really think they should have paid more and work the hours around to everyone on the schedule
good,"You don't get benefits being a regular customer service rep. Here in Georgia, you only get started with $9.00 an hour. At my specific location, management was good, until someone began throwing around false accusations of stealing merchandise."
good,i my experience working for family dollar was ok i got to meet new people everyday and assisted them with what ever they needed help with I also learned how to be a cashier
good,"working this job is ok, you dont get paid extra for holidays, you CANNOT call off on holidays sick or not, if you were schedueled you had to be there or rightup/termination, the only holidays the store is closed on is christmas, open christmas eve, thanks giving closed 7pm"
good,Family Dollars was my first job working there was to  okay. Each day I unloaded the trucks and stock the selves. Some day we had  big loads and other days we had small loads .
good,I enjoyed working at Family Dollar. The hours were good and I advanced to Assistant Manager fast. The pay wasn't great but tolerable. I didn't need the  medical benefits at the time but it is nice they offer them to employees over 30 hrs a week. I liked the people I worked with very much. Unfortunately the location I was at closed down while I was there.
good,It was ok.. I hate that the opportunity for overtime is non-existent.. you can live off of $8 an hour with only a max of 30 hours a week.. it forces you to work two separate jobs...
good,A typical day working at Family Dollar requires exceptional costumer service skills as well as good verbal communication. You must be able to operate all functions on a cash register. The job can be pretty fast paced at times during certain hours of the day. Management is very good and inventory is well organized. The hardest part could be when the store is really busy and during holidays. What I found to be the most enjoyable aspect was having constant steady work to keep me busy.
good,Only bad thing about working their is I was not full time and I only got 18 hours a week I can not live on that...other then that I love it loved my boss and Co workers
good,"I loved the job, great place to work and good people!! If I didn't leave I would of probably had my own store!! I learned everything I could possibly learn and then some with great teachers, I moved up pretty quickly. I moved to the field to do holiday stock or help stores get ready for inventory... or just help stores in general!! I loved it!!"
good,I enjoyed working for this company. The management was good but it was hard to keep employees that would show up for their shifts. Their weren't consequences for calling off on a regular basis. To afraid to lose people.
good,"Great place to learn the ends and outs of retail management."
good,family dollar is not enough balance and don't have enough workers to preform job duties safety is very risky lines always super long but their hours is very good location near home is good but management can be better
good,"My time at Family Dollar was enjoyable, my manager made sure that we got whatever day we needed off. I was working here while going to school and managing a family. I enjoyed the customers as well. I am glad I had the opportunity to work with the crew I did."
good,You almost always have something to do and not have to search for something to do. Everyone I worked with is friendly and willing to help if you need it. Hours per week are constantly going down or up depending on payroll given to them. If you need fixed hours per week and aren't in a management position this job is not for you. However everything else is fair. I will miss it if I have to leave.
good,"Overall Family Dollar is great for entry-level retail, with fairly flexible hours. Don't expect high pay though, as usually that is up to the manager who hires you (and state hour wage rate). More experience in retail the better you will be received, however it is a great primer for those just getting into retail. It's a variety-type store with a little bit of everything, where customer service is key. If you are looking into management positions there, it is better that if you have already been with the company a decent amount of time, that being said we always are hiring, due to the nature of the job. It can be fast-paced and hectic, but with a good team of coworkers, it balances out."
good,"my personal opinion besides what already answered is not available. I don't have anymore to say about Family Dollar.I hope you understand this."
good,This is a great place to work . You get to interact with different people every day. The. Staff is very helpful and polite. There's always something new in the store.
good,"As a part of management, it was rather easy moving up. Starting as part of the GRAND OPENING team, i'd say I moved up rather quickly.     Good Place!!"
good,"Fast paced enviroment,great staff...never was a dull moment..."
good,Family Dollar was a good job. I just think my location was horrible. It's easy to move up in the company as long as you're doing your job. My manager was amazing.
good,"In between the time of me working for Family Dollar, I got to display my leadership upon my fellow employees, and on hoe to manage day to day situations with customers, check-in's with Vendors, money control, etc. Like any local store you have your busy and non busy days."
good,working here I learned a lot it is very productive and fast paced . there are some stressful things about working here but over all I liked the people I worked with.
good,"The management is good. It's an intensive place to work with lots to do, and even more to learn. The most enjoyable part of my job is talking to customers and getting to know them and what they need."
good,I really enjoy working there with my Employees and managers. I stocked there on mostly truck days. Cleaning the area and most importantly serving customers service needs.
good,It was full not reall any time to goof off. Seeing regulars really made me enjoy it even more because it just felt like everyone was family. Optional breaks was a huge plus.
good,started when the truck showed up unloaded the truck int o separate pallets and carts. then after all of it was separated by aisle took them on the floor and stocked the shelves of the product
good,"The environment is typical work environment. Considering most stores locations and hours, the climate is the same. The people make the job, it is a neighborhood store afterall."
good,"A typical at work is taking care of the customer working hard an delegating task to my employees. Just making good example for my"
good,"This job was a retail job that was steady paced. The environment of this job was a little hectic due to the location of the store. However, management was wonderful and always welcomed me with a warm smile and helped with situations and problems."
good,"Store managers worry too much about the other stores where they could be more focused on the store they run. Put to much blame on assistant and cashiers when they do wrong. This happens a lot.I watched managers become a different person when they were promoted. They should still be team players. The hardest part was double shifts, and getting screamed at by managers.company has a big turn over.I enjoyed the job itself looked forward to coming to work and working with customers was a big deal to me."
good,"The only thing I have to complain about is the hours, but I loved working here. I loved the people I worked with and helping the community. Great place to work."
good,Accounting management were knowledgeable and allow individuals to complete their jobs with helpful guidance when needed.  Monthly deadlines was the hardest part of the job.
good,it was a nice place to work. we were always rushed to do stocking and run the cash register.  I was always offered extra hours at other stores due to my job qualities
good,Family Dollar is a great place to work.  Wanting to move up in the company is no problem.  Management will notice hard work and offer future positions to their employees.
good,"1. Your typical day starts with organization."
good,My day was split between providing customer service to our guests and reducing internal and external theft. I learned and mastered internal policy and procedure and utilizing technology to proactively prevent theft and/or determine if theft had taken place. Management was supportive but was limited on creative approaches versus a highly standardized approach. I was fortunate to work with a great group of people at my store and a fun customer base to interact with. The hardest part of the job was dealing with potentially violent situations and shoplifters who were very aware of the limitations we had in trying to stop theft. The most enjoyable part of the job was providing a high level of customer service followed by reducing theft.
good,"I was the assist manager there, I loved working here, I got to work at my own pace, got along with my co-workers, loved seeing my regular costumers. Always busy with something to do. I quit my job because some of the higher positions have no respect nor do they appreciate the hard work you do. The pay was okay, they could offer more tho for the amount of work the require to be done. If I could go back I would in a heart beat"
good,"document in trucks for shipment and also count down cash registers for start of day, make deposits to bank, maintain and keep clean store, training for new hire employees, hire and recruuit"
good,The head manager had me do much more than everyone else.  People of other races did not have to do as much as i had to do and were told that their work was do correct and good.
good,"Awesome people, great place to work, or for anyone to have as a starter job. Family Dollar provides great training for anyone who's trying to move up."
good,The most Enjoying part of my job that was daily was serving the customer knowing that you are well answering there question demanding to all there task and proving them with great service knowing that they will come back to you
good,"Easy job, pretty laid back environment. The job itself is very simple according to the area that you are in. Some stores have been robbed but I guess that goes with the territory. As long as your crew likes to work you can have fun while at work."
good,"Cashier job duties include run register, greet customers, take payments of types cash debit credit or checks. Stock, straighten, fill, and clean shelves. Mark and enter into system damaged or defective merchandise. Management was good when there was management. They have a. very hard time keeping managers due to the fact that they do not pay enough for what is expect of them and everything they put up with. I love working with the public. The hardest part was getting some much done plus provide good customer service often was either or, but rarely both."
good,Fast paced environment. Definitely not for anyone who is hard of learning so to speak. Store manager is wonderful and will work with you. Her assistant managers could do a lot better and lack a lot of customer service skills that are critical when interacting with customers. Customers should never feel unwelcome or as if you do not value their business which is what some assistant managers treat them as.
good,"I absolutely love the people who work with me, as well as all the customers that come in everyday. We have so many regulars that make our days go so much easier. I also love having the randoms come in it's always nice to see a new face."
good,"Be prepared to work with this company. Overnight shifts are not the regular, but they do happen. It can be a heavy type of job for those who are not ready."
good,i had a great time working at family dollar. the crew i was working with made the job super easy. The only thing bad about the job were the thieves that would come in the store
good,"The work wasn't bad for the wages and it was equally distributed chores, between the assistant manager, manager, and cashier. There was always something to do and it was for the most part a fun place to work."
good,Very good place to work room for advancement comes quickly just need more training when it comes to management. good pay and the family environment is nice
good,"Location I worked at was a great place to work at. Both the coworkers and management, and the customers were nice and just amazing to be around. Issues came up here and there but overall I very much enjoyed working there."
good,"I loved working for this company most times, it was stressful most days but I enjoyed working under pressure. Once I got a great team in place things went smoothly. The hours did become too much but other than that it was a great place to work. I started out as an associate and worked my way to store manager."
good,It's a good place to work for. Team work is always a must. Communication is a big plus because with out that you will not get the job done. Management is good but some can be very rude and unprofessional.
good,"Working at Family Dollar, was a great experience to learn more in retail, and to improve my skills in customer service. the hardest days was the truck days."
good,it was a pretty fair job although the security wasnt always around of course you have your everyday shenanigans like any other job it was a place for someone to fisrt experience with being a cashier and gaining customer service experience and pay was descent
good,"We were understaffed all the time, and worked very long day, but we were like a family. Small and close-knit."
good,The work is not to hard most of the time the hardest part is dealing with some customers. But how you handle the situation determines the outcome of your day.
good,"Working Here HAs A Lot  Of Task too keep You Busy through out the day . Stocking Freight  , cashiering , Keeping A Clean store and been able to work with customers"
good,I liked working at family dollar. There was a work load but we always pulled together as a team and we got the job done. It was nice that they practiced alternating weekends so everyone could have a weekend off
good,The family Dollar was a safe work environment.my duty's were to open and close the store. Manage employee who where working with me.clean stote.stock shelf's.
good,"It's a great place to get your foot in the door and get started. They work around your school schedule, and give you the chance to prove you are responsible. As long as you give it you're best they appreciate you."
good,Working at family dollar comes very easy with my great customer service also my very supporting team. I also have learned also in doing retail and how it works. The managers are very hands on with teaching the things the new hires should know.
good,"Way better place of employment than dollar general worked at both , i actually can say i would go back to family dollar. The district of gastonia with terry as district manager . is a really good distract . their understandable and work with you she hire and promotes really good managers . and the cashiers actually matter"
good,"Worked there for 2 years, wasnt the best place to work, but also was definitely not the worst place to work.  Its a good starter job to get some experience under your belt"
good,"Always stocked neatly,great costumer service always patient  bad area mean costumers ne'er out of items clean store manergers great service hours good weekly pay"
good,Very kind and outgoing co-workers. We made a really good team and all got along just fine with each other. the only downfall was the limited space that we had in our store due to overstocking products.
good,Good place to work lots of people you will soon call regular customers cuz you see them in the store so often lots of good employees you will meet on the way.
good,"Going in I didn't think I would make it but after a while I got the hang of it and all of my coworkers are my friends and there are many people who love me. I've made so many happy enough that they have came back to the store just to see my smile. My coworkers were like my family. It was an absolute pleasure to work with them. A usual day is kinda hectic but fun. It gets pretty busy but it slacks off enough to get your wok done. I learned how to use my personality to the max, how to work the register, and how/where to put freight up at. The management was amazing and the place itself was amazing. There were a few rude people but that's usual at any workplace. The hardest part was working freight when the store was packed out but the best part was most definitely building my relationships with my coworkers"
good,"This company has plenty of growth opportunities."
good,A decent company to work for. Pay is ok for the area we are in. Good at working your schedule for what best suits you. Lots of experience dealing with the public.
good,Its a good atmosphere you meet alot of good people its a goodjob to work on your sales skills the breaks are reasonable and the oay is also good and they work around your schedule
good,Multi tasking is a must in the fast paced daily work. Frequent customers are very friendly and welcoming. There are parents who let children run around. Some customers are rude.
good,"A typical day at work included a lot of business. I learned the point of sale system, how to make returns and exchanges. My customer service skills were improved while I worked here. The hardest part of this job were at times the customers. They could be a lot to deal with sometimes but other customers were wonderful. The most enjoyable part was the crew I was set to work with. We did what we had to do and got everything that need to be finished, done and out the way."
good,"I like working there. "
good,Great job loved the people I worked with. Did not make the money I needed unless I was working 6 days a week which meant I did not see my children that much.
good,the job paid the bills. i was friends with the manager when i got the job. we had a falling out and then i got fired  . there was no hope in a career there for me from managementt.
good,Family Dollar has a wonderful corporate culture.  Its all documented and the training procedures are well rounded. Everything is laid out and has enough flexibility to allow one to be an individual.
good,"Working as a cashier was a good experience here. Stayed busy and management at the family dollar I worked at was great. Co-workers were easy to get along with. Hardest part was remembering tobacco products, easiest part was putting away freight."
good,"easy advancement, friendly co workers, very flexible with scheduling. learned how to make schedule work with payroll lf a sales floor and how to unload the truck door to shelf"
good,"The workday was repetitious and comfortable, my co workers were generous and dependable and the most enjoyable part of my job was the satisfied customers."
good,"I had fun working there. Managers, supervisors, and co workers where very friendly and helpful. A great all around place to work. I hated having to leave there. But could not get back and forth to work when I left warrenburg."
good,Daily duties were steady and repetitive. Management gives you the ability to work as a self-starter.  Non-stressful environment.
good,I really enjoyed working here as a manager and will love to do it again. I had great experience handling the attire and making sure things are going accordingly and hopefully I can a chance to do this again
good,"In a typical day at Family Dollar, we are to stock shelves, clean and sanitize the facility. Protect company assets from thieves. Balance and maintain records from daily transactions and individual cashiers."
good,If your looking for fast past  and high accuracy  this is the job.. Very demanding and speed orientated . Opportunity  to earn more money and decent health  insurance .  Able to cross train and job advancement
good,Great management and advancement but the job can take over your life and it was impossible for be to go to school as a manager.  The crew can be bad or amazing depending on where you at and the are as good as you make them.
good,I really don't agree with some of the management some are unprofessional and not equally fair. Not easy to climb the corporate ladder.and hard work
good,"Facility is a distribution point for local department stores.  The facility would receive shipments that would be sorted, stored, and distributed when needed.  Management was available as needed to answer questions.  Maintaining/meeting production quotas was the hardest part of the job."
good,"FD's culture is built on partnership and politics despite the tasks at hand. Family Dollar culture is also built and driven by perception. Many team leaders have cited that ""perception"" play a big role in the decision making process."
good,I was laid off from Family Dollar after Dollar Tree bought the company.  I did not work long enough with the company after new management and methods were put into place to say how the company currently is.  My ratings are based on my time being under the umbrella of only Family Dollar.
good,overall everything was good good work enviroment i enjoyed working with my co-workers the hardest part of job was the customrs stealing
good,The benefits are nice for full time employees. Paid weekly which is also great. If the upper management in your area is good then you shouldn't have problems. This is still retail so the balance of work and home life is very poor.
good,My typical work day insisted of me filling orders and loading floaters in a timely manner. I learned how to get a lot done in a little bit of time.  I had a good management team. The hardest part of the job was the long hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers.
good,ok job for starters however not for people that have experience and wants more. I did learn more than what I did know with this company. if your a people person this would be a great job for you
good,Everything you have to do here is simple and easy. You sometimes have to deal with rude customers but for the most part everyone is nice. The upper management is horrible.
good,"It was a great company of employees to work with. Amazing with the customers and aiding them. There wasn't much room to advance, however."
good,I love this job and the people I worked with. I got a chance to meet all kind of people. I got a chance to really get yo know our regular customers. If you are  a people person you will love working for family dollar
good,"The work days are productive, you spend your time stocking and taking care of customers. I learned quickly how to do the register and the co-workers were really nice."
good,"The job was enjoyable because of the people I worked with, we were like a family. Upper level management did not care too much about the lower level employees."
good,"My typical day at work is usually a busy one. I manage several construction projects throughout the Southeast. I roll up my sleeves and dive into what I enjoy most doing and that is working with my teams in the field as well as our internal teams: operations and other departments which is vital to our success."
good,Good place to work overall all the tasks are a piece of cake. Nothing that i couldn't handle. I would do it again. I was incharge of recieving and stocking. I love stocking that was my skill there.
good,"had a decent job, the employment was ok, never had any complaints. Absolutely loved working with the elders. Has its times where i didn't want to be there but a lot of jobs do that to you."
good,"Multi Tasking of Duties and Responsibilities Done Daily, Fun Staff to work with. Provided Professional Quality Service Daily to the community."
good,Need something else to expand my work abilities. I am a hard working individual. I never missed work. I loved being a cashier because that's a way to meet new people. There isn't a day some one new did not come into the store.
good,This is a good company. Although there is no security present in the store I still feel safe. Multitasking is very important when working here.
good,"Greeting customers as they they arrive in the store"
good,I really don't have anything nice to say about Family Dollar.  The management team they have in half of these stores don't know how to run a store.  Management treats lower management how ever they want to treat you I know first hand cause I was being treated like that when know one else could hear.  I finally got tired of my boss having bad days and taking it out on me and calling me out of my character by calling a not so good name.  I basically gave my keys up to her and told her she can find someone else to close her store for now one for I was lower management.  I was even robbed and shoved into a shelf and had the wind knocked out of me but I managed to save a lot of the stores assets by slamming my attackers hand in the cash drawer and do you think that company would give me some kind of reward or gift card of some sort.  No all I get is a lot of court papers in the mail reminding me every day of that fatal day that haunts me...
good,Good place to work but I had no life outside of work. Lots of hours. I had to work more hours because the stores were not given enough payroll to run the stores efficiently. I had a great staff.
good,"Overall, this is a decent place to work. First shift is 6am-2:30 pm with a 30 minute lunch around 11am and two 15 minute breaks, one at 8am and another at 1pm. The day often lasts until 3pm or 4pm with some weeks ending early on Friday. This may annoy people wanting to keep their chance of overtime for the week but can be a nice relief for those wanting to start the weekend. "
good,I actually liked working in family dollar regarding the fact i had no breaks or lunch breaks i knew it was because we had like 4 employees and i was the only cashier  but i know i could had at least once been replaced for at least 15 minutes to have lunch. My second manager  in other hand was very nice and would give me a chance to at least eat a meal he helped me in anything i needed help because in the other store i had no training on anything i was just put on the spot regarding it was my first job as a cashier. If i could i would return to family dollar i really liked my job and customers.
good,"My typical work day was ok, but their was too much loss of merchandise due to theft. i worked well with all of my coworkers we all worked together, and everything went well, the hardest was banning someone from the store for theft."
good,I believe if you are looking for a job where a lot of responsibility  and chance to move up in the company are involved then family dollar is the place to work.
good,My first job .....learned a lot from working here  learned responsibility hard working pays off.....meet lots of good people.. good place to work
good,"a typical day consist of preparing food, cleaning and running the cash register. the hardest part of the job was making sure there was enough pizzas made for the day. the managemnt would get busy at times when you would need help."
good,I enjoyed working for this company. The company is one you can grow with. Working for the company has been rewarding. I have learned alot during my time of employment.
good,Good people to work with. Constantly on the go. Taking care of customers and making sure they were happy. Management was easy to deal with.
good,Your always moving around either putting stock out to the floor or working the cash register. You meet fun and interesting people in your day. There's always something you can do throughout your day
good,Was a wonderful job. I love working with people and meeting different people. I love to interact with people as well. Keeping busy is one of my important things.
good,"i loved my job , but was not always agreeable with boss . i liked my job there was always something to do , there was not a time i was not busy . the customer clientele was great they kept us busy as well . i liked working in the public for that reason."
good,It was not a bad company. Loved my boss but in my district they needed more experienced managers. I came from the food industry and I think I got to big headed. I enjoyed working with them and I loved my training manager. He was awesome. They are trying to make improvements and it shows.
good,"Everyday I'm working with customers from cashing them out, to just giving them a helping hand to find something. In any day I could be stocking shelves, moving items around, decorating for the next holiday, or just cleaning up the store. There is always something that could be done. I love working with my team members, we're always working together, constantly laughing and just trying to get the job for that day done the best way we can. With management always trying to cut down on hours and give more tasks some of the tasks do get difficult to complete in time but we always make it."
good,Overall a good place to work but pay is low. Management was really good and the store is very clean. I enjoyed dealing with the customers.
good,"Friendly work place with a busy environment, and great management. Was flexible with school schedules, with hardly any call-outs with such a small store. Enjoyed working alongside my co-workers."
good,There is a lot of traffic at my stores location.  I tend to be on register most of the day greeting and cashing out customers. If (IF) I get a chance I will stock product when I can and at the end of my shift do recovery and help clean up the store.
good,"I love working for Family Dollar they have a good training program for new employees, systems are very easy to use and understand."
good,"I just love the employees and the customers. when you get use to seeing the customer, its something about knowing exactly what they need."
good,They would work with my school schedule which was a big plus for me. They gave me vacation hours for being an assistant. You are able to climb their ladder of success and become more than just a cashier.
good,Nice coworkers with not to demanding job requirements. Easy to work flexible hours with an understanding to employees personal lives.
good,"I liked running the cash registers and learning new things, the down side of the job was some of the customers was rude, but that's how it is working at a job like family dollar."
good,"i love customer service and some customers are actually very nice.the overall experience was good, the stocking of the store and all of my coworkers got along very well."
good,It's a decent place to work depending on the location you are placed in. Quick advancement. Decent managers. Everyone tries to follow policy & if not they are quickly taken off the job. You get paid well for what you do. Hours are easy to pick up & they try to work with your schedule as much as possible.
good,A great place to work in a typical day of work greeting customers helping out my cashiers stocking my store cleaning store running a cash drawer opening and closing store
good,"Responded promptly to investigate and resolve customer inquires and complaints"
good,Very fast paced job that required a lot of work.  Managing a store was very demanding.  I must say again that it is a lot of work but pay was well worth it.
good,"I loved the morning shifts, because I'm a morning person of course. I enjoyed the morning customers. I enjoyed making people smile in the morning, while i was stocking the shelves or help customers check out."
good,"A typical work day included being assigned a register, then a second assignment to do during slower hours. As a part of the Family Dollar team, I learned how crucial it is to work as an entire team in order to operate smoothly. The hardest part of the job was dealing with upset/violent customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know both new and regular customers and helping make their shopping experience at the store a good one."
good,Good place to work. Days go by fast and is a fast paced environment. Moderate red tape and politics such as getting maintenance issues fixed.
good,I believe the hardest part about working at family dollar is having to deal with some ignorant customers and the thieves.
good,"opening store, setting up registers making sure store is presentable and clean. cash draws are exact, closing store and making sure customers and employees are out on time. nightly deposits are done. working with co-workers enjoyable and hard at times."
good,"The job was great, it is perfect for a college student just needing a job to make some extra cash while they take a few hours from studying. You are at the games live court side & u get to see the show, the players, the fans, & famous people, it is just perfect."
good,"My particular manager is a control freak. I was told that I can't use my cell phone at my desk (have to go to ""designated break areas""), but other employees have not been told this by their managers."
good,"nine hour shifts, learned to use a center rider(Forklift), management are okay but are only worried about productivity,, hardest part is finding the products, most enjoyable part is using the center rider"
good,worked as an asst manager advancement was quick worked with good people had good hours and the PAY WAS GOOD. top management wasnt that great
good,"I start my morning off with the pet area putting the merchandise from the truck out on the shelves. I learned how to really multi task, managers are fun and a pleasure to work with."
good,"I learned about ""Sku"" numbers, and took me no time to excel with swift cash handling, with the help on an amazing manager. A typical day would involve me helping customers, stocking product, cleaning store and making daily deposits."
good,I enjoyed this job because I stayed busy.  You have to be a patient person because sometimes the customers are rude and you really need good customer service.
good,I was able to work at a fast pace and i also got the opportunity to meet new faces. Very productive and i was able to improve on my customer service skills as well.
good,"Working at my local family dollar was fun but at the same time it was unprofessional. Employers were coming in when they felt like it, the manager was not really professional. A typical work day would be one or two people at a register and two others in inventory or stock."
good,This employer was fast paced and offered room for advancement. In five years I went from a cashier to store manager. The hardest part of this job was dealing with my store closing.  The best part of the job was the environment.
good,"If I were to open the store I would start by starting up our system, counting the safe, filling out the deposit bag & printing out the paper work from the previous day after I finished I would work on the floor (Stocking,Taking off/ putting up sale tags, Working on damaged items putting them on sale,Payroll etc.) until the time I am scheduled to leave. Closing the store I would pick with what the previous assistant manager was left to finish. At a certain time we would stop and start to clean up the store as we would call ""Recover"" the next step would be to lock the doors when it was time to close and go straight to  I would have to add up the number all of the cashiers sold all together and deposit it into out system and gather all the paper work for the next day. At this job I learned how to manage a store on my own& learned the system inside and out. It was a joy working there I had a great/professional relationship with all my co-workers, it was like a big family there. The hardest part about my job was to work in an unorganized environment. The most enjoyable part of my job was the team work."
good,"Position: Administrative Assistant to a local Regional Vice President"
good,I wouldn't recommend Family Dollar as a place to have a career. Its a wonderful place to get a start on life. Most of the time the coworkers are pretty fun and friendly. Human resources don't really help out with business issues but that just could be my personal experience.
good,"A typical work day consists of the same things everyday. I've learned how a distribution center works and functions on an everyday basis. Overall management is very good, including my Inventory control manager, and my coworkers are fun and great to be around."
good,"Management was great, very helpful. A typical day at work was productive. I was a stocker so it was labor intensive but I didn't mind. I had great co-workers. My job was enjoyable all around. great management and co-workers."
good,I either open or close the store. I am normally the opening manager and I am usually by myself for most of the day. I work very hard to put freight away and ring out customers. I do not feel that my manager knows what she is doing and tends to say other people said this is what we should do instead of saying that is how she wants it. I love my job but I don't feel like we are a team anymore.
good,"Extremely fast paced environment, great workout, only downside would be the cold winters standing inside a semi trailer for hours."
good,"a typical day at family dollar meant we were catching someone shoplifting "
good,"I loved it here. Usually, there was only one cashier and one manager on, so we worked together, when no customers were at the counter, to fix shelves, clean up, recover the merchandise and stock shelves. The people were great and I felt I would have stayed there for a long time."
good,The stor is very busy with many factures causing many dynamic episodes to effect performance of store employee attides and performance. I liked the job.
good,"I liked the diversity in the hours, the opportunity to advance in your career, and the challenges faced on the job"
good,"I started out a sales associate.after only 6weeks i was promoted to assistant manage I learned how to order store supplies,set end caps.also  I learned how to work as a team.all of my coworker got along great.soon i became a manager of my on store.all of the employees had fun times but we also knew when it was time to get serious.I was with the company at a few diffrent stoes for a period of 4 years"
good,"At Family Dollar you have to make it fun based on the work needed to be done. My team and I had team made goals that we wanted to meet daily, weekly, monthly and yearly. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the payroll issues handed down from management. Overall I loved working for the customers."
good,It was a temporary job. I went from store to store reorganizing it with a team of other workers as well. The pay was good seeing as it was an easy job.
good,Everyone in the store helps cart and stock items from truck on delivery day. Everyone was accountable for loss prevention survey. My co-workers were very competitive. The management did not report the roof leak that was pooling in the ceiling tiles until a ceiling tile burst during store hours. The hardest part was mopping the store which I had not done before and everyone was expected to do. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting a paycheck to take home and talking to customers as a cashier.
good,"When I began to work for Family Dollar, I was immediately noticed for my hard work and was promoted to Assistant Manager. Basically the job consisted of unloading trucks, then loading product onto the shelves into the store, as well as cashing customers out at the register. Along with those duties, I would create the cash deposits and bring them to the bank and also get the change for the registers for the day. Inventory and tobacco counts were also part of my management duties. I really enjoyed my position there, but there was a lot of negativity caused by other employees which caused customers to not want to return, but that was easily fixed by being as optimistic and helpful as I myself could be."
good,"Love the people I work with."
good,it depends whether your manager likes you becsause if not they will put you working every holiday and make you close all the time
good,Small Company as far as size with teammates pay rates ok but definetly not paying bills...
good,"busy day at work, i learned the ins and outs of the business, management was alright if they didn't allow their personal life to dictate how they treated the employees, loved all the co-workers...the hardest part was working double shifts and the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to have fun with co-workers while getting our jobs done"
good,"I love the customers and my managers. The job is super fast paced and there's a lot of work. The hardest part of the job is keeping people from stealing with the payroll given, it was almost unfair to me."
good,"alot of things to get done, all task are appointed you are responsible for more than one thing alot of the time."
good,"Family Dollar is a very family oriented company. Along with having great teammates to work with, the customers are what make each day an enjoyable event. I enjoy the experience of each day which includes meeting new people on a daily basis and having the opportunity to help them in a professional way."
good,"A typical day at work is working as a cashier, handling money and working with customers. I am the only cashier that is allowed to do a return without calling a supervisor or the manager, I am also the only cashier that knows how to do any management job. Overall it is a good place to work and I enjoy it very much."
good,I loved this job because I am an animal lover. I got to hang out with all different types of animals everyday and help take care of them. It's an overwhelming amount of joy when you sell someone a pet and see the joy on their face and make their new animals happy with treats and toys.
good,i would clean the store and help the manager manage the store.
good,Great place to learn leadership skills and demand more of yourself. The workload was heavy but with proper teamwork the work was never overbearing.
good,Loved working here wish I was still working there my co workers were great and so was managment

good,"Typical day at work, stocking product everyday! Helping guest when they need help. getting to see your regular customers! Store Manager wants to pick the best for the job! The hardest part is when customers run out on you when they see you are helping another customer."
good,"i would go in for second shift, count down my drawer, login to my register, count down safe before i began my regular work shift"
good,"Generally 2 or 3 employees would complain about each other so I would have to resolve conflicts almost daily.  I was management."
good,"As a Store Manager of Family Dollar your responsibility, foremost, is the the overall efficient and profitable operation of the store, and competent management of store staff. As a Store Manager the consistent offering of Great customer service as well as control and supervision of the sales area is not only expected but rewarded. Responsibilities also included but were not limited to the control of incoming and outgoing merchandise, proper ordering of merchandise, coordinating merchandise activities for sales promotions in the area of merchandise display and pricing.

Assist in maintaining record keeping including payroll, scheduling and cash register deposits/receipts. Assist in weekly ordering of merchandise using cycle counts to ensue in stock representation."
good,"After counting the register, the rest of the day is spent working the register. Minor duties include stocking, cleaning and phone calls. A fairly straightforward job with nice managers and co-workers. The erratic hours diminish an otherwise nice entry level job."
good,"A typical day of work was busy and there was a lot to be done. Unloading the truck ,stock items, and helping customers. I learned that working aside your staff has its rewards when completing an assignment. Great management and co-worker who are well rounded people. The hardest part of my jobs was get the truck unloaded within a short amount of time. But the most enjoyable part about my job was the pay."
good,"Management was not reliable on running the store, but the atmosphere was family friendly and advancement is possible in due time."
good,i learned the concepts of building the store shelvesand how to stock the products on the shelves.
good,"Title says it all, I felt overworked and underpaid but my boss was a really cool guy so it was very enjoyable working here."
good,"A typical day at work involves opening the store, ringing up customers until the CSR comes in, then taking care of the stocking that needs to be done, and lastly once the other ASM OR SM gets in I declare my drawer and go home. I have learned that speed counts. I am a part of the management team. My co-workers are funny, down to earth and fun to be around. The hardest part of the job is getting the freight off the truck when it comes in. The most enjoyable part of the job is stocking the store."
good,"Your day is filled with different tasks which is great because it keeps you busy (time flies). You have specific tasks to do each day and there is a proven structure which works. As a manager you are hands on, you do everything a regular employee would do (cashier/stock/unloading truck) in addition to your managerial duties."
good,Manage the store. Made schedules for my co-wokers. Enjoyed helping customers.
good,very calm place to work. Greet customers as they come in and leave building.
good,"My typical day at work was running register and customer service.  It was a very busy and productive day.  Some days I had to multitask, which I seemed to handle very well!  Also, when we wasn't unloading truck and putting stock out we would recover the store.  Which meant going around section to section pulling items forward, putting things back to where they belonged.  Cleaning, sweeping and mopping floors.  I would have to count drawers down at night and get deposits ready for next morning.  My most enjoyable thing about the job was dealing with the customers.  I made so many friends through out the years.  It really helps to be a people person, friendly, kind, and out going when working in retail.  That's me, just my nature!"
good,dealing with diffident people. co-work was okay but I stayed to myself and nice hours
good,"A typical day at work was sometimes boring depending on how many customers came in that day, or it was fun."
good,i work my up from being store clerk to store manager. i would go to work open the store and work on emptying the stock room. the hardest part of working for family dollar is taking in everything. i enjoy meeting new people and learning hoe to be a manager.
good,"3-9:30P.M"
good,"Everyday in Family dollar is a new experience. I love the costumers that came during my work shift. Some of the costumers were not to pleasant but it nice meeting new people. My manager went hard on me and always kept me busy. I learn many things from him such as how to know what are some people intention when entering the store. I learn how to stock and organize items. Work the cashier and money, also how to work in a fast paste environment.  My co-workers were very friendly and made me feel welcome. The hardest part of working there was when everyone call out and i had to run the store alone. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and also Understanding Costumers behaviors."
good,"Very nice place to work, love working with people. I stayed busy all the time and I love that."
good,"Enjoyed interacting with the customers"

good,"Typical work day review reports that consist of cashier voids, order cancels, refunds, average register transactions, review video camera, call refunds, verify petty cash and deposits send daily payroll numbers to DM review this years sales vs last year sales vs budgeted sales. Depending on what day of the week it is depends on what I have to complete that day. From doing exceptional counts, to cycle counts, to store marks, store ordering, unloading truck, stocking shelves, setting end caps, merchandising etc. I've learned a lot working for Family Dollar how to hire, interview, drug test, train, lead, and follow when needed. I manage around 5 to 8 people at a time depending on if I was training anyone for other stores. My co worker/employees have always been a pleasure to work with. The hardest part of my job is having to unload 1,000 to 1200 cases by myself piece by piece no pallets if your help does not show up or when you schedule yourself to work open to closing and a cashier 11a-closing and they don't show up and you can not contact anyone else so you have by yourself. The most enjoyable part of my job things are always changing and I am always learning something new."
good,"Working at Family Dollar I learned a lot. I've learned how to handle money, deal with the public, and even how to manage a store. At Family Dollar, i worked about 37 hours a week. We had a truck every Monday and Saturday that would have to be put away. We learned to take care of customers as well as put truck away. We always got things done on time. We also had schematics which is just rearranging the shelves, we learned to do truck, schematics, and take care of the customers as well as getting everything we needed done in time. My favorite part about working there was working with the public and getting to know all the regular people that would come in. "
good,"Family Dollar may seem small per store, but with a growing number of stores and promotion opportunities around every corner, everyone works together to ensure the stores operations, stock, and customer service are top notch."

good,Worked for Family Dollare during College year. Great job for a College or High School student.
good,Heavy production on a daily basis. Learned many aspects of distribution management. Managed with a lot of engineered standards and key performance indicators to achieve production efficiency. The hardest part of the job was the long hours. The most enjoyable part was the people and the amount of incentivizing that the company initiated for the employees.
good,first work in retail. i had a nice experience and i learned part of the retail jobs working in this company. it helped me to improve the skills that i didn't know i had. nice co-workers and the management just ok.
good,"Would come in at 7:30am open store. Take any deposits to bank for the day. come back and open store at 8:00. Wait on customers, put up freight, check in venders, check emails, put out stickers of items on sale, count cigarettes, etc. Worked very well with manager. Hardest part was trying to put up stock and wait on customers also untill your help come in. I enjoyed the customers."
good,Great company to work for on a fast track to management. The rest of the team work real hard for their raises but never get one. The employee's go beyond their means to show great customer service to rude disrespful customers who call them out of their name and tries to bring body harm to them. I think we need to reward those who work hard at become better at their jobs.
good,"On a typical day we would be putting stock away, fronting shelves and cleaning. We would also be waiting on customers. I had a great manager and coworkers there."
good,"My typical days was managing a staff of seven, keeping up with inventory. The hardest part of the job was keeping employee's from calling off."

good,"An average day at work was handling customers issuse. Helping customers have an enjoyable shopping experince. Making sure the store was always clean and shelf stocked. Loved my co works it was like a big family, everyone worked together. I would have to say the hardest part of my job was un loading the truck but that wasnt bad because we worked as a team and got the job done."
good,This was a good place overall but all they care about is about gwtting the orders out and not about employees.
good,working in retail you have to be aware open to changes and able to keep up with the chages
good,The company is big on working as a team. I am a team player and really enjoy working with the staff. A typical day on the job consists of recovering shelves and stocking product so that our customers are coming to a clean and fully stocked store. I get to interact with people daily and share a smile. The job helps me learn many new things and gives me the opportunity to strengthen my customer service skills.
good,I enjoyed working with the company. I been there for 3 years. I also learn a lot from working there.
good,I ran the front cash register and stocked shelves with new merchandise. I organized the store and made sure it was ready for inspection when they came. Management was awesome. She understood that life throws you curve balls sometimes and treated everyone fairly. The hardest part of the job was having to quit because of a family crisis. I really enjoyed organizing the store the way I pictured it should be and we always got a great review.
good,"I worked for Family Dollar for only a few months but would be more than happy to go back. The store was a bit too small for the business they do, but staff always made the best of it. Enjoyable place to work."
good,"My days at Family Dollar had a different experience evey day, Not one day that has went by was the same. Workng there has taught me that a job is based on what you make of it. If you don't lke your job you wont be happy."
good,"overall great experience with alot to learn from. typical day consists of greeting customers,ringing them up at the checkout and closing the store at night. my co workers were all great individuals and made me feel as if i worked in a family owned business."
good,Traveling for this company was fun and I enjoyed meeting new people and new cultures
good,"It was a fun place to work,fast and steady,demanding at times but wasn't bad at all,My co-workers were great management was good and the hardest part of the job was unloading the truck on fridays and that wasn't too hard overall great place to work"
good,My typical day at work consist of communicating with customers and stocking the shelvles.I have learn alot with the company making me better with my math skills.My co-workers are so pleasent and they always help me out when needed.There never isn't a hard part of my job that I can't handle.And the most thing I like about my job is the people that comes in the store.
good,"I supervise cashiers, unload truck, deposits, clean, stock, conference calls, organize store, receive stock, greet customers, promote sales, paperwork, keep up with daily computer mail and invoices."
good,This job will not only provide a interesting day in and day out opportunity but it gives a chance in advancement.
good,It was very fun to work with them team players always take lunch on time but they never wanted us to get over time
good,"Cashier. I learned how to run a register.unload the trucks,stock,and keep store neat. mgnt was awesome. We coommunicated and helped each other when needed.nothing Iliked the job because it was working with the public.Meeting different people every day.i like learning new things daily."
good,In working with Family Dollar i was promoted to assistant manager within two months. I really enjoyed the responsibilities that were given to me. I enjoyed everyone one that I worked with and I enjoyed working with the public. I feel that the hardest part of the job was unloading the truck every week. The truck could be carrying over 1000 pieces and it had to be unloaded while running back and forth to the front of the store. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my co-workers and dealin with the customers.
good,"good enviromet, always work to do, great benefits, long hours"
good,I always strive to be better than what i was the day before.  Every day is a challenge within its self. Counting my blessings.  Greatful to have the tools i have to succeed
good,"Family Dollar has lots of good deals an prices. "
good,Always had good clearance deals . made people welcome at all cost . Always had a well maintained store. The co workers were welcoming to new employees and showed tgem the ropes
good,Learned about the products and different types of brands. Managers we're open and helpful. Great with customer service. Need better security. Need better communication.
good,"It is typical retail type work. Hours can be long, pay not really high. If you get with a good team that supports each other, it makes all the difference as with any job."
good,My review of family Dollar is good but their management  needs to tighten up on team work.Also it dangerous at all times with thier being no sercuty guards.Other than that I would say it's a nice career.
good,"overall the work was ok, can be really busy at times especially doing the holiday season. I like the fact the company pays weekly which is a real plus"
good,Good environment to work in. Although at times the people that have been there for years make the new people think that they have to work just as fast if not faster then them which is wrong considering they been doing it for a decade or more. Other then that its a nice place to work. The key is to not get frustrated first few days because you basically do same thing over and over eventually you learn just have to be patient and have a positive mindset
good,Some mangers can be very rude. But some are great and amazing. It's a great place to work. Sometimes they dont get to flexible but they can be. Also decent pay
good,Make sure you motivated dedicated like what you doing hard working like the people that is around you love difficult task also big challenges the most part dedicated to the jobs
good,"The manager at Family Dollar was sometimes a bit rude when it came to giving orders to the employees and explaining situations to the customers. To perform good customer service, learning how to respond to them as professional as possible is the main goal to ensure the store continues to have high service skills."
good,"The pay is roughly what you'd expect from a basic entry level retail job, the work environment was calm and the work was easy. Management was kind and was usually there to help with whatever i needed. Its a good job to start off with."
good,Enjoyed working here and always felt like I was part of a family. Never had any issues really and if their was an unsatisfied customer my manager always handled it professionally
good,"Management easily walked us through what we didn't understand. Family oriented workplace. Never a dull moment. Working in Loss/Prevention showed me that the shrink process is apart of me keeping my job, that would probably be the hardest part of the job."
good,"Pretty much what you would expect working in retail. The stores are smaller than big box stores, so it has some good aspects like you knowing most of your customers and all of your coworkers."
good,The management could improve by the way they go about handling things but yet it was a good learning experience. They were very short staffed and was located in a not so great/safe environment
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with and the duties of the job. Sometimes things got stressfully but always happy to have gained the experience. I’ve learned a lot with my time with the company.
good,My experience was less than satisfactory.  The regular store operation from day to day was less then bearable. There was barely staffing and the security of the store was almost nonexistence.
good,"I was treated with respect, we worked together a lot and managers were very kind and understanding albeit firm.  Managers followed company policy and were able to make people enjoy their job.  Cannot complain speaking for myself."
good,"Depending on who you're working with, you're either going to love working there or dread working there. They have awesome customers who become a regular and become your new friend. They really make you feel like family!"
good,"You are in charge of the register and making sure your customers have a great experience while in your store! You usually work by yourself with the manager in the back working on inventory, so be confident and ready to work by yourself."
good,Family dollar is a great company that I have had the pleasure of working with. I’ve have multiple opportunities with the company that I’ve enjoyed. And the way they run the company is top notch.
good,I enjoyed working at this job. I went through a few different managers but I did love my last two managers. The district manager was a rude lady who was very condescending and she came to the store frequently. The job was very easy and the day went by quickly for the most part.
good,Good hours.  Open to available . Friendly co workers. I wished it was closer to my home. Somedays i had to work there alone . There short on staff but overall good place to work.
good,Plan on working continually and quickly on a daily bases and keep thinking ahead all the time. and weekly you have the same routine and you have to keep a positive attitude.
good,"Started out great, but failed to keep abreast of higher starting pay trend in industry. This resulted in labor shortages which increased with time. HR converted time-off definition from Vacation pay to PTO, resulting in losing 3 weeks pay for me."
good,take care of customer close out the previous day check in the truck every week make sure that it is put away do planagram and signage monthly work with the team suggestive selling and increasing sales
good,Fun and productive atmosphere; very laid back.  Takes care of the team members.  Safety always comes first.  Great work life balance.  Enjoyable management team
good,"It was overall a really good experience...the manager had flipped on us...and talked about others behind their backs... meetings were given out in front of CSRs...childish, it's like babysitting adults"
good,"I have worked at family dollar for a year and i enjoy it. Wish we could get some better employees to work there."
good,I really enjoyed it.. Love seeing my reg. Customers faces. I liked what I do an actually look forward to going to work. It was easy work to me I really enjoy putting a smile on everybody workers n customers faces.
good,It is a company where it costs to have a higher position and the managers demand but do not listen to the needs of the employees and above all they do not solve the needs to provide security of assaults in the stores
good,"I left due to lack of hours, would go back in a heart beat. Thank you boss lady for taking a chance on me when no one else would because I had zero work experience!"
good,"going in open the store do your on-hand counts check emails for the task that needed to be done do price changes stock and take care of the customers"
good,Good Company to work for...awesome benefits...put a lot of focus on employee comforts ....work day varied ...fast paced high stress at times to low stress and easy to manage ...good team members ..easy to talk to and bounce ideas off of...enjoyed the team building and recognition...
good,"Just need more security systems in every store."
good,"customer service"
good,It was a delight working at Family Dollar the employees were awesome the customer were cool. You learned something new everyday while picking up skills you can definitely use at a majority off jobs. The only problem was the area it was located.
good,Love the job. Everyone move so fast and store so short staffed that the company training is poor. The company will not let you staff the store properly.
good,Im lookin for a job from monday to Friday  recently got married and moved to tempe I love to work and can lift up to 50 lb. I worked on warehouses doin labor jobs.
good,The store manager is flexable with your needed time off. Family Dollar makes you feel like part of their family. The corporate offers you the ability to buy stock in the company. ETC...
good,"Doesn't have very structured scheduling...hard to plan appointments, etc when you only get your schedule for the following week on a Thursday of the previous week"
good,"I loved the people and environment. We were a team, like a family. We had one another's back on everything in every way. I would have made it far had I not been sick."
good,Management was great she did not let customers lie on her workers she stood up for us and did the best for Everyone involved without hurting peoples feelings
good,clock in and make sure everyone is there and at scheduled times.  plan on people calling in to work.  Break down the day and assign staff their jobs.  than prepare for evening shift to come in
good,Your bosses are amazing and they help out with whatever you need but the hours you work are very ridiculous. Pay was great customers are amazing Benefits are outstanding
good,Good company to work for if you don't have small children at home. They look for dedicated reliable and responsible adults to work when they are scheduled when they agreed to work.
good,"It was a good place to work. EXCEPT on Mondays. That was truck day and there were no guys to help all of us FEMALES unload and put items on the shelf. "
good,A good starting job you can ask for more ours if needed but I saw no advancement in my career while working at Family Dollar. But I can say that the work experience was worth it.
good,This job was a good learning experience for advancement. I worked my way up to Assistant Manager within three months. Yes I put in lots of hours and lots of training but it was very gratifying to be promoted from within. Working with a small crew made for long days and having to fill in when someone called in or didn't show.
good,I liked working at family dollar because the people customers and employees got along well so that made everyone fill good and enjoyed talking with each other about everyday life.
good,"There were many task at hand, always had something to do. The customers made it easy and enjoyable. There was a lot of stock that needed put up as well as the store needing cleaned and dusted. I counted down my own drawer each night and replaced it with another."
good,"It was a fun work place an I had some good coworkers so yeah I would recommend for someone to work for there.The only bad thing is, is the health care"
good,"Being with this company allowed me to sharpen my management skills. I went from assistant manager to store manager/ supervisor in a matter of month's. The overall management team needs work but, the company does what it can to provide new item's weekly. Great place to find decorations for your home."
good,Great job for people who want a nice work / life balance. Great for college/ high school students. I worked there during my first year of college and loved the flexibility of hours and also the ability to gain more hours as needed.
good,There are some things that can be better with communication. I enjoyed that if there was a promotion available and you were qualified they would consider you.
good,"As a former employee I must say I really enjoyed my time there are Family Dollars. My ex co-workers and management team was very fun,loving, and hard-working people. If I had the chance to return I definitely will."
good,Family Dollar was a nice relaxing job for me really didn’t do much there and time always went by fast I would  recommend anybody that job. I  rearrange the shelves  I stocked
good,"Family dollar distribution was a great job and I wish I was able to relocate but it was alwA nice coming in with everyone, everyone working together to get our daily quote done ASAP. Sometimes management would throw barbecues and host special events for workers."
good,"it's guaranteed a place that you will grow there, a typical work day for me is getting along well my customers, stocking and making sure everything is within its sku."
good,"Family Dollar has a wonderful Job Work and family Life Balance, along with a friendly staff not forgetting  Job Security and place for Advancement."
good,"it was a nice place because it was brand new, even with it being in what most would clasify as a ""bad neighborhood"" it was still a nice place to work at."
good,"Consisted of Customer Service, truck unloading, truck ordering, stocking, facing inventory. Had high demand on lifting, early mornings, and long hours."
good,"Worked there for a year and was super fun. A lot of problems, but it’s a discount outlet, so it is expected. Fast paced and friendly environment. Management fluctuated often."
good,"This was probably the best place to work for to be honest with you. To be honest with you if it wasn't for the fact that my current job i am making way more money and have better benefits id still be working at Family Dollar no problem. Everyone works together so great, its the only retail store that i was to advance in career without being someone's ""favorite"" and in all fairness the benefits themselves weren't the best but if your in management of some sorts (and thats including assistant manager) the benefits weren't the worst either. And the hours are small however they do allow you to work at other stores to make up some extra hours and possibly overtmie as long as the other stores have the hours to give you. So all in all this a good place to work at."
good,i enjoyed working with the employees at Family Dollars Stores. We were like family and we worked together as a team should work. it was a safe and clean environment.
good,"I really liked my job at family dollar its really laid back and the management team is very good they work with you on your schedule "
good,The family dollar is an enjoyable place to work for  The customers were wonderful and the atmosphere Was rewarding. I enjoyed working as part of a team.
good,"great place to work, done my duty and went home. team work was always a plus. my co workers were great we worked as one in a unit. I did not want to leave but my family needed me in another state. I wish there was a warehouse here I could have transfer to"
good,This job requires alot of work but it's also fun. You get to work with customers and be the first to know all up coming discounts going on . You have to work hard to keep your store number one.  It gets hectic sometimes but you deffinetly get use to it.
good,It is a good company to work for. I built great relationships with co-workers.  The HR Dept are team players. The culture has changed through the years of the acquisition with Dollar Tree.  Dollar Tree has supported the banner fairly.
good,Great company overall to work for I had a great experience working with Family Dollar. I received 2 raises in one month during my start with the company.
good,"The corporate location in Matthews, NC  is relocating to Chesapeake, VA.  I have enjoyed my time at Family Dollar, but relocating is not a good option for me."
good,They are a firm believer in internal promotions and see there associates as the future management.... one thing that was hectic was they were not able to keep a stable District  Manager and every district manager would change things for what they thought was for the better good for the company. They did issue raises based off of improvements and growth with the company.
good,Job changed a couple of times and they moved people around a lot.  Offered a pay cut and found a better opportunity.  Able to learn retail business and the business rules for different states.
good,This job is for those who don't have any outside responsibilities. It is sometimes challenging and takes a lot of your time in order to get all that is needed done
good,"You learn so much about retail and how it functions. You meet alot of customers and get to know them. Coworkers are really helpful and bosses want you to enjoy and be happy that you are there working."
good,Slow paced work but fun co workers. First hand relationship with daily customers. Can be creative when building sale displays as well. Real family setting.
good,"In a couple words , it wasnt bad working for family dollar. The days went pretty smooth most of the time and not to many bumps along the work day. Everything was organized with what you needed to work on and finish that day. All in all I enjoyed working for Family Dollar."
good,Growing company with a lot of opportunity. The company stresses internal promotes and provides a lot of growth opportunities for its employees. The company operates in extreme urban and rural areas providing services and employee opportunities where many retailers will not operate.
good,Not best retail stores you can work at. Not professional for experience retail worker. They can pay management little bit more because they do everything like store manager
good,Family dollar was one of my favorite career to work. I learned many things such as cash handling stocking and excellent customer service. I also learn great team work.
good,Family dollar is a very quick pace warehouse. What I did it required me to pick and pack while on a center rider. It’s a very good place to work at if your looking for some nice cash .
good,Only receive one raise a year after you have been there a year.  Manager was great.  Not much of a chance for advancement.  Very friendly customers.  I would recommend working here.
good,this company is ideal if need experience. the long hours and the fact that you have to unload your own freight is a bit much on the average person. If your store does not have enough volume you will really work hard.
good,"I enjoyed my years at Family Dollar but it was hard work and long hours. Everyday was different and I liked that aspect.  I learned a lot as manager on how to deal with the public and have good customer service. Even though it was a tough job, I miss it."
good,"I was responsible for opening or closing store, bank runs, inventory, training, customer satisfaction and complaints, lost prevention, schematics, compliance of procedures and guidelines"
good,"Excellent work environment day in and day out. I am extremely excited that I had a chance to open a brand new store, building everything from ground up. I believe that alone has given me great experience in the management retail field."
good,I enjoyed working for family Dollar. The customers were great. Management at some of the stores could of been better. The DM doesn't listen when you have a problem with management. Great pay and flexible schedule.
good,The enjoyable part of the job was Unloading the truck! it wasn't a task that anyone would want to do. Unless you like moving at a fast pace. Unloading and Sorting at the same time was about the hardest thing of the job.
good,I just want to be able to go into the field I went to school for. I am a hard worker and like customer service. Fast paced environment is a plus. Prompt and realiable as well.
good,Nice people to work for family dollar was purchased by Dollar tree a couple of years ago. the transition has been very smooth and professional. This is a very nice company.
good,"Management has changed hands more than a couple times since i've been their, each new manager had new rules like breaks went from 30 minutes to and hour, schedule changed atleast two or three times a week, and if management doesn't like you they will throw you under such as put you down to work six days and call you in early an hour early or stay an hour late than get mad when you get overtime."
good,I work with family dollar for 3 years and was a great job family and I would recommend other people to apply to work for that company I started a cashier and became assistant manager in a year
good,"I had an amazing experience at Family Dollar I learned how to handle money, how to treat the customers and deal with situations that you don’t get a lot, Family Dollar helped me grow in the working world."
good,The facility in Matthews is full of people that started to work there  when they graduated from high school. It was such a pleasure to se people 35 years old that had been with the company more than 15 - 17 years.
good,The job was fine exciting just not enough pay due to the detail of each job assignment that's all. Vacations good benefits are up to par lots of smiling faces and good character of people to work with.
good,a typical day at work was running around re arranging stores for the district manager. the district manager was a great guy to work for the hardest part of the job was lifting and moving merchandise
good,Had to always catch people stealing but other then that the guatomers was not so rude and they were normals and can in on the regular lots of happy smile warming environment
good,"During my time at Family dollar everything was good for the most part. You do get promoted relatively fast if youre a good worker, but sometimes is manly due to employees leaving or even managers. As a CSR (customer service rep)you will be mostly behind the register taking care of customers and also do some stocking."
good,long days but amazing benefits for the family and yourself. overtime with pay and half for the overtime. they are a place that is a way to get your career started for the rest of your life
good,I enjoyed working at Family Dollar. The work is demanding and I got rewarded for going above expectations. I felt management was fair to employees. I enjoyed the friendly competition with my fellow employees.
good,I learned a lot of customer service at this place. I enjoyed experience new things and the co workers were very friendly and helpful. I got to do more cashiering here and it was amazing.
good,Other than the minimal security I enjoyed working at this store. It had good workplace management and a relaxing environment for co-works and customers.
good,but don't acknowledge people work and manger don't do anything they but it all on the assistant. They not fair to much drama can be stressful when you don't have a team and people doing what they want with no consequence.
good,"Great but hard place to work for, lots of heavy lifting and pulling. I had a great staff and it was easy to advance up. My pay was good as well. I had great customers"
good,A typical day at work was me running around from the cashier to stocking and then at the end of the day counting the money. I learned alot there. The hardest part of the job was going back and forth. The most enjoyable thing was I got to work with the nicest people.
good,"I worked there over summer. The workers were really nice and offered me drinks like soda or water. Although, it was extremely hot and often had to take breaks."
good,This job was very flexible hours and the employees was very awesome people to work with. The job was cashier and stocking and I really enjoyed working here.
good,"This is a cut throat company, either you build a team and win or end up doing everything by yourself  and burning out or getting fired. You learn everything sales, HR issues, loss prevention, and team building. "
good,"I'm an assistant manager for a next generation store that hasn't been opened a year yet, and it's a really great experience, but the store manager seems to have some difficulties handling situations. For instance, I would tell one of the CSRs to do their assigned tasks and they would just shrug at me. It got to the point at which I started telling them I would have to tell the manager about their lack of performance. Upon informing the manager of this lack of performance, he ended up siding with the CSR, stating it's my fault if he/she doesn't do what's assigned to them. I'm sorry, but I'm not about to drag someone and force them to do it. If they don't do it, an RPT (write up) should be issued. Other than that, I would not mind moving up and managing my own store."
good,Family dollar was a great company to work for. The problem mostly is there were never enough hours to allocate to employees so assistant managers like myself would end up working most of the time as we were able to accomplish more tasks on the floor and customer service needs. I would work for them again if given the opportunity as the pay wasn't fantastic but the benefits made it worth it.
good,Family Dollar is one of the best stores to shop at budget wise you have great people there ready to help you in anything you may need help with whether it's funiture or cleaning products
good,"As a Store Manager for 12 years I put in a lot of hours for this company.  Family Dollar requires store managers to work at least 52 hours a week and more to get the job done.  It is a physical job.  You will unload truck, process freight, run cash register and everything in between.  Limited payroll at times to run store efficiently.  Overall, I enjoyed my time as a Store Manager."
good,"I enjoy working as a team and that was one of the most liked jobs I had, because we had all worked so well as a team. Cleanliness was every important. Also enjoyed being around customers."
good,It is a competitive job in which you would have to constantly worry about shrinkage.  In some circumstances you would have to watch other employees as well as customers.
good,It was a ok job and i enjoy meeting new people working there and the hours was good only if we where short handed the mangerment was really good and very good at being helpful
good,Its a very busy retail working constantly as a Supervisor to meet all store deadlines. Only hard working people need to apply to these kind of retail stores.
good,Family Dollar can be a hard job but it can also be enjoyable to someone who is looking to climb the work ladder within the company. Family Dollar is a good job.
good,working at family dollar was great. I lead a lot of skill working their like customer service cleaning helping people skill and interacting with others only wish it wasn't a temp.
good,Good  it wasn't all that it was a job for me when I was in school and now that I'm out family Dollar nut a high for me I hope I get another job but I will always remember that was my first job
good,I enjoyed daily interactions with customers and worked with a great group of people. My questions were always answered and the Manager was accommodating with requested days off as needed.
good,I love family dollar . always something to do never bored   . get to wear a polo and jeans . paid weekly and get to meet all kinds of people everyday.
good,I enjoyed working at family dollar they offer great benefits and you get paid every Friday also you get a break and customers are really nice once you get to know everyone
good,Very Good workplace needs more security hours are great and management  is understanding when dealing with emergencies. Some store do need better management and crew members.
good,Working at family Dollar was a great experience. At first things were rocky as the store was just establishing stability. Now over all the management and staff has the store running smoothly.
good,A typical day was running a cash register and serving the customers in the store. A lot of stocking and checking in merchandise was also involved many days.
good,"I started out as a cashier with Family Dollar and a few months later I was promoted to Assistant Manager. The position had its amazing moments and it also had its challenging moments all at the same time. I would say the hardest part of the job was getting everyone on the same page on what is suppose to do, because there were some that did not want to listen and the most enjoyable part of the job was the friendship and communication skills between the management team."
good,"I loved working at Family Dollar. Only thing i have bad to say is that depending on the neighborhood, there could be some technicalities like thieves which makes inventory and profit decrease. Other than that i love the work environment and customers make my job a whole lot better."
good,They worked well with my availability to work at the time. I worked mornings/start up. Enjoyed customers and coworkers. Good company  to work for. Worked seasonal help.
good,"I took a part-time job there while I was in college and it was okay, I was a hard worker and my manager seen that so I became her right hand guy, even though I was just a cashier, she trusted me more than the assistant manager. It also depends on your location as well, good part time job for students"
good,"Staying busy helping customers, re-stocking. Great manager willing to work with you or around your needs. No hard part working here. Interacting with customers is a great experience."
good,"Working here is nice. But its not a forever job. For the time being it got me my own place & my own car. Recently hours were cut & I need something with a definite 40 hour week schedule. O"
good,"Everyday we looked at new things and how would they benefit, us as a team. And what we could do to make the store more profitable, and a good envireoment to work."
good,Most of the time it was putting up stock on the shelves and ringing up customers there were busy days and non busy days vendors almost everyday overall good
good,Working as a customer service rep at family dollar was a cool experience. I just would have rather worked stock more than being  on the cash register.
good,A day consist of running register. Running freight and making sure shelves are stocked and recovering/ cleaning store. Hardest part of the job is keeping district happy with sales and marketing. The best part of the job is all the people that you meet on a daily basis. Love working with the public.
good,I cant talk for everyone else you have you have to experience it on your own i had a relationship with my coworkers that was buisness n we work together on everything
good,Really fun place to work after school. Management team was great and was always willing to work out schedules whenever possible and head out up from when lines became to long to handle.
good,This job help me learn new skills and how to deal with job experience since it was my first job it was good experience and I liked it . I learned how to deal receiving products off trucks and stocking all product
good,Working there at family dollars was very interesting and productive and having to have a fast pace working with a lot of customers was fun. i felt like i always had something to do and that it was easy to learn.
good,"A typical day would be reviewing camera and end of day paper work for correct closing of store from previous day. Greeting customers ,making sure all safety  policies are performed and minimizing theft"
good,"A typical day is really pretty much just recovering "
good,"I loved the discounts available to employees, especially around the holidays. The all around energy was always positive. If I could, I'd go back but they closed my store and made it into a Dollar Tree. :("
good,if you are a store manager it's tough but worth it. its better for the non-parent or the family of two parents. if you are alone with children its tough
good,"When I was first hired at Family Dollar the store was in poor condition. The Brusly location didn't have a store manger, the store was being ran by assistant managers. Then a new staff came in and the store was then up to Par. Daily assignments were assigned and failure to complete resulted in a write up."
good,It is a good place for someone looking for that very first job.The hours were usually lunch time to 9:30pm. Worked on holidays. The scheduled was off and on. I would not make a career out of it.
good,"good place to work, great benefits, and multiple departments to transfer to.  First and second shift positions 6am to 230 pm and 5pm to 130 am.  Overtime when needed"
good,"Good place to work and learn all aspects of the retail environment, always changing and looking for better products , good marketing, and good salary and benefits"
good,I actually loved this position but the customers though were mostly horrible. there were several occasions they were extremely rude and out of line one even tried to fight me
good,"was able to be promoted within 6 months of working there, the store I worked at was very small so only had one manager two asst. managers and one employee. I was one of the asst. managers and I closed at night. pay wasn't very good but was a slow pace to work and relax did many events together. and was able to work at other family dollars for more hours. sadly the place closed down"
good,"Family Dollar is a fast pace business.  The job is very good, I like having something to do different each day.  I enjoy doing the resets monthly.  I enjoy seeing my customers each day."
good,Family Dollar is a great company and has alot of potential. I truly enjoyed my time there and had it been a better opportunity in the latter days of my employment I would likely still be there.
good,"Its not just up front what you see at Family Dollar, you Unload your own truck orders. its a lot of work but its still fun. Usually small staff but works together well... there is never a shortage of work at this employer"
good,"I enjoyed the work, and with a little hard work and initiative I was afforded three raises in 2 years. The hours were plentiful at first but started to average less as corporate cut the store budget. All in all a fine establishment to work for."
good,"Job required requires some multitasking, pay is very good, requires detail to stock and costumer services and the ability to work at a fast pace to get things done effectively in the allowed time limits"
good,It is usually busy from the time you get there till the time you go home. with many tasks to be completed in a days time. most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction you get to experience dealing with the public
good,"enjoyed working there stayed busy clean environment, stayed busy enjoyed people I worked with. unloaded, trucks, put out merchandise. deal with a lot of different type customers"
good,Great team-player environment. Good training. Knowledgeable and understanding manager. Great benefits and reasonable pay.  Not much for career growth.
good,"whether throwing truck, stocking shelves or, customer service there is always something to do. I was hired as an ASM and was promoted to store manager. I enjoyed working in the family like atmosphere and the opportunity to advance. If Family Dollar had not of sold a bunch of their stores to Dollar Express I fully believe I would be a District Manager by now"
good,"Family dollar was a good place to work and really nice people, the people there like to help others and keep the place clean. Granted the people that come up to you are rude."
good,Management was overworked due to lack of upper management involvement. The team built by the store manager was great compared to the applicants within the city. Poor upper level management and questionable work environment during parts of the year. generous compensation for entry level cashier and ASM.
good,A great job if you are a people person. Tons of advancement opportunities. They throw alot on management but you are often compensated well. Theft can be an issue and you are never alocated enough hours for the assigned projects but other than that... A great job.
good,"I loved working for Family Dollar provided a lot of challenges and the ability to meet new people. Every day was different and new, so where the customers."
good,I enjoyed working in this environment and would not mind working here again. It was a very easy job. My favorite part of the job was interacting with the customers.
good,A typical day consist of providing excellent customer service. Unloading trucks and delivering stock to it's proper location. Stocking the shelves. Taking on any extra duties the manager may as me to do. I set monthly displays and do monthly rests.
good,Some of the stores lack proper upper management making the work environment more stressful on the managers. A good manager and a good team working together are able to push through these failing issues.
good,Family Dollar is a Great job for a Single Person with No Family Great Work Experience Good team Playing Job is Cool and Laid back i loved my location.
good,"fast paced work environment , always something to be done. Makes for a quick and enjoyable work day. You'll get great customer service skills and time management skills"
good,"Family Dollar was a good paying job for the small town I was in. The workers are all friendly and good at thier jobs. The manager was a bit much, she expected to much of the workers."
good,It's a great experience for the retail market but you need to stay busy cause of the lack of employees. But it's a great place to start your career and you can move up if wanting to relocate. It has a high turn over. Some people just don't like to work. So from my experience it's a great place to put your foot in the door and most employees are easy to get along with..
good,"Atypical day at Family Dollar includes opening the store, clocking in, starting the time delayed safe, reading emails from District Manager, looking up the special projects to be done, counting petty cash, going to bank to put in deposit & change order, stocking merchandise that came from the weekly truck, recovery (front & face), reconciling cash register drawer, petty cash, & deposit"
good,it was ok it was a place to work good people a typical day at work was clocking in getting on my register and ringing people up. I would work some time at night it was awesome
good,"Everyday at Family Dollar was different..mostly because of the costumers. But the work ethics stayed the same. And if you were  lucky enough ro have the manager and DM that I hsd the pleasure of working with, just made a littlebetter"
good,"A typical day for would be for me to come in, clock in, begin counting the draw to make sure all numbers are correct in the system and physically, check with the head manager to see if there ae any new sku numbers or products that have to be put out."
good,"always busy and occupied"
good,I enjoy working at family dollar. The job is fairly easy and the customers are great! Just need to have a flexible schedule and a positive attitude. The workers are always fun to get along with.
good,Managed 7 other employees. Taught employees how to be team players. I enjoyed working with different people and helping customers that came in to shop.
good,"Develop excellent customer service and managerial skills while learning all daily aspects of maintaining the store.  Optimal work environment is provided to become an enthusiastic, confident employee with  the ability to work well under pressure. Ability to develop into a reliable, responsible, motivated and detail-oriented employee able to positively adjust to corporate changes."
good,I enjoyed it for being my first job. I would clock in take care of customers and restock the shelfs. Then I would clean around the store then coount my register and clock out. Then go home.
good,I enjoyed staying so busy when the freight truck arrived with so many goodies. I got along well with the people I worked with. Greeting and speaking with the customers was nice.
good,"Cashiering"
good,"The management were very good, and willing to work with all their employees. The average day was fairly easy as far as physical work, with some days (load arrival days especially) could be quite taxing."
good,I work nights and it was fun working with my co workers I worked sunday thru Thursday nights the job is not hard at all. and I love working the holidays and working overtime.
good,FD pays better and offers a little better work-family ratio. Company seems to be concerned about workload of all associates. I like that the freight comes on pallets and most of the time it is presorted. I also appreciated have a mentor manager so that I wouldn't have to call my DM with questions
good,"In order to be in some of these positions, patience and direct contact with the public was required; and I always made sure to put forth a great attitude no matter the circumstances."
good,"A normal day at work would consist of signing into a register cashing out current customers,  sweeping the store, fi-fo perishable items. Face all items appropriately. Wednesday was truck day, which consists of unloading roughly 500 to almost 1000 boxes within 2 hours. Loading most of the U-boat to clear space. Stocking the boxes on the shelves from 5 U-boats is typically 1 hour for one person. The hardest part is keeping  up with the times for the U-boats. The most enjoyable part would have to be, being able to help customers find the item they're looking for within a fashionable amount of time."
good,I have just recently started at this position but have no doubt that i will excel. I have always been successful with customers and bringing in repeat business.
good,Family Dollar was great to work for. The staff and managers was fun and easy to get along with. My direct supervisor was very knowledgeable about the products and policies of Family Dollar.
good,Its a great place to grow throughout a company but the hardest thing is maintaining regular life situations. I've learned a lot growing through this company. Received most of my management skills here. You build a family here and friends. It becomes a lifestyle.
good,"There has been a lot of changes in upper management. Some good and some bad. Running a store at store manager level presents a lot of challenges, the biggest concern is for safety. With tight payroll guide lines it often leads to one person manning a store the majority of the day or the store manager working more than the required 52 hours a week, which makes it difficult to maintain a healthy work/life balance.  I have been robbed and assaulted working for family dollar.  With that being said I have a great team that works for me.  We hussle to get to where we need to be and always strive to go above and beyond for our customers.  Hustle harder with family dollar!"
good,"I looked forward to going to work everyday, working with amazing people. We worked together as family with help from one another without the complaining."
good,"Typical day included daily operations from opening to closing the store for business.  Each day was different.  Information changed daily, so objectives for daily activities were never the same.  Stocking, cleaning, price changes, revisions of marketing and product areas, maintenance, schematic or floor plan changes, and many other aspects within a retail business."
good,I enjoy working in the Family Dollar atmosphere. I get to meet new people on a daily basis. I like the clean and warm store environment. You work with a friendly team of associates.
good,"At Family Dollar, I was a cashier. My primary duties were to check out customers, restocking the shelves and taking in the trucks, as well. It was pretty calm, slow and fun most of the time. It was me and the assistant supervising me as well as providing extra help for customers if needed. We had a very friendly environment. Also, Our manager was cool and extremely good at his job."
good,As a unit the crew is hard working as am i. The company can be better. Just looking to move forward. looking to do better for myself and feel this can help.
good,Family Dollar has its up and down days. We always work as a team so no one is overwhelmed. The company an its management work to give ever one their needs from cashier to store manager. Also being able to connect with the customers a serve them in the most professional manner.
good,People friendly environment makes for a great workplace. Easy to learn the requirements for completing a task. Teamwork makes the conversation better with community
good,The workplace cultural is great and so is the management. They will help you in whatever you may need. The hardest part of the job I would have to say is unloading the truck but it is ok.
good,With dedication and hard work there is no limit to your success in this company. The company prides itself on promoting internally.  This gives it's employees a tremendous chance for advancement.
good,Working for Family Dollar was great for me. My Manager took a chance with me by it being my first job. She prepared me for the work force. She taught my a lot of customer service and just made it useful for me.
good,"When i started with the company this store was a new store. I started going in setting the store fixtures. I was only hired to do store set up. At the end I was asked to stay on as a CSR. After one your I was promoted to asst. mgr. A year after i was promoted to store mgr,I enjoyed working for them."
good,its a great company to work for fun individuals to work with love the job and what i learned from this company just think it should pay a little more then just  12.60 an hour.
good,"They are  flexible with hours . It's a fun upbeat atmosphere.The job itself is very easy to do .They have a great surveillance system to secure employees and customers alike.You get to know a lot of friendly customers.There's always room for advancement.They also have health insurance after ninety days,if one would like.Including a 401k plan,after the ninety days of probationary period.Overall Family Dollar is a growing company and a great team to join"
good,A typical day at Family Dollar will unloading trucks and stocking. filing paperwork as well as using computers. The hardest part of the job was the shoplifters.
good,Goos working there just disagreed with my manager. Coworkers were great. And tge customers were great as well. It was a convient store to work at and had a lot of useful everday essentials.
good,Over all it's a good place to work everyone was helpful in the day to day task very helpful to show and teach what the know would consider working there again
good,"This company is in a rock and a hard spot sometimes. The smaller stores only have budget for a limited amount of employees. As the manager of a store in a small community, I was expected to devote 80% of time to work and only 20% to family. It is very hard to work in an environment with little to no help. If someone called in it was always on me to fix."
good,"I love this job and the people that I work with. The only bad thing is Corporate. They expect the impossible. They cut payroll/hours but give more work to do. It's a breeze if your a cashier but management has a lot on their shoulders. You do your job, plus everyone else's. They give you the minimum hours required for the store to run in payroll but give you double the work. The work and hours don't match up."
good,"i loved it, i didnt like how it was in a bad neighborhood. no security but two people in the store. loved weekly pays, i thought it was every two weeks."
good,"A Typical day at Family Dollar when I open is disarming the alarm, setting up the floor , preparing registers and counting safe as well as reporting cigarette counts to assure paperwork is in check. I review my emails from my management team as well as cooperate to be in the loop on current events.The hardest part of the job is when I have to council employees , but it's part of my day and I approach it with a sense of compassion and to inspire  them to do better next time. The most enjoyable part of my job is diversity which allows me to be creative and a quick thinker to get the task at hand completed.On the nights i am required to close my tasks are to assure registers are counted and ready for the morning, prepare bank deposit for the next day, showroom floor is clean and and shelves are organized, electronics such as computers , fax machines, lights are off for the night then to close and lock to doors and set alarm."
good,"The store I was working at had a lot of theft and loss of merchandise and we were always busy and productive. The management team wasn't very good because they were in and out a lot and didn't like the customers at all. I however, tried my hardest to help every customer that I could and do my job as an assistant manager."
good,"great management and very flexible with life, school, and family matters. wouldn't want any other job that couldn't be flexible with my life career..."
good,"Trash is Trash...If an item is thrown away then it should then considered being trash and available for anyone."
good,"Family Dollar typical days depended on whether the time of year or what day it was.  Mondays were designated specifically for receiving and stocking freight from truck.  All other days was to planograms, setting ad, checking outdates, and facing and fronting the store. I learned how to grow with the company from going  to cashier to assistant manager to store manager. Family dollar was my first main retail job where i got to learn how to do deposit, check in vendors, planograms, payroll, hiring, and firing. The hardest part of the job was unloading truck with a broken foot.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to work with my previous manager as she was able to teach me all the skills i posses today."
good,"Being with this company I learned what my passion was. I loved operating the store and employees on a daily basis. Learning new things and how to operate the store was amazing. I loved the customers and locations. My passion is to see that the store looked amazing to the customers daily and loved helping and talking with them. I seen as anything hard with this job was a challenge and was eager to learn to how to deal with upcoming situations. To open and close the store was a enjoyment to myself. Making the store look amazing with stocked shelves, neat and well taking care of was awesome."
good,I started as a cashier and worked my way to being the general manager within 4 months. When I first took the gm position I had no training and was thrown into the position. I had no assistant. So I worked 7 days a week open to close. It was good when I was still hourly but once the salary kicked in it wasn't worth it. THE regional manager is lazy and refuses to let you make any decisions
good,"Well, for me atleast.I had an issue with the store manager, but in hindsight, I could have easily avoided it. This may not seem like an intensive job, but it can get stressful quickly.  The regional and district managers were as nice as could be while still being strict on store policies. While they can not watch every store at once, they could easily spot the good associates from the bad. All you really need to do from an associates stand point, is run the register, clean your register area, and stock items. Customers were hardly ever an issue, but I have been paid in counterfeit bills. Otherwise, a decent place to work as long as you have a good head on your shoulders."
good,Good company in a different field of work. Gives you office experience at entry level. Hands on working environment and overall good company to work for.
good,This is a great place to work. Great store easy laid back. Employees are good people nice company for fast movement in company

good,"Typically work days are inconsistent some days its extremely busy, some days slow. What i've learned working at FD is you have to be very patient with people. The management is great, my manager is very encouraging and has strong leadership ethics. My co-workers are friendly and hard working. The hardest part of my job is working with the truck because it takes long labor and lots of lifting. The most enjoyable part of my job is repacking. It keeps me busy and actively moving throughout the work day."
good,"Work was fun, everyone tried their best get things. As well as working together as a team. The supervisors tried their best to work, with the peers schedule."
good,"I enjoyed working here. I learned a lot of things like working the register, stocking, cleaing, and putting up clothes on racks, but was fired because mangement said i didn't handle a robery of 2 comforters properly. she said i should have chased after him, but that would be putting my life in danger over comforters; plus i had a long line of customers to check out.."
good,"The worst thing I did was quit. The management was not all that great but it was a good job, I stayed busy and knew what was expected of me."
good,get to work go clock in and count change at registers check the registers. Then once you clock in see if there is any stock that needs to be done and then start checking out your customers.

good,Mondays are delivery days so usually depends on what time the truck come I'll help unload the trucks. My coworkers we all get along so usually we have a good productive day at work. Everyone knows what they need to do so the work gets done. The hardest part of the job is keeping an eye on shoplifters.
good,"Family Dollar is a good work place, that is high maintenance, yet very family oriented.  The location I worked for was fairly well organized, and we got plenty of compliments from customers on how the store had looked from organization to cleanliness.  "

good,I really like the job I do and the people I work with. It cant be tough at time due to being short handed or demand of the customers. I like that there was repeated customers that you got know. The management is overall good and will help in anyway.
good,"A typical day as in assistant manager opening the store, cash handling, dropping deposits. Running the store making sure cashier is doing their job as well as yourself. Greeting customers and meeting their needs. You have to be fast and never really plan anything in a time range. The only thing I don't like are the short breaks. I normally work through mines but will let cashiers take theirs. The new manager we have now is great! My co-workers are great. The most enjoyable part about my job is learning things on my own. I unloaded a truck by myself and I felt great! it was not hard at all."

good,What i learned working for this company is that you have to have a quick and alert sense of humor.You have to be quick on your toes.
good,good company to advance with long term.the work can be exhausting because of the constant switching around which takes some adjusting to.I enjoyed the busier day such as truck delivery days because I have energy to put the freight out quickly and safely.

good,working here taught me so much about diversity. in with the store was located in a rough neighborhood but had very caring giving and interesting people who populated the community
good,A typical day includes opening the store at eight a.m See and meeting new faces everyday. The hardest part was putting the truck out in a timely manner.
good,A typical work day would be coming in counting my drawer by the time I am finished a customer will be standing in front of me I will greet them with a big smile ask them how has their day been and go from there.
good,go in to family dollar count the money in the drawer make sure the amount was correct. the company was fun to work at sometimes it did get crazy but over all the customers adored me
good,I like working for Family Dollar. There is a lot of physical work you put into it. You never get borred there is always something to do. They prepare you with online classes you have to do every month. the pay to begin is not great but you can advance very fast. there is a raise every year. I will like to work for this company again but there is a down side to it you get pay as a starter.
good,Working at Family Dollar you have to be on your toes at all time make sure our servie is a good experment  it is a great place to grow   and meet new people .
good,"A typically day would consist on assisting customers and cleaning the store. Throughout the week we do cycle counts, inventory and stocking merchandise on the shelf."
good,"My first love of working at any company is Customer Service.  Working with the customers and a team to complete the daily duties."
good,The company is a good company its just a little tit with money as far as in its stores. Benefits are GREAT and the pay is good so if you get a Manager you are all set in this company!!!!!!

good,"great customer satisfaction, unload merchandise off trucks, keeping a safe and secure work place. I really enjoy the smiles on the customers face when they're satisfied. I'm not so pleased by the pay I believe non management should get paid more than minimum wage for the amount of work being done daily."
good,"Enjoyable because it allows me to speak and react with the customers. Cash sales, replenishing stock. I work with a good team. I don't enjoy the lack of security for the employees. Throughout my eight year tenure I learned that my patience with people is my strength."

good,Very warm and welcoming; not enough hours; always something to do; made friends easily; very friendly people; very clean
good,retail is a very stressful job and it comes with the territory. 99% of the people are polite and friendly but its that 1% of the customers that makes it stressful. as a assistant manager we have to spend too much time on the register as the payroll is not there to have a cashier all day.
good,"Being challenged, with on going learning, along with instructing others on improving retail skills, is the best experience."
good,I enjoy working with customers and learning about retail. I fun part about working in retail is solving problems far as merchandise returns and learning how to close out cash register accounts at the end of the day.

The most enjoyable part of my job are the customers that come in and appreciate the work we have done to the store to keep it nice and clean. My co-workers are very hard workers, just a little inexperienced in retail sales.  I look forward to working more with the district manager to be able to be the store manager of my own store."
good,"My days at work were fine. I enjoyed management and my fellow teammates company. I learned how to deal with rude customers in a calm and polite manners. The hardest part of the job was dealing with unpleasant customers, it makes you feel like you've done something wrong, but I was taught how to approach and solve that matter. I'm not sure what the most enjoyable part of my job was, because it was all around a pleasant work environment."
good,"average day, not much to learn in a grocery store, management was great,once in a while there was that one co-worker i didn't get a long with, it was only tough when i didn't have enough hours to do much job, the company was very flexible and i love working in grocery, wish the company never closed down"

I've learned how to become a team leader with Family Dollar. my management and Co workers worked together as a team to get tasks done. There is no difficult with the position, I enjoyed getting up coming to work making my community better."
good,"I enjoy working for Family Dollar, but I don't get enough hours and I don't agree that they only give Christmas bonuses to those who have worked at least 6 months.  I work very hard, much harder than some of my co-workers who have been there longer and I feel I should be appreciated just the same.  I am currently looking for a second part-time job because I am not getting enough hours at Family Dollar."
good,Nice place of employment friendly staff well organized. They have many opportunities of advancement.

good,"There are times that it can be a fun place to work, however sometimes there are bad days; as there are bad days in any job. I always have a smile on my face, and I am always greeting customers. The hardest part about the job is unloading the truck that comes in every Friday. It is hard because personally I am not quite strong as some of the employees and some of the boxes can be heavy. My co-workers are awesome, and make me laugh, and I believe having a great team is a perk about this job. The managers are flexible, and are not always breathing down your neck, as long as you are doing what you are suppose to do. If you're going to be lazy, it is simple, this job isn't for you. If I'm not on the register then I am on the floor, organizing and putting away store items. "
good,"The people I worked with for the short amount of time it took to open up the store were very accompanying. the co-workers, staff, and manager were very friendly and a joy to be around."
good,"A typical day would me doing cash transactions, assisting customers with their shopping needs, organizing the store to a desirable appearance to make the shoppers shopping easier and worth while.

good,"Assistants and managers get paid vacations and benefits like health insurance. Working as a regular crew person or cashier (depending on manager) may not get many hours. The positions usually start at minimum wage. If an employee shows up when they are scheduled does not always call out and works when they are there, they do give raises."
good,"Make schedules, unload truck, hire new people, stock merchandise, make deposits"
good,"Process invoices, call stores to make sure they received their shipment. The hardest part of the job was not knowing where the store inventory was. The most enjoyable part was interacting with co-workers."
good,It was a fun place at the time. Consistently busy on a daily basis. Get some dead times here and there. Learned how to do the register for the first time that was interesting. Ended up working by myself once for 16 hours open to close. I admit it was a little creepy.

good,as i count my drawer i greet customers as they walk in .most of the time i would have discussions with the customers as i rang them up found it help me throughout my day to stay alert and active.we try to keep a smile and if we see an employee looking unhappy we ask them questions about their personally life right now.I enjoyed the customers the most every one had a different personality that helped me with my people skills.
good,I liked working at family dollar because I was always doing something I always had a job to do. the only problem I had was the store was not organize the management wasn't telling us our jobs we just decided to do ill jobs on our own.
good,The store stays busy so there is always a lot of work to do. The co-workers are very nice and help is there whenever you need it from your peers. Very flexible hours.

good,"I typical work day started at seven pm. All the of the co-workers were very helpful with any question you needed answered. Also, always willing to work.

Some nights you get out early then your scheduled time, then other night you get out way past the schedule time."
good,"•	Load and unload materials into warehouse and into storage areas"
good,"I started out as a Field Specialist going around and remodeling stores with a team & I absolutely adored it. Everyone was nice, we all got along & we did all of our work and then some before deadlines. It was nice to be specially recognized for your hard work. Then I was put into a store which wasn't bad. I was trained, I learned immediately how to do stuff and within three months I was training to be a MOD. My co-workers were okay when they weren't fighting with each others - the guys anyway.

good,family dollar is cool alot is expected of you to be starting out with 7.25 though
good,I enjoyed working for Family Dollar or I would not have worked for the company for as long as I have. We were always having to take online classes to up date us on our policies and procedures.  I also got to know many of the customers over the years who became more like family than customers.

good,"A typical day at work consisted of customer satisfaction. I maintained friendly and professional customer interaction within the 5 plus years in retail. Unloading, loading, and stocking freight were some of the hands on projects I enjoyed most at family dollar.   Managing a staff of 8 to 10 individuals at a time was challeging in the beginning but I learned to gain team leadership and take control. My co-workers were great we were more than just employees at family dollar, we were a Team and without them I wouldn""t have accomplished as much as I have with the company."
good,"There's always something to do."

Also Family dollar itself is a place where all associates have good relations with each other. Our managers are so cool and always ready to answer questions from associates and they are very easy to relate to. Since i worked at Familly Dollar i have acquired more skills on providing customer needs and putting them first and our management is quite organized. There's not much hard things that could be bothering but rather fun."
good,"In a typical day developing the store, it takes a lot of energy to do a days work of lifting, pulling, and pushing objects. I've learned additional values of teamwork and also learned how to push myself harder to get the work done. My co-workers were ""okay' to work with. They weren't the best and they weren't the worst, but that've never stopped me from working hard and being a team player. The hardest part of the job for me, personally, was taking breaks. I don't like taking breaks because it slows me down a little - for i am a hard-worker. The most enjoyable part of the job was finding a co-worker I have in  common with and talk to, making the job less harder than it is."

good,I loved the fact of interacting with the customers and having the items that they were looking for.My immediate manager was very nice and a pleasure to work for. My co-workers were a pleasure to work with we all got along very well. The hardest part of the job was when the shoplifters and robbers came in with no security to protect the employees. The most enjoyable was the smile on a customers face when they were on their way out.
good,"I enjoyed learning how to operate a store and meeting new people. The customers made me want to come to work daily. I enjoyed setting schematics in the store and having a clean and safe environment for the customers and the employees. Management is a challenging job when you don't have the right people working with you for that common goal, which is the success of the store. I learned that it takes great dedication in order to grow within a company. I had a few so-workers that were on the same page with me as for as obtaining progress in the work place. The hardest part of the job was keeping valuabe workers. Some people are there just to make money. I enjoyed the customers coming in telling how much the store had changed under my supervision and I made them want to come to the store more often. I like challenges in life and I try my best to do my best at any task that I am given."

good,My typical day at work begins with either opening the store or with stocking depending on the day of the week. It is very demaning being a customer service representative for Family Dollar Stores.

I learned everything from cashiering to recovery to diffrent procedures to tag making to designs. Management was great to me and was very patient and helpful. My co-workers helped with anything i didnt know and as it went on i was able to teach new employees. The hardest part of the job was picking up some of the heavier boxes. And my most enjoyable was cashiering."
good,Typical days consist of freight pick up
good,"open or close store, front an face, ring customers out with what they buy,put stock out,"
good,If you want to make a career you can here work hard and you get noticed. Hours vary for cashiers but in management you will get anywhere from 36-40 hours a week. Store managers work 52+
good,I had a wonderful time serving costumers and pleasing them as of helping them find what was needed. I have very good people skills so my job came easy.
good,"Loved working for this company.  Excellent benefits. great training,  opportunity for advancement and grow with the company. Excellent salary,  great environment. fun place to work"
good,"It was a good job , the people were very respectful overall. I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone who have a problem with greeting or helping others . If you have a joyful , happy soul it would be a good job for you despite the work you have to do some days you come in , it’s a very laid back easy job"
good,There's always the chance to move up on this company. They are respectful and there th listen. The work was satisfing and rewarding in its own way. Respect of others as well as ones self is highly appreciated in this company.
good,Great place to work . Employees are always willing to help you. I wasn’t there but two weeks setting up the store and did some cashiering. I learned a few new things while there.
good,My review about family dollar was really fun. Great people to work and customers are really friendly. It's a great environment to meet new people. We were very business a whole lot. The hardest part about working was the line would get really long and dealing with rude customers at time but other than that it was really good
good,"I would have chosen to stay at this job if possible, but there was a pest control problem so it had to be temporarily closed. I cant sit and wait months for it to reopen, i need a job NOW!"
good,"Management can improve in certain areas. "
good,company is owned by dollar tree now  lots of changes  in company fun place to work in easy to move up in company  if your dedicated to a good work ethic  great place to grow
good,"All together, I like working in the distribution center. My supervisor was a friendly person, who encouraged me every chance she got. My co worker were friendly as well, and the ones who'd worked there longer than me gave quite a few tips when I needed. Honestly the only reason I'm not still working there is because it's a fast paced environment, and it's not for everyone. AMD I just wasn't fast enough to remain a reliable asset. But anyone who likes a fast paced and friendly environment,i believe will very mutch enjoy working hear."
good,Family dollar was an overall good experience and they paid good. The atmosphere was unprofessional but they had good management and it was fairly close to my residence
good,I love the customer service part of the job and the store is clean and well stocked..we take pride in our appearance .Somedays we get so busy I might forget to do major stocking or smiling at customers
good,good place to work good work environment flexible hours i just liked the people i worked with once u get to know people at any job and how they work everything will work out
good,"A typical day at Family dollar is having to stock merchandise, help customers, show great customer service, and making sure the environment is safe and clean. Being a manager I have learned great leadership."
good,"great co workers to work with and a nice environment, fun place to work and I enjoyed being on my feet everyday, meeting different people everyday and helping them"
good,"Nothing to report. No compliants, good job. Job provides good environment to continue to remain employed. Family Dollar. I would recommend anyone to apply for employment."
good,"Do your job, remain professional and reliable and it will get you higher up the ladder.  Customer service is a must, suggestive selling helps your review significantly and as long as you aren't calling off frequently the job is secured."
good,"I have been working at family Dollar for the past five years it is a great place to work.  You meet lots of new people, they are very friendly family orientated,  The pay is fair I would say I would work for family Dollar again"
good,"Typical works days are great"
good,"In this position I would run a cash register, stock shelves, help customers, and I would also help unload trucks as they would come in. The managers were kind and caring to customers and employees."
good,"As a retail store manager my responsibility was to ensure the store ran efficiently. This was done by teaching and training successful team members, assigning specific duties, monitoring the financial performance of the store and directly interacting with customers to ensure their satisfaction."
good,"Pretty good experience , great company. Great place to start for a first time job. Or if you wanted to make it a career. They just need to pay more and they would be great."
good,They pay is fair for the job just as a store manager you don't get a lot of free tjme. You are always on call 24/7. But you don't have to work many night so that is a plus
good,I love to work a hard working man  did everything my boss told me too came to work on time sometimes early I ain’t have no problems with nobody got along with everyone
good,"Good job, should pay more hourly, company shirts should be provided for all employees. Two cashiers and a manager should work every shift.Other than that, the job Is decent."
good,FDS was like a true family. A place you were happy to call home.A company you were happy to work for and to tell everyone about.A company going to soon from Charlotte
good,the store is now closed but when working there it was slow and you did a lot of stocking and not much of other stuff . bosses didnt want to do their job and would have cashiers do it for them .
good,Overall family Dollar was a great working experience. It definitely had it's challenges and kept me busy.  My day consisted of outstanding customer service and my ability to maintain a clean and shoppable working environment. One of the best parts of the job was being that romodel for my employees and their development.
good,working at family dollars its wasn't a place about competing with one another. It was all about love and being a family helping each other out and looking out giving a helping hand
good,"Liked the job and made quota consistently. Was at the end of the shift when the line suddenly goes real fast!!!"
good,Family Dollar was a very fun job. Required much energy as the labor budget was few. I loved hiring my staff and developing them and watching them grow and get their own stores.
good,In my opinion Family Dollar could be a great environment to foster. You have to create and build your team and place them in a position for success. I agree with many that the company has payroll constraints which at times can hinder productivity but communicate with leadership and at times they are willing to assist you!
good,"We love family dollar.  They have great customer service , and work well together as a team. I enjoy working there with my fellow coworkers. I would definitely refer someone ."
good,I like working retail it allows me to meet new people everyday. Also putting smiles on there faces. Having  great customer service it's the key. Like seeing them come back
good,My overall experience was pretty good I enjoyed working there I enjoyed who I work with I love my managers I love the employees everything was great they were very understanding they were very sympathetic also they were very businesslike and that's what I like
good,It’s not hard to move up in the position in the company because of the high turnover rate the customers were friendly and I was comfortable with my hours.
good,"I loved working with other Associates and Employees, always great. Being able to make customers happy and have them keep returning was very satisfying."
good,"As a cashier in most cases you were dealing with a lot of transactions at one time. scanning purchased items, bagging items and receiving cash and returning change, while greeting people as they walked in and asking them to leave there bags at the front counter and also watching for people stealing. as a stock clerk stock shelves, keep store neat and clean as possible  and watch for people stealing"
good,I had a great time working for family dolllar...i had great co-workers....i miss my friends....we the crew  all got a long well...those were good times...im thank full for the opportunities...
good,"It wasn’t very difficult to keep up with things. I didn’t have many hours and they only needed me for the Christmas season, but it was a good start for my first job."
good,typical day is come in clock in and count your register make sure the amount is correct. make sure work area is clean and presentable. hardest part is when there are a lot of customers.
good,"Really good place to work at. The people are nice , there’s great atmosphere, very helping when in need of help or even when someone sees you struggling."
good,"Great Costumer Services"
good,I don’t mind the work itself but there are constant budget cuts to payroll. Hourly associates get cut but salary workers are required to work to fill in all holes. This leaves the cashiers upset because they don’t make enough to live and managers are upset because they are working over 60 hours a week and have no personal life.
good,"very friendly niece working eenviroment, my costumers loved me, the staff worked as a team, flexable hours, clean store, close to home , above coustomer service"
good,"Working in retail was a true learning experience, not to mention memorable, I got insight into one to one customer service. I learned many different ways to deal with customers in a positive way and to avoid verbal discussions and learned how to maneuver my way through angry customers and found reasonable solutions to help our clients in the most comprehensive way."
good,It was a good job I only left because I moved and it was to far of a drive everyday it was a great job other than that I would recommend this job to anyone who needs good part time job
good,Great place to work. Coworkers are like extended family. Teamwork is awesome. And they value your family life! If you work hard and are dedicated there is always room for advancement.
good,Very fast paced environment with great benefits.  Company has alot to offer as far as learning retail and development.  Always opportunities for growth and moving to the next level.
good,It was a fun safe environment to work at. I learned a lot of cashier skills and how to deal with customers. The bosses were super nice and worked with me.
good,The employees & management both made it it great place to work. Very few stress factors. The work was very simple especially when we were working in a group.
good,I like family Dollar they nice people there good hours not stressful at all hardworking good partners ship goods  management good environment I like it
good,My experience at family Dollars was great overall because I learned new things new people and how to become a better worker holding that stocker position . The hardest part about the stocker position was receiving when it was time to unload the truck .The most enjoyable part of the job was when I stocked & greeting the customers.
good,"It is a good workplace. however, it can be better if they allow more time to each store in the payroll. The hardest is when a manager have payroll issue. He may be alone in the store for several hours."
good,It was ok working there for the time being and i really liked the job but they wasn’t giving me hours and i had to lift for the job and i have to lift for this job so i think that this will be a perfect match
good,":Learning how to stock. "
good,"Very face paced, not only with customer traffic but also with work load.  Time management is very important.  Co managers are typically very supportive, and there's a teamwork atmosphere, which is very important to succeed."
good,"Busy environment, the management keeps you informed about what you are supposed to be doing while on the clock. The environment is friendly, and likes to talk with each other. There is a lot of cash handling while being the cashier. As well as repetitive shelf stocking."
good,I had a great manager when I was there he taught me a lot and was always willing to give a help and hand with anything needed he also did what ever it took to make sure we all finished the work as a team
good,"Family Dollar was a ok place to work at, it helped me out with my bills, I wouldn’t recommend anyone to get this job unless necessary I was robbed at the store I was at. I honestly believe they don’t care about you."
good,"the work was pretty simple, it was easy to work with ,it was easy to learn, very flexible hours , enjoyed the people management was easy to talk to about problems"
good,"Family Dollar was Great, unfortunately the company that I was with wasn't quite so great. I finished the Project on time although I can't say how the budget turned out for the General Contractor."
good,"The people who work here are like family. However, procedures that should be followed aren't in some stores and it bugs me. back stock because inventory is off is out of hand at the Luxemburg store. sometimes drawers are off because counting of drawers aren't done. The store is absolutely cluttered. There is no room for anything.Working for family dollar is great, I just wish they would be more careful in who they select in store managers and watch store managers more closely when they aren't doing their jobs.  It's a lot of responsibility to take on, but that's why the job description is clear."
good,Family Dollar was a really big deal for me. It was my first time in retail so I really had to adjust. It was a good experience for me to learn about it and to take my customer service skills to the next level. You meet a lot of rude customers here and there but you have to be able to keep your composure and that's something I was very good at. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone looking to make a living but as a start in retail just to kind of get your feet wet is a good first step in the working world.
good,I was apart of a store assembly team. Hours were set 8 am to 5 pm. Weekly pay is always a plus but management was very unprofessional and nonproductive in my store.
good,"I had a stable job duty and a flexible schedule. It was calm workflow except on busy days. But there was nothing we couldn't handle. The main duty I had at Family Dollar was being the cashier, like Mcdonalds, which is why I would say any job involving customer service, cash handling, or taking orders would not be a problem for me."
good,"Family Dollar is a good company to work for. It has great benefits including: health insurance, 401k, employee stock purchase plan, vision, dental...."
good,As orderfiller was on my feet throughout the shift and production was a priority. Safety was also high encouraged. I wore a headset to call off orders.
good,"I worked as a store Assistant Manager. For an associate there, the pace was constant, but not overwhelming. If you are willing to help at other other locations there are plenty of hours. My experience the over all management at the different locations was efficient, but the stores were understaffed. The pay was decent for the my area. Benefits ere not offered, unless you worked full time."
good,i liked working here. the place was a little crazy at times. the customers were the best i ever had. the customers were the only reason i would go back to work the next day
good,"I like the environment everyone gets along with each other.  Management makes you feel like you are important.  The hours have been great for me, since I have not had to work later than 4pm.  I feel that I have learned more about stocking and what there procedures are to make sure items are place appropriately.  I also like that each store I have been at they are beginning to have the same look."
good,"As an employee at Family Dollar, I did different job titles, such as cashier, stock, and inventory. Working at Family Dollar i learned how to deal with difficult people in a professional manner. The job wasn't hard at all. I enjoyed always being busy and completing the companies tasks in a timely professional manner."
good,"I helped open the distribution center in Ashley.  Work was a lot of fun and very competitive to achieve a piece rate bonus each week.  Rate become unobtainable, hours decline, benefits became expensive(they are free now), and my last manager was a joke."
good,It was a nice place to work with friendly coworkers! Very easygoing environment. Only downside is I actually wish I had more to do. I found myself fixing shelves they didn’t even need to be fixed. I had to find things to do a lot.
good,"Working at family dollar help me to pro my customer service skills, to take on more and challenging job positions. To better myself at managing others. To believe in myself that whatever I do it is possible to become the best."
good,"I was a cashier and unloading trucks and stocking helping customers cleaning the store, closing up the store counting the money to make sure its right"
good,"very relaxed workplace, great training class and teachers"
good,It was a good job they just didn't have the best manager at the time. She showed a lot of favoritism towards the people she brought from her previous store.
good,It’s very challenging an you have to stay on top of your work at all times we all work as a team it’s a very busy workplace it’s a good environment great people friendly
good,"Great company will help you grow your skills, easy to work and develop confidence in self. They are willing to help you expand in all areas that youe desire."
good,Review about this job would be that we did our best in always providing the best customer service and experience as well as training and educated customers about the stores new items to incite excitement.
good,"Great management depending on location! I enjoyed the district manager at that time also. Always something to do whether it was stocking , running the register, cleaning, paperwork,etc"
good,It wasn't that bad of a job I enjoyed myself all I had to do was keep track of the cash get up everyday keep track of the food make sure it's all put away and how about the customers I needed help and treat people and you know all that
good,"Its a good job to get experience from being a first job,  you move up pretty quickly. I was a cashier for a few months and got  assistant  manager spot soon after"
good,"It was an average job. decent pay, fun environment with my co workers. only thing is sometimes the customers could be a little rude but you learn to deal with that working in retail."
good,The company was very helpful and friendly. If you had an issue in your store you will just need to call the home office and it will be settled by the morning.
good,Some days are slow and others are really fast. must stay alert people will try to steal when store is very busy. And it is easy to stay busy shelves can be restocked or organized.
good,"Active walking all the time, putting items on shelves also making sure the customers are greeted when entering. Also they are pretty well about hours and make sure that the things you do get done correctly."
good,It was a good job when you were left to do your job.  I also like that they promoted from within most times.  The biggest negatives lack of support and little outside help.
good,Family dollar is great to work for as long as you have the right team.  You need people to care about customer service. You need smiling faces everyday.
good,"I was able to move from cashier to assistant manager in just a few months, They want to believe in their internal employees and with that I was able to grow as a manager."
good,Work hard work together do what u suppose to do an make sure everything clean an the right spot.if customers need help..help them make sure nothing ain't on the grown
good,This company treats and assistant manager like a key holder in some instances. This is a great launchpad for people who want to get accumulated to management. This job has its downsides but this helps prepare you for jobs that have larger management roles.
good,"Hard and stressful job, but if you stick through it you can make some good money, this job does provide you with benefits such as medical, dental, and vision, as well as extra pay for working harder"
good,I enjoyed working for the company because of the environment. It was remarkable. I learned that you can provide a customer with great service just by giving them a great experience.
good,"The most enjoyable worked there is the Customer Service, and to assisted all Customers of the Community. The hardest part of the job was the upload the merchandise of the Truck."
good,I love my job so much it keeps my mind off a lot of things the customer are nice and friendly  I like dealing with lots of things and I learn a lot with working there
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time there. I started out as a cashier and went to Management.  Worked well with others, all cashiers and Mangers.  It's hard work but, very enjoyable too. Fast paced environment."
good,"I love working for this retailer and have worked in a number of my local stores (within 4 cities as we are a small area), enjoying every moment of it. Out of the 6 store managers I have worked with all but one have been exceptional!!! Family Dollar dedicates itself as a whole to providing excellent customer service, a clean store and an overall enjoyable shopping experience or at least myself and those I have worked with in my area. "
good,"Great job for a par time cashier. If you want to move up, you have to move up the chain into management to get the better pay and benefits. Other than that there are no benefits as a part time cashier"
good,Great work environment. Supervisor was very knowledgeable and had no issue assisting when needed. Very good trainers and the customer service was always great.
good,"Good Employees and good customers. typical work day is doing inventory stocking shelves , unloading trucks and working registers."
good,Since I been working at this job all I know I gotta do is work hard and get the done. It's really easy because all you doing stocking shields and ringing the people up.
good,I was assistant store manager job easy once you learned the ropes customer service is a must and money transaction had to be on point monitor 8 employees
good,always worked with my schedule. and great pay. great people to work with and move up in the company. opportunity for anyone willing to put in the work.
good,"It was a decent work experience. Especially for temporary work. The managers were great to work with, the fellow staff were fun, and it was an overall great time."
good,nice place to work as a part time job time goes by fast if your working stocking the shelves is easy and allows you to learn the store the hardest thing I say will be on truck day
good,"Overall, the management throughout was excellent, always there to listen to issues not just in the warehouse, but in your life. Management would also come out and help us whenever the quota for the night was particularly heavy, and would even turn it into a competition to see who could perform the best during a set amount of time, while still maintaining accuracy and integrity."
good,Good at counting money good at working with my coworkers was on time didn’t have a Transportation at that time so I didn’t have a transportation at that time but now I do
good,"A typical day at work includes interacting with customers on a one on one basis, handling money, stocking, and setting up seasonal and promotional items in a timely manner."
good,We dressed in uniform everyday. There was something to do most of the time. Customer service was a big part of the job. Team work help get things completed faster.
good,I would have kept my job but had to relocate and was unable to transfer my position within the company. If I could have transferred I would have stayed with the company and tried to job the management training program for advancement.

good,"Its a good job if you want to be an assistant or manager because the pay is good, But it is good to be a student or someone who does not have much responsibility."

good,The Work Environment Was Great. The Staff Members Were Easy To Get Along With And i Liked The Customer Service. Do To Great Management I Was Able To Gain More Work Experience.
good,"My boss was very flexible with hours. "
good,"would rfer this job place to anyone. good benefits, good atmosphere. fast paced job. worked second shift hours. never had to worry about not receiving full paycheck or weekly hours."
good,"Check out customers, answer questions and assist customers if they need help. At the end of the day, stocked product from the backroom and front faced the products that were on the shelves."
good,"Overall a decent job. I was a cashier, met a lot of people. I learned to be more patient. The hardest part was trying to put up stock when we were busy."
good,"I enjoyed working here; I do regret the position turned out to be temporary only.The environment was friendly, new store was clean and organized-ready for the grand opening when our assignment was over with."

good,"Family Dollar was one of the best jobs I ever had as far as scheduling. I was a college student and they were very flexible around school. Anytime my school schedule changed, they would give me whatever hours I needed. For the most part, my coworkers were great. Of course there were some not so great ones. Management was a little more lenient than they should have been with some of the activity that went on."
good,It's a good job it's up to u on what u make out of it . You have people who are sometimes not feeling well so they tend to have a attitude you just got to be the bigger person an handle the situation like a adult should
good,Good people but some days not so great just  keep a good head on you.Out going and hard working staff. Getting to see new people and regulars.The start and end of the the the day.

good,When I started there we had a good team. We got the work done but there wasnt enough staff to cover the store do it became frustrating when trying to control theft.
good,"Open the store and make sure everything was stocked up in its place , then clean up a little. Then my day would begin by greeting the customers with my high quality customer service skills. Lastly I would close the store and end with daily and closing sales. The managers are great when it came to changing shifts."
good,I worked around a lot of positive people and customers. It did have its days where some people were not as nice but most the time everything was great.
good,"A typical work day at family dollar was simple. The opening manager would come in check the store for hidden customers, count the safe and drawers and get prepared for the day."
good,Family dollar was laid back. The one thing that I hated about this job were the run outs that we had all the time.  The pay is okay if you are just starting out

good,open store count safe make bank deposit make displays put out product for sale. The hardest part is unloading the shipment truck. The job was a nice place to work I just had to work too many hours 72+ a week.
good,"Would love to go back and work at family dollar "

good,It was very friendly and everyone helped out. The hours were very flexible and I would work there again. The job was very easy to do and the people made it better.
good,"A typical day at work is usually predictable and productive. You will quickly learn that there is always something to do and customers to please. Workplace environment is very family oriented, welcoming all cultures and walks of life. This workplace is has many complex aspects about it like stocking merchandise in a limited time frame.But you are rewarded with good feedback of customers and store managers when everything is done and displayed correctly."
good,"Fast paced, flexible schedule, helped to develop my management skills offers Heath care and benefits as well as paid vacations. Encourages team work environment"
good,"i enjoyed the ever changing environment. no two days were identical. the management tries very hard to listen to employee suggestions. management always made each employee feel as though we were all part of a team, each person as valued as the next"
good,"It was a part-time job and i enjoyed working with people. The hardest part was the fear of being robbed or worse. you come in contact with quite a few people, so you constantly pay attention."

I would do this for four hours then take a break for 15 minuites then go back to it. later around 8.00 I would sweep the whole entire store with a long broom then mop the whole entire store and then wait to lock up the store.

good,I had a great boss. I enjoyed working there. The only thing was the different hours we had to work. The hardest part of the job was unloading freight.
good,"As an assistant manager at Family Dollar there are many duties, I learned a lot and have grown in the customer service world.  Management changes often, sometimes for the good and sometimes for the bad.  The hardest part of the job is prioritizing the seemingly impossible amount of tasks to be completed.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to help customers and see them return as loyal customers."
good,If you have the right crew in place then it could be one of the best job you could imagine! The people I knew inside and outside of my store were awesome! But the higher up people need to start cracking down on store managers who are just there for a paycheck!

I learned how to check in vendors ( Pepsi, Coca Cola and Frito Lay, etc.) We were in a system that required the unloading of a truck, consistent cash handling. I began as an Assistant Manager and after 6 months, I was promoted to a Field Merchandiser. After a strong 4 months, I was promoted to Store Manager. The attitude reflects leadership in this culture, it was a very demanding position so a positive attitude is necessary. The hardest part of this job was the communication from upper level management. If not delivered in a timely manner, some deadlines could be missed. The constant workload kept me satisfied with this job. I like to stay busy."

good,"A typical work day for me, once I arrive I check the task list to see what is expected of me for the day. There is nothing hard about my job. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to assist my co-workers in making sure our customer are provided with exceptional customer service."

good,"It's fast paced, your always moving no matter what you never standing in one spot. I learned cashiering, sales, trucks loading and unloading. Managment is good, the managers are usually helping when the cashier needs help they work fast and help get things done and help clean the store. The hardest part of the job would be when your by yourself cashiering and theres no one to help you have to be extra careful in counting the money so at the end of the day your not over or your not under. What i loved about the job was meeting completely new people from different parts of the city as well as states and countries and getting to interact withthem and speak to them a little."
good,"i like the fact it was different, fast paced but lot to keep you busy, co workers were cool and so was one of the managers she alwayse gave us good advice and support, the other one i worked for stayed in the aisle on the phone and blamed everyone else when something went wrong. the hardest part is you got to get used to fast paced and multitasking, but the enjoyable part is actually working with people"

good,it was seasonal but i enjoyed my job there and wished i could of stayed longer the pay is not real competitive but probably better now
good,"A basic third shift job at Family Dollar included walking about 10miles each night, between going down 40-70 rows of product you were in charge of going up stairs and taking property counts of each individual product. Nice and quiet, you could have time to think, and most of the work is laid back. You weren't on a set schedule but you did have certain things you needed to have done. Most of the office staff were women, so there isn't a lot of conversation, but they were easy to get along with."
good,Working at Family Dollar is a Great Learning Environment and Very Reliable Co-Workers who is always there to assist you in any way they can.
good,Working here at Family Dollar was a routine. My co-workers were fun to be around & work with. I enjoyed the work load & My manager was a good person.
good,I work at family dollar for a year now and I must say it was a great experience teaching me about how to get the job done on a set period and also the importance of team work
good,"Family Dollar was my first job working in Customer Service. It was a great learning experience and even though I switched different stores and worked with different managers, I always liked working there and helping customers."
good,A typical day at work would include handling cash and credit transactions and tending to customers needs. Customers and law enforcement in this area are familiar with store team member. Never felt unsafe while working at this location. Employer and employees were accepting and nice.
good,Managerial skills are continuously developed and evolving. Physical dexterity is necessary to succeed and the business culture is always enjoyable.
good,"Open store"
good,Family dollar was overall a pretty decent job. Flexible schedule. Easy commute. Daily task. Organize other merchandize as needed and Assist customers with item selection in the absence of other staff. Maintain back stock areas for all merchandise and replenish shelf supplies.
good,the hardest part is dealing with theft the enjoyable part is using my superior customer service skills to help customers
good,I liked the job I had at Family dollar. I liked working there and I also liked shopping there too.. I would love to work there again.
good,This company was a very fun company to work for. They offered a lot of room for growth and advancement.The company gave me the chance to learn how to open stores from the ground up and get them up and running.
good,"Great place to work, fun environment. i have learnt so many things from my co-workers such as customer service is a very good thing to know how to do. No matter how small you think the job is it can have a big impact on others lives."

good,"I have worked for Family Dollar for just a little over a year. I was promoted from Cashier to Assistant Manager in just 6 weeks, where it would normally take 6 months or more. If you make it clear that you want to advance in the company, your Store Manager will do everything possible to help you improve yourself and mentally prepare you for advancement in the company."
good,"This job came with its fair share of annoyances. From low pay and long hours to unpredictable shipments. I enjoyed my overall experience with this company though. I had some of the best co-workers. We were more of a family than co-workers. My store manager would work with us to make sure our home needs were met by giving us the days off we needed. But on the flip side of that, having to work 12-14 hour shifts to get the days off you needed. Especially when the store is open from 9am-10pm, is enough to make anyone crazy. The most enjoyable part of my job was my customers. I strived to make every customer feel like they were welcome, and I feel like I made a lot of new friends along the way that way. I think the hardest part of my job was dealing with the inconsistent shipments every week. It seemed like the Distribution center didn't bother with the cycle count info sent each week and sent whatever they wanted. This lead to major back stock in store rooms, which creates even less room in the already way too cramped store rooms."
good,"During my time there I drove a fork lift and a pallet jack.  I also worked for th temp service  at this  job."
good,"•	Open and Close store "
good,It is a good job  to work at.They just need a better scheduling system.They need to be more flexible with their employee needs.
good,My tipical day at work is to greet customers and provide the best customer service that i can. Also i put up stock and run the cash register.
good,"enjoyed it overall. had the opportunity to feel like i could make a difference in the job by showing my abilities. hardest part of the job was having to audit each classroom and building and put the information into the computer correctly, one button wrong could screw the whole audit up."
good,I loved working for footlocker i really love shoes and i really love selling them just learning about new shoes readind what it helps on your body. really enjoyed my time there.
good,"-unloading boxes"
good,overall working at family dollar was not very fun. it would be the same thing every week and i do not like a job like that. the company does not even give us a brake ever.
good,"Family Dollar is a great company to work for, there is always something to do as far as a work task. The store has great hours with a lot of customers that come and go every hour/ every day! A day in family dollar is very productive and full of wonderful experiences as far as the customer is concerned! You must have a lot of energy to work with this company and the employee's that work with the company are also great! The hardest task i had to complete during my employment was to intake all of the orders from shipment and logged in all the different info about the product coming in and leaving out the store! As a cashier our job was to fulfill all of the customers needs as far as their shopping and relationships that we create between our company and the customer. To ensure 100% satisfaction is guaranteed!"
good,coworkers was fun to be around and we all was like family I didn't like the fact that they didn't give out raises to much
good,I enjoyed family dollars. Family dollars was my first job. The members really made me feel apart of there family. I wish i could work there again great environment.
good,"Family Dollar is a wonderful place to meet different people and a place where everyone is part of the time. You are not set to do one thing and that is it, you are able to do many things. I could run the floor and then run the registers after a while. A good place to work."
good,This company was a great company to work for. the manager was good til the end.
good,"enjoyable, exciting area  to learn and  grow, recomended for the time and product and safety"
good,Good place to work. Love the Customers. Can be a little stressful during holidays.
good,I liked working at this job. Me and my manager got along so well. When other people called in he knew he could count on me to come in. I practically ran that store I was at and would gladly do it again.
good,I have always enjoyed working with people. Provided customer service.
good,It was always just one sale associate and a manger always working. So when it would get busy it was hard because both employees were running the register and there were still people shopping so u weren't able to pay attention to anti-theft. You learned how to do well under pressure and how to handle hectic situations. Co-workers were as helpful as possible but sometimes it just felt a little short handed.
good,"Cashier, stock, help customers find what they need, do paper work and things that need to be done and send counts to District Manager when needed."
good,It was great the first two years.. but after a while it became mundane.
good,Overall good. The only part is that management hasn't hired better staff. Lazy workers.
good,"Pretty simple job. Everything was self explanatory and easy."
good,Family dollar was a laid back job. I liked to keep a smile on my face and greet customers.
good,"unloading trucks, stocking freight, recruiting, terminating, processing employees time , sheets, training, disciplining"
good,Short term summer employment. I've learned about retail with this being my first retail position.
good,"Great Company with lots of opportunity."
good,"Job required me to work in different areas of the store including warehouse, cash register, and sales floor."
good,"Working everyday dealing with people on a consistent  basis was enduring strength, capable of enriching the life's beyond my own. The knowledge and understanding of customer service is rewarding in its own  capacity  There's  room for growth and advancements. Working in the customer care field you will face many challenges, which will only make you stronger and wiser as long as you stick in there and enjoy serving others and helping meet there immediate needs."
good,"*work was always busy."
good,Loved working with all of the people.You can always move up in positons if you work and show them you really want to succeed and move up the ladder
good,worked 52 to 60 hrs. a week. had flexibility to have a good home life.  off every other weekend.  had great workers until my last few months.  hardest part of job was truck days.  had many good customers that i still are in touch with.
good,I enjoyed working with family dollar i stayed busy and got to interact with great people.
good,This company has great benefits and they really work with you with your work schedule.
good,My normal day at work is me filling orders needing to be shipped. A day in the warehouse for me I would say is a 8 hr shift in which I had to throw about 1500 cases a day at about 150-200 cases an hr. The numbers you see are basically what was needed to make production. Now I must admit its not done everyday but 80% of the time that was my daily duty mon-fri. While in this facility I learned how to operate different forklifts manage inventory and other daily duties in a warehouse better than I had already known. The hardest thing was learning how to maintain an accurate pace to my picking skills so that I didn't tire myself out before my shift was over. Daily challenges do occur and safety is an important factor in the industrial business. In conclusion with all that being said I feel warehouse positions or anything dealing with freight I take good pride in it has become a passion of mine and I must say I love and enjoy doing it.
good,"Very good first job, when you put fourth the work it will get noticed."
good,"Working here was great. The environment was good. For the most part my co-workers were fun to be around and the managers were good to get along wit. My day consisted of standing long hours, Inventory ,Stocking shelves, Costumer Service but that was my job so i had to do it ."
good,I enjoyed going to work everyday. It was so long ago but the only down side was the pay back then.
good,I stocked shelves. I ran cash register and worked with the public.
good,Family Dollar was a progressive and wonderful place to expand my work ethic. The employees were helpful and easy going. Everyone executed their position to the best of their abilities. Working for Family Dollar was an exciting and challenging experience The customers played a huge role in what I enjoyed the most. Interacting with various individuals is heart warming and it makes me feel good to be able to assist others anyway I can.
good,"Working made me realize how exciting it is too wake up everyday and meet new people, I made a few lifelong friends here, stocking merchandise was very simple for me because i have always been on the strong side . my favorite part of the job was when we got busy because time would flow lot faster ."
good,"Everyone got along great.  We always had a ""breakfast club"".  They encouraged me to be active in the local nurses association"
good,Always doing something for the customers. Learning new things.
good,"I have enjoyed my employment at Family Dollar for 15 years. I have had the opportunity to work in several departments through the DC and landed the position I was waiting for as the 3rd Shift Desktop Support Specialist in 2005. As of August 30, 2014 the company is doing away with all the Desktop Support Specialist in all of the eleven DC's, which will leave me available to find employment elsewhere. My employment at Family Dollar has given me incredible skills and knowledge of warehouse, office and IT operations."
good,At work I had to rearrange Family Dollar stores Mondays thru Fridays. I gained my experience in customer service. My co-workers was friendly and enjoyable to work with. It was nothing hard about the job at all. I enjoyed getting up Every Monday thru Friday going into work.
good,"Not a bad place to work, wish we could have more payroll!  I have a great staff and enjoy working for Family Dollar."
good,"a regular day at work would start early for me because i'm a stock person. I have to make sure the packages that come off the delivery truck are carefully and neatly stored in the stock room. During business hours i walk the floor to see if there is any merchandise out of place and/or shelves needs refilling. I'm usually the person who helps wit the marked down items. I had one manager that didn't like my productive work & didn't want me to rob them of their position, but the hardest thing about the job was trying not to offend anyone with my work ethic. i mostly enjoyed rearranging the stock room when ever its full or i have restocked the sales floor"
good,i learned so much here. this is where i first learned how to become an effective manager.
good,"you are busy from the time you get there till you leave. I learned it takes commitment, teamwork, taking a lot of responsibility and the great feeling of doing a great job. my coworkers were mostly great hard workers. I promoted quite a lot of them. the hardest part of the job was dealing with the thieves. the most enjoyable part was seeing a job well done. the store stocked, recovered  and the regional manager telling you that even though you are managing one of the hardest stores in the district, its the best he has ever seen it."
good,"A day at work was getting the store ready and open for business .  From walking the sales floor to see what tasks need to be completed from getting the registers open, safe counted and checking emails from upper management,  do the daily paperwork like cashier forms loss prevention forms.  I have learned to use my time more wisely with Family Dollar than previous jobs I had also the truck unloading was different due to the fact that there was not as much to deal with.  The upper management is a good group of people that you can go to if you have questions of any kind and are there for support if you need it.  The Co workers are good as they are support of the store and work together as a team to get a job done in a timely manner. They are also respectful and take ownership on their assigned tasks.  The hardest part of the job is at times there is freight to be worked up and upper management may cut payroll and it is challenging to complete tasks with little to no help,  The most enjoyable part of the job is making the customers happy and make sure they have a open door for them to return also to get to know different kinds of people."
good,"Kept the integrity of the store maintained through proper managerial skills, cleaning and straightening the aisles, maintaining customer satisfaction, cleaning spills immediately, keeping workers content as they carried out their jobs objectives, etc. Unloaded delivery trucks, put boxes into the proper, organized area, cleaned any debris from the worksite after delivery. Closed and opened the store through hours of operation, counted down the cash drawers of the employees after their shift to ensure the correct amount of money was inside of them. Helped employees through difficult problem solving situations."
good,"A great place to work and meet new people. You can learn a lot from retail if you have a good manager. I had a good manager that was there for me. She taught me how to do price changes, payroll, scheduling, meeting the needs to customers."
good,i learned a great deal of responsibility. very high energy job. team work and communication are very important.
good,a typical day at work would be for me is to put up the product. clean clean and more clean recover the mess that was left behind. cashier handling. opening or closing the store. i have learned a new style of how you can become a better manager. the mangement is all on one accord to get all things done. the co-workers work together and help one another out. team work is always very good to have as well as the communication between the employees and the management. the hardest part of my job is none because i am able to handle each situation with logical methods and understanding. The most enjoyable part of my job is that i get paid every friday.
good,Becomiing a manager was great and working in a fast paced job was a rewarding job.
good,"A typical day included opening cash drawers with correct balances, reviewing store condition, assigning directives to my team, reviewing my own objectives and goals, holding team accountable for days activities, balancing drawers and making deposit bags with occasional inventory depending on shift schedule. I learned store procedure and how to perform most of my job functions, especially guiding a team. My co-workers were mostly reliable and driven individuals, if not occasionally slow. the hardest part of my job was mobilizing a team with a focused direction, and I enjoyed making my store presentable and inviting."
good,"I enjoyed working for the company, they just didn't pay well, and that's why I left"
good,"Family Dollar is a great store to work for as long as you do not move up the ladder too quickly. I started as a cashier and moved up to Assistant Manager within 5 months. I enjoyed that position and was very good at it. When I was offered a Managers position over my own store, I could not say no. I took the job without relay thinking it through and not being fully prepared for the overwhelming responsibility of being the Store Manager. Without proper training, I did not last long as manager. The 60+ hours a week and too little staff I had was too much for me to take. I let Family Dollar with a heavy heart. I loved working for the company, but being a manager was too much for me to take. "
good,"working at family dollar was a fun and interesting experience."
good,"It was a pleasure working at Family Dollar. I was able to stay very busy, there was always something to do."

good,"Very good company to work for, I enjoyed the people that i work with, and enjoy working other IT Departments."
good,It was a good job and the managers were good. The benefits I got were good. Everything about this job was good and I enjoyed it
good,Over all my work experience with Family Dollar was good. Great Company & Owners. They just didn't have enough hours to give for the help that was needed to cover the store to benefit the company from theft & help keep your staff safe.

good,My co-workers were great people. It was a small town so I got to know the people. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers.
good,"Overall, They were a good company to work for. I stayed one year and was trained on different jobs. The management team was very experienced and hard working. The volume of the work in one day was not distributed evenly amongst employees. Some employees would leave at end of day while other employees were still working to complete daily goals. I did enjoy my tenure there."
good,"it requires a lot of patience to work at walmart"
good,I have enjoyed working with my co-workers and customers.  I'm interested in finding another part-time job to increase my hours.

good,"I loved working here. The people and mgmt. was great. You must know how to interact with negative people when it comes to refunds, ads and returns. I would definitely work here again. Its hard but steady employment."
good,I enjoyed working with my co-workers and having their help so that after that I new what I could do on my own.
good,"Organization of key staff to process truck and maintain store presentation."
good,I wasn't here long.  I was about 6 months pregnant when I started but had fun while I was there
good,While working at Family Dollar I mainly stayed at the register. I also pushed freight up front but close enough to assist customers and check them out with their items. The hardest part was going back and forth from the register to the floor. I did enjoy those days where I stayed on the floor.
good,"Mainly a typical day at work I would organize the store, make sure everything was clean, put back the way it sould be, stock the floor. Then once the store opened I would mainly be a cashier. I learned to communicate with custmers, be patient with customers, how to deal with a til of money, and be organized. At this job I was pretty much on my own but when a co-worker needed anything we were there to help whatever the problem would be. The hardest part of my job was when I had to deal with people shealing things. I had to approch them in a way that they didn't feel cornered. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing everyone working together as a team."
good,"fast past job with a lot of hours offered."
good,"Going to work, seeing what needs to be done. What I have learned was how to be a leader. The best part of my job was my co-workers and the customers."

THe I would walk the store to make note ot the work that needed to be done on the sales floor. Delegat tasks to sales floor associates , do my paper work and prepare the deposit from the nite befor to be dropped off at the bank.. I would then return to the sails floor to assist my assoicates wiht whatever needed to be done.

good,It was hard to get the employees to do the job that needed to be done by a job time.
good,This company has great benefits and there is always a opportunity for advancement
good,Very nice place to work. great boss and team leaders. showed alot of respect 
good,Family Dollar is definitely not the type of retail that I'm used to but it has helped me to develop as a manager.  I am proud of the store that I work in and often am told by customers that it is the cleanest most organized of the Family Dollars in our area.  I am slated to get my own store soon and am very excited about that.
good,"I was the assistant store manager in two local stores. In both stores the stores, the staff was incredible. We all had a team first mentality which I believe should be common in any workplace."
good,Learned everything there is to learn about customer service and running a store.
good,"I started with morning shift working at Family Dollar in Brooklyn Park , MN. I would arrive at work at 7 sometimes 8 . I first put my belongings in my locker in the back , lock in , and then begin to count my cash register to make sure its the right amount of money to start da day and also enough change. If the store is slow then I have a ""shop back"" cart where i walk not to far from my register to put items back on the shelf and also make sure its neat. Sometimes I'm not on register the whole day and i stock , price items and/or make the shelf to put the items on. I like being on register but i also like stocking gives me more of a chance to help customers. All my co-workers was friendly and easy to work with. Hardest part was getting more hours. Over all this was a really good job and if i didn't move I would probably still work here."
good,Not bad and decent pay. I learned to be a well rounded manager.
good,"By the end of the day my back and feet hurt but if that's what I need to do than I have no complaints. I put products away through out my my shift. I have to keep my eyes on the register so I can run up and check the customer out. As well as greeting every customer that comes through the door. Then, later on through the night I am required to recover the food section. as well as other parts of the store if I complete the food early. Once we close, I then clean the floor, get the trash, refill the bags, take returns back, clean counters, and make sure the every thing is signed. My managers are nice but will be straight forward as well.I have no complaints towards any co workers.The hardest part of the job for me is having to know when a customer is at the register at all times. Not everything I have to put away is in sight of the register so it makes it difficult. I enjoy the smiles of my fellow co workers and customers the most. That's what makes everything worthwhile. "
good,"Ability to learn, advance, and grow. Many long term employees, Accommodations for the individual personal needs "
good,Hours and management was great.  Loved the customer.  The work day goes by fast.
good,"A typical day at work starts at 6 am with stocking or unloading the truck on delivery days. The store opens at 8, so there was limited time to stock and recover the sales floor before the customers started shopping. The work environment really depends on the people, but the staff I worked with was amazing. The hardest part of the job is unloading the truck because the physical demand can exhaust you if you aren't prepared to unload up to 1400 boxes in 2 hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customer interaction. You never know who you will meet, or how that experience will touch you."
good,"count money, greet customers, answer phone calls, and stock products"
good,"Fast paced, always on the move in the busier stores.  I managed the new one sales store in my district several years. Store stocking was always a priority to maintain customer traffic is such a busy market.  Customer Service was always the number one priority. I developed a great team of assistant managers and customer service reps that meant my store had very little turn over of employees. "
good,"It was a very good company to work for with good benefits"
good,"This place gave employees opportunity to work a lot of hours, it was enjoyable but difficult at times. When I was working here they were going through inventory so we had to clean the store until it was almost spotless. We spent many hours working overtime to get the store to look exceptional. "
good,"A typical day at work is fairly slow in the morning and fast paced in the evening. I learned how to work well with people, earned great customer service and cashier experience. The management was run very well.  All my co workers were very nice to me and patient and they trained me very well.  The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the pace but I eventually learned how to do it. I think the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people."
good,It is a good working environment. You learn how to communicate with people better. Whether they are mean or nice. I have learned more about stocking. The hardest part was stocking and running the cash register at the same time. The co-workers are fun to be around at times. The most important part of the job was counting the money and making sure everything was right. 
good,"It was very bust at time, which made the time go by fast, eveyone was a team player."
good,opening the store and making sure it ran good well i learned the customer is always right my co workers were nice to work with
good,"My responsibilities were pulling freight from dock, and dropping in assigned"

good,"good hours, learned baling experience good co-workers nothing hard about the job really. most emjoyable part of the day was clocking in and working."
good,Work cash register and greeted customers. I learned how to work a cash register. Co-Workers were fun and got the job done. Hardest part when people try to steal from store.Enjoyable part was helping the customers get what they need.
good,Loved the job..But it was 3rd shift..Loved the over time..Warm place to work..People friendly
good,"No day was the same. You had your regular customers you knew by name and then you had customers that were just passing through, or were just wanting to see another Family Dollar Store. I learned which customers you could short talk with and which ones wanted to tell you their life stories. I absolutely loved working for this company and would go back again in a heart beat."
good,I was a cashier and occasionally stocked shelves. I did work alot of days that went from 9-9 due to other workers calling in sick.
good,"Everyday was different but enjoyable, the job had alot of perks such as the great bonus every year."
good,"Open the doors to eager customers. Learned responsibility, team work, the importance of balance as far as productivity and customer service. My supervisor was available when needed. Had outstanding employees for the most part. The hardest part of the job was having enough payroll in the budget to cover shifts. The most enjoyable was learning new ways of doing old things"
good,"Typical day consist of keeping the store clean.. adjusting merchandise to appeal to customers; cash handling with customers, unloading truck;"
good,"Nice place to work, hardest part of work was dealing with unhappy customers"

good,I loved working for this company because I am a person who thrives on helping others. Unfortunately they did not hold my position for me while I was in the hospital giving birth to my son. This was their only down fall.
good,"greating customers, training staff.. What I have learned from this job is working in retail takes a team who are willing to work together. I enjoyed each one of my DM and my staff were great had the same employees for over 4 years and Asst manager. The hardest part of this job was the carzy long hours each week. Most enjoyable my great customer and staff."
good,handling cash reigster meeting various people good managment learn about products that sales
good,My district manager allowed work independently and to run my store was rhe largest stores in Temple. He gave his visions as it related to the store and he jusr let me make ir happen. I should not have left.
good,Managed retail store location within the company's established policies and achieved budgeted revenue and expense.
good,"Very fun co-workers their, team work is done and handled greatly. Understandable managers. Great customer along with regular customers."
good,Even though I only got minimum wage my bi-weekly salary was way better than my last job. The hardest part was dealing with customers and stocking at the same time. Trying to keep an eye out for customers while stocking something on the very last aisle. Dealing with a disgruntled co worker all the time.
good,"A typical day at work would include being a cashier, answering all incoming calls, and stocking shelves about three times a week. Throughout my year at Family Dollar, I have learned a lot about Customer Service. These lessons include handling money, customer complaints, thieving situations, and learning the ability to cope with the different personalities of the customers and co-workers. I like the management, although they make it difficult for me to be able to go to school and work at the same time. We have a very steady and comfortable work environment. Everyone gets along and we have fun while working together, while also being very productive. After Inventory Check our store placed 2nd out of 25 other locations. The hardest part about my job would be the change in shifts. My hours tend to be unpredictable on a daily basis, sometimes I will work 10 hours with no break. The most enjoyable part of my job is the fact that I am always busy and I keep moving. There's always something that needs to be done."
good,"I start by open store ,count money,get worker's list of thinks to do.Handle any problems during the day.Some unload truck,log freight,and put out freight.Also make displays to corporation standers.Close store, drop off deposits to the bank, and make building is locked up and safe."
good,Funny group of people but in a professional way.highly recommended job.
good,"On a typical work day at family dollar I would have a cashier running the register and handling customers. Then I would stocker the store, and or do the schmatices to ensure the store was properly set as the company had applied."
good,it was a very busy job and i really enjoyed the regular customers and meeting the new ones. a day for me at work was helping the customer have a wonderful time shopping at the store. and getting what they needed or wanted. i learned alot about people and hard work does pay off. i enjoyed working with my co workers. they are still my friends as of today. the hardest part of the job was unloading the trucks. but my coworkers always made a game out of it so it would be more productive and enjoyable. i enjoyed my job. i loved the people and the work.
good,"Working at Family Dollar was a very good learning expeirience for me, I enjoyed being assistant manager I like taking the lead in projects and pulling together a team and finishing the projects we were given. I am great at problem solving and was able to utilize this skill here when at times customers were not happy."
good,Family is a good place to work. I enjoyed working with the people there.
good,Family Dollar was very secure and understanding. They worked around my schedule and gave me a lot of hours.
good,I am a program manager. I have worked at Family Dollar for around two and half years. Lead a number of programs to their completion
good,"Manager was friendly and helpful, as well as my fellow employees."
good,The skills I learned with this company got me the position I was hired for at Walmart.
good,"work at cash register, stalk, face items, tag items it was all good"
good,"My work consisted in stocking merchandise, unloading the truck, providing customer service, cash register and cash handling. Management was really good and understanding. She was a great joy to work with. Co-workers at Family Dollar were really nice and did not mind helping with anything."
good,A day at work starts by taking a walk through the store checking all aisles and storage rooms. Open store emails' opening registers and assigning team mates to specific task. Check store orders' make store orders.Document in log books' cash management and vendor deliveries. Set up displays and customer service. I learned in this environment things can change by the minute and you have to able to adjust your schedule at a moments notice. You can reach out to other store managers for help for any task you may have difficulty with. Holidays are the busiest time that can make your day a little harder but i derived great satisfaction when customers are happy with the customer service and products.
good,Very fun and open workplace work flow great coworkers great good break time.
good,"Open and close the store on schedule days. Unload the new shippments, Make sure the store is running in order and everything is in order. Count the registers when employees leave or coming in to work."
good,While the enviroment is a pleasant one the pay is not enough and even less with the small amount of hours you are given.
good,I had a wondeeful time working at Family Dollar but as in all companies 1 person can spoil it
good,Need more hours on the daily basis and needs to hire more associates. Also I would love to have health  and dental and sick leave . Also 401k would be awsome
good,"Very flexible with ones needs, willing to train when needed, doesn't pay much and doesn't have good benefits, great way to meet people, however too much theft from customers"
good,Enjoyed my time at Family Dollar.  Was given the opportunity to advance and learn a lot about the business.  The merger with Dollar Tree changed a lot of things (mainly the culture and ultimately even the location).  Would probably still be working there if they hadn't relocated the headquarters.
good,"This job helped me to learn a great deal about working independently, organization and loss prevention, and inventory management. The atmosphere at Store #1134 was a very welcoming place with a great manager."
good,with the position as a theft prevention manager at my store i had the responsibilities of maintaining  the quality of the front end of the store while also stopping about 5 walk out thefts a day. The neighborhood was high volume so I had to take notice of everything.
good,Very bad management no time off no breaks no overtime allowed no 40 hr work week change ur schedule with out asking u  no ontime schedule  people stealing all the time
good,"Family Dollar was great when I first started the co-workers was friendly, and the job was easy with nice pay. My boss was hard on me but only to push me to be ready for the future."
good,As an assistant manager your guaranteed 40 plus hours! Your experience will be throughout the entire store! It won’t be nothing in the store that you haven’t learned and mastered.
good,"I've been working at Family Dollar for 2 1/2 years now and I can say with confidence that this has been my favorite place of employment since I entered the workforce. Everyone's experiences will differ partially due to management and location. I had a great manager and a very cooperative and helpful district manager which made my experience way better than most.  The benefits at Family Dollar are fairly good compared to similar companies and I think my wage was fair. To succeed, you will have to be willing to put in the work and show up on time. 9/10 would recommend working here to a friend. "
good,"Family Dollar is, overall, a good company to work for. I never had any problems with the staff or management. The company rules and policies are easy to be complied with."
good,Management was very good. Flexible if you need to take care of other things on your own time. Teamwork and cashiering was good my first job was with Family Dollar.
good,The experience paid more than a fast food and more relaxed and prepare you for more better jobs in the future. Hours are good and management is great.
good,I really enjoyed working at family dollar and getting to know each and every employee. It was a great work place and I'd reccomend it to anyone who is looking for a great job!!
good,I would be more enthusiastic with customers and help build the company into a better company. Family Dollar is a good company with lots of team work. You should leave all personally business at home and get prepared to work.
good,El problema es que pagan quincenal y muy poco ....
good,"Family dollar was a great place to work. I started as sales associate and worked my way up over the years t"
good,"Family Dollar did offer me the chance to learn many new things that helped me to start other jobs as well. As a previous assistant manger, who worked at two locations at family dollar, now I have the confidentiality  and the experience to start any retail job."
good,Store manger is great and actually cares for her employees.  But corporate owned and that's the stressfulness. Corporate makes it difficult to succeed in having a productive store and no back up with those customers.  You know the ones iiii mean. The ones u wanna quit on spot so you can tell them off. They know we can only do what corporate allows us.
good,When the store got robbed I didn’t go back scared me I never been thought that ever in my left but other then that it’s a good company. Family Dollar stores
good,"Real easy job very simple, easy to catch on if you have experience with cash registers. Stocking not bad at all just have to be fast and focused . Managers real nice and works with you if you need days off or more days added on the schedule"
good,It’s wonderful staff helps a positive work environment. Once you get the hang of it it’s a great place to work. Not to hard. Just on truck days it’s faster pace than normal! Love all my boss’s wonderful people!
good,I love the fast moving environment. A normal day at work would be getting there and loaning on to my register and beginning the day. The store manager was good at giving the days off that I needed to take care of my kids. The hardest part of the job is unloading the truck during the summer time. the most enjoyable time is working as a team to keep the store together.
good,Liked the place and the customers but the district manager comes in and interrupts the flow of the store without even asking how the workers feel. I would work here again though
good,mangers are great to work with an very understanding did not mind helping you out when thees something wrong or you dont understand  i had an great time working for this company
good,"family dollar is good company. the pay could be raised more due to the demands that all employees are faced to complete. a typical day was to open the store, great all customers, stocking, updating prices and shelf placement for product(POG), inventory, scheduling, training and much more. again not a bad job just really demanding. not a job where you can sit at a register."
good,There usually was a steady flow of people in and out which kept you busy. Also there were a ton of stocking and turning everything the ight way it was a steady paced job.
good,My manager and co-workers were really nice and down to earth. I just didn't get enough hours. The work was relatively easy. The customers were generally pleasant.
good,I had really mangers but the customers were some of the rudest people I’ve meet. Moved to a different family dollar and the manager would tell you they needed you for a shift an hr before and never really had a  schedule done on time
good,It was a great place to work before it shut down. I had a wonderful manager always worked with me she cared about us and our families. Just a overall great place to work
good,"A typical day at family dollar will start off slow very calm then as the day goes it on it becomes very busy and hectic. I've learned how to manage pressure and handle manager duties if needed. Management is, for the most part, professional but some can be lazy at times. workplace culture very urban. The hardest part of the job is doing my job and the manager on duty job while I have multiple customers to assist. The most enjoyable part is helping the customers find what they are looking for and look forward to when I'm working because they enjoy my services."
good,"Some days are slow, some are fast. Truck days i’ll try to get at least 2-3 u-boats done fast and neat. The manager was very helpful and always had her store neat. The hardest part of the job is when it’s busy and trying to stock shelves, it’s just too congested."
good,"You get out of it what you put into it.  The customers are the best part of the day.  Days are long and busy, never have nothing to do.  The potential to advance is great."
good,"Family Dollar provides a great place to work for single people or people with older children.  The customers are great to work with, there is a lot of physical demands and stress."
good,I could have seen myself retiring with Family Dollar if they were giving adequate raises. The coworkers were great. We worked well together. I worked 3 different stores and out of those 3 the assistant had more experience than the manager .
good,"As an assistant manager for a startup store, i really enjoyed being employed by the company. The staff was very family friendly, and i enjoyed working with regular customers each day. The work load isnt too heavy and the salary meets the job description."
good,"I would of liked to stay but I had a baby and it was too much at the time but it was a good company to work for. If you're a people person, which I am then it a very easy job."
good,Although I was only there for a short time before Iwent to college it was fun and gave me this drive to push my self to be a good leader. I liked the role I was in sad to leave my position.
good,A pleasure it be part of it as experience needed. Manager was really upfront nice and friendly. The co workers were reliable and honest. It was fun and fast paced. It was treated like a humble family.
good,"Family Dollar was already a very friendly and clean store to shop in, it was easy to get to, and very helpful. When I was hired i was given hours right away which was very helpful. CBT's were done to teach employees what to do and what not to do in situations, my past work experience at food lion, I cleaned so I had no problem doing any of the dirty work because I actually felt appreciated unlike other stores I have worked for. I always think about retail only because of my experience working for Family dollar. You were able to independently do your tasks but someone could always be on call and helped if I needed it. Dollar General is trying but Family dollar also has better prices, which myself and other people I would recommend visiting for pretty much anything a store doesnt have."
good,Was very pleased with customers and customer service given.  Fvorite aspect of job interacting with customers.  At time I qorkwd there the entire staff worked as team and got things done as expected. Duties were deligated approiatly management was kind and compassionate to family needs adjusted schedule accordingly.
good,Great upward mobility for driven individuals with good leadership skills.  Advancement available for career minded managers with reasonable benefits.  Pay commiserate with job duties.
good,"I unloaded trucks, stocked shelves, lead employees, ran the cash register, and took deposits to the bank. This job was highly physical without enough pay. It was enjoyable though."
good,"Assistant Manager"
good,My experience with the inventory management team was great. I left for personal reasons that had nothing to do with the company. They work with you when life happens. Don't over monitor your time (if you go over you lunch break or come in late once in awhile). Management does their best to make things happen when there are issues. Fantastic VP.
good,loved working @ family dollar it was a great place to show my manager qualities and help customers in a conjested invironment always looking forward to possibly working for them again if that oppertunity arrives although my release from the position there troubles me just again working for the company itself had its positives always great  work with public ive done it for 26 years it wa a great oppertunity for me
good,I was actually hired on while being 7 months pregnant so that was really great of them to do for me. The co-workers were really great and helped out a lot. My manager was amazing at explain to me how everything ran and understood that I wouldn't be able to keep up as much as others and didn't expect me to push to much.
good,Fast pace company and require to work long hours. Advancement takes a while to move up in the company.  Its also a good company to work for if you are looking for part time or either full time if its available
good,I enjoyed it for the most part. Everyone was friendly for the short period of time I was there. Manager is awesome. You just have to be patient with the customers because they get a little crabby.
good,"A typical day at work was normally ok. I learned how to manage a team. My store manager is an amazing person. Most of the time workplace culture was positive. The hardest part of the job was unloading trucks, the most enjoyable part was making a customer happy."
good,"I enjoyed this company however I moved to Fort Pierce, Fl and it was a lot to do the forty minute drive in the condition my vehicle was in. Over time is not a guarantee, however, due to great work ethics I was allocated over time most weeks than not."
good,Great people to work with. Very understanding on hours. Employees were very nice and helpful. Very driven employees. Store was always clean and never had one complaint.
good,"Not a bad job just no room for me to advance as I'd like to. Work is typically busy, always something to do. My manager and coworkers were super easy to get along with and made the job enjoyable."
good,I enjoyed working for family and would like to work there again if I could get paid a little more. I would like to work full time and receive more hours. the people were friendly and the manager was always willing to work with the associates to accommodate their needs.
good,"Great store manager to work for. Lots of lifting, we get 2 trucks a week and are required to unload trucks and stock the floor within 48 hours of receiving. Register system is easy to learn and use."
good,"cashier work freight help customers clean store set new features."
good,"Nice company to work for if you are people friendly.You meet,greet and help customers everyday. Always stay positive in a atmosphere surrounding customers to further relationship."
good,Family dollar is a good job in you’re looking to grow in managing. Shows great value in practicing leadership and developing skills. Trains you every step of the way and never makes you feel left out.
good,I liked working at Family Dollar because it felt like a family business I would go back to work at family dollar because the employees and manager gave a good and welcoming vibe I would recommend family dollar to anyone.
good,Opening and closing of the store. getting draws ready for the day. daily deposits. stocking and recovery of the store. unloading the truck. taking invetory
good,Family Dollar was a convenient workplace with overtime options if needed and a fair pay. It is multicultural with opportunities to become a manager if you put in the work. It has many flexible hours and you can work part time if you want to go to school.
good,"Everyone gets along. Easy to learn the new positions if needed. Management system is great. Hardest part is knowing how to deal wit rude customers or robbers. As long as you are productive, you can listen to music or talk to others."
good,I would recommend The family Dollar for anyone that doesn't have any or very little work history. They were communicative and flexible with days off or emergencies.
good,"Lots of work to do, great teammates, opportunities to advance, must be a self starter. Better communication from leadership is needed. Resources are limited, makes jobs difficult to complete."
good,Its a very easy job the staff is very easy to get along with you can get as many hours you want most days at work would be crazy but then other times it's cool.
good,"My first job was here it was easy to understand your role and you felt part of a family. Easy unloading, recovery, and easy to use cash register. Closing requires mopping duty."
good,I hired and developed associates to potentially be future managers. Was involved in achieving and maintaining positive inventories for the company. Controlled expenses such as labor and necessary store supplies. Unloaded trucks and counted exception reports.
good,I loved my job and everyone I worked except for my store manager and district manager. Had nothing but problems out of them. The reason I left there was problems with the district manager and store manager not answering me when I try to get in touch with him about my schedule and about how I've been treated at work.
good,"I loved everything about working here but the hours were just crazy and all over the place, they were never steady and half the time it would be just one person working"
good,i learned how to assisted customer and stocked and inventory and work on the floor with customers  it was a good time and place to work for the boss was always understand and always kind and willing to help us
good,"A great to place to work. Family Dollar promotes within, which makes it easy to move up. On the job training keeps employees up with policy and procedure."
good,"i loved working for fAmily dollAR untill we got a new mAnAger who didn't know what he was doing, it was alwAys busy it mAde the time go by faster, theres alwAys something to do"
good,"Enjoyed working for Family Dollar, the first fifteen sixteen years.. As store manager and Training manager for District and company enjoyed teaching especially those that wanted to learn."
good,"I loved working at family dollar!  There were a few kinks that could've been worked out with the ordering process,  but overall it was a very comfortable work environment."
good,"Typical day at work entails counting in your drawer, stocking shelves, cleaning store and making sure everything is at the front of the shelf. Management was previously decent, but the management before leaving was less-than-friendly. Hardest part of job was unloading truck, which was easy. Enjoyable part of job was stocking shelves and throwing out expired products."
good,It was long and tedious days and nights. Store was always open on major holidays like Xmas day. We had to unload our own store shipments off the truck ourselves
good,"Leaving Family Dollar was difficult.  I had gotten used to the stability that the company provided.  With the weekly compensation and scheduling,  life was more manageable."
good,"Family Dollar has a nice Culture and environment, it's a great place to work overall.  The staff is nice and customers are respectful and the compensation is good."
good,"Great advancement Opportunity, Long Hours and hard work. Friendly fast environment. Good Bonuses. Limited paid Vacations. Low labor budget to cover schedule so you can expect to put in many days alone."
good,Working there is a really productive place to work. Most of the time i was a cashier. family dollar was a very organized always have something to do working there.
good,Family dollar was a fast-paced work place. The costumers were polite and respectful. The employees were helpful we worked as a team to make sure things were done on time and right.
good,"A typical day was making sure all the stores ran smoothly. Learned how to juggle different jobs at once Management was excellent and helpful Everyone was very helpful and fun to work with"
good,"Fast environment, love greeting people that come in with sad faces and leave with a big smile on their faces.  Management is good but they are always on the cell phones talking and not helping customers."
good,"Customers came 1st for me. I treated them as I want to be treated when I am shopping. I learned to budget my time better.  Just not enough hours in a day. My store manager was amazing.  She was kind and efficient. As the asst. store manager, we worked really well as a unit. The store I worked in, is in a part of town that has many different cultures. I embraced learning new things from my employees and the customers. The hardest part of the job, definitely was, unloading trucks by myself. I loved being with the customers. I got to know them as people and some of them became friends I still speak to now."
good,"Family Dollar was a great career to excel in. Quick paced, and constantly hiring. However my experience was cut short due to the flexible schedule changes, and lack of communication."
good,"Im happy with my job at family dollar. My manager and assistant managers are great to work for.I enjoy the interaction with my regular customers, it makes the night go by faster when you love what you do."
good,"Staff was great to work with. "
good,The benefits a re really good. They have an open door policy which allows for good communication between employee and employer. although it does have a couple of downfalls. The chances for advancement are limited and the pay is on the lower scale of the industry average.
good,"I leaned how to stock the correct way"
good,The work itself is easy. Truck day will be the only day you'll actually brake a sweat. Maintaining the sales floor orderly and stocked is the bulk of your duties and since it's a small store it isn't very hard once you're in the groove of things. Add that to a an environment that encourages you to make friends with you're coworkers and its a good place to be.
good,Mi ambiente de trabajo es trabajar en equipo tener un buen costumer service y mantener toda el area de trabajo limpia y segura para todos ....
good,I really enjoyed working here. The managers are really fun to be around and easy to work with. Not a hard job to learn and pick up on. Really good hours and flexible.
good,Very awesome but strict.. Great teamwork and the management team is very understanding. DM helps to make sure each employee is treated fair and ready to move on to the next level.
good,"As an Assistant Manager for this company, I have learned several things like the responsibilities that come along with making sure the store is running smoothly and there are no problems among customers and their service. It was easy to catch on because the routine was basically the same every week and the only changes were the seasonal items that would come in to make their way into a new section. There was nothing hard about the job, everything was doable and reasonable. I enjoyed the interaction and relationships I built with several customers, whether they were daily customers or people that would come in every once in a while. It's been an enjoyable time and I believe it is time to continue to move up and build towards my future career."
good,"It was usually only two or three people in the store. A lot to do when maintaining the register, cleaning and stocking while assisting customer needs. However, environment is always friendly and inviting. Faculty is nice and willing to assist."
good,You have to be very dedicated. There are some managers that you have to deal with and have to do the task the way they want you to do. Every day is different do not expect anything to be normal. You have to deal with customer issues and problems with prices.
good,"A typical day at work would have me, come open the store count the money set up displays and things of the such before the store opens. and when the store is open i greet customers sock shelves make sure everything is order, Do store conts to make sure we get enough merchandise on the truck deliver. Unload truck. My district and store managers were really understanding in nature and helped out in any which way they could. Advancement in the compay is as deserved yo uu work hard and work smart you will climb the ladder at the pace of hard work that you put in. the hardest part of the job would have to be inventory dday when you have to count every single item in the store to calculate how much you are missing and made for the year. the most enjoyable part is that they are small teams and you get to know people on a personal level and it really helps out when you are working it makes you wanna work with people that much more."
good,"open the store run registers and have fun with customers and staff"
good,I enjoyed Family Dollar. I was promoted because of my willingness to work and apply myself. While at Family Dollar I was quickly promoted to Assistant Manager. The part I enjoyed most was communicating with customers. I enjoyed making them smile. In return I was smiling and it was a great feeling.
good,"The schedule was very flexible, the management I worked under was good, and the available discounts were great incentive for the work I performed. It was a good job for the time I worked there."
good,Family dollar is a good place to work for the only thing is they need better security to protect they employees more it's dangerous not to have protection
good,I enjoyed working here. It was a great experience for me. you have great employees around you and the customers we easy to handle. A great place to work because they treat you like family.
good,One  aspect  of the job that I  particularly enjoyed was that even though much of the job was  ordinary there was always something  new and different which arose when dealing with people. It was why I stayed for so many years
good,I love this work place but the store manager was not very understanding at all. He only really cared about himself and if it wasn't for that I'd still be employed there right now.
good,"The management is good, the work is not challenging mentally. Sometimes we work really long hours. Which is not ideal. The attendance polive isnt great. If you miss a day and it's busy at work your in trouble but if you miss a day and it's not busy it doesn't matter. There is no real structure to the policy."
good,Clock in do inspection on truck the set up empty  trailers for the call outs when trailers at door are full then inspect more trailer's to be ready to repeat process
good,Family Dollar provided a very secure and friendly place to work with many opportunities for advancement. Management was helpful and provided much training. A great place to start your career.
good,"I enjoyed working there. 28 hours a week, could have used more. Loved stocking store & customers."
good,Productive and fun workplaceI enjoy working at Family Dollar is a great experience you get to meet new people new customers every day you deal with different personalities between the customers  and employees but I got to say I love it
good,This job was everything. I loved my customers and my workplace. It was everything I could ask for. I love the way our employees worked to get the task done or worked together as a team to figure out a problem.
good,I moved up fast with the company and I am thankful for experience and opportunity given. I was laid off unexpectedly and I am eligible for rehire and would proudly accept a job offer from any Family Dollar store.
good,Long hours fast turn around this is a good company for fast advancement. This company has country wide stores so movement opportunities are readily available
good,I loved working for this company. I would come in everyday and i was a closing asst. manager. I would make sure the store was fully stock for the morning. I would clean and asst. the customers on the floor. I would also asst. the other employees with the registers when needed.
good,"In the time I have worked at family dollar it has been non-stop. In a typical day, I will run the the register and put up stock. I love my manager she is amazing she makes sure that the things that are supposed to be done is done but she understands our strengths and weaknesses. Overall I love working at family dollar."
good,"company has changed owners, jobs haved change, New people have been hired.  Daily operations of 23 stores, hiring, firing, working along side of workers to get the job done.  The turn over is plenty, Loved doing my job.  Hardest part was spreading myself thin to get all the stores running correctly."
good,I started out at Family Dollar as a Customer Service Representative. After 6 months of work i was promoted to Assistant Manager. From there I trained multiple CSR's (Customer Service Representatives) as well as new Assistant Managers.
good,"A Typical day at work consists of busy lines and multi-tasking from register to putting out stock at the same time."
good,I have been with the company 14 months and have moved up pretty quickly. I have never worked for a company whose regional and district manager genuinely care about thier people and invest in them. Yes they expect a lot of thier people but they pay well. And its worth it if you ever want to move up the ladder. Good company to make a career out of.
good,I enjoy working for and with my co workers at the South Paris Location. The environment is a great environment to work in.
good,"Management is great. Coworkers also. A decent job overall."
good,"A typical day at work is generally fulfilling to me if I am able to complete all my tasks given to me that day. I learned that time management is extremely important as well as awareness. As a customer service representative, it is required that I am able to multitask. My managers were great people to work for and were very understandable. The most enjoyable part of my job was stocking the shelves because I was able to do it fast while not letting the quality of my work slip."
good,I had no prior experience with a retail store. Started moonlighting as a cashier for extra money. The Store Manager trained me to the position of Asst Mgr. Traveled to many stores to cover shifts and vacations. The money could have been better.
good,"family dollar has a good work team but located in a bad area with many theft and rowdy customers. managers and assistant managers treat you like family and respect all employees. A typical day at work would be cleaning up the store and keeping the store clean while on other days would be on the register and try to clear long lines while keeping customer wait times to a minimum. From what ive learned its a very easy job to learn and even easier to master, once trained the job doesnt feel like a job anymore. Ide have to say the hardest part of the job was keeping the store clean at all times and keeping theft to a minimum. for me the most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers with what they needed and getting them out the store a happy customer."
good,"Loved my job here, but with it being retail you will always have employees that dont want to work, customers that are rude and disrespectful, loved my regulars and the job its self, just have to have a good team to back you not stab you in the back."
good,"A typical day at work starts off with getting yourself organized, making sure everything is well organized for the customers. Running the registers is where I as an employee gets the chance to interact  with the clients. It is always a good thing to make a conversation with     the clients and not make it awkward. Making sure if the customers  need help to let them be aware that you are there to help them. Looking out for the customer is part of customer service, greeting them as they walk in the store makes customers feel welcome."
good,my job is very productive and fun I love going to work because I always meet new people that are very interesting. Workinkg with others is also very enjoyable.
good,Good job to have for customer service experience. Learn how to deal with different type of people.  Hours were consistent and management was very helpful if you have any questions or concerns
good,"A typical day at work would consist of me doing what I was properly trained to do. Fill orders for stores. Operating the center rider, and taking the order to the shipping dock to be shipped off. The management was very nice and patient. The hardest part of my job was working in the heat, but I'm willing to adjust. The co-workers were very respectful"
good,"Fun place to work at, very easy to learn, good team people, great pay, has good hours, and you get the weekend off so it's a plus, every body respects you"
good,"A typical day working at Family Dollar, would be like from the start of you clocking in, you have to get right into business. You would go straight to a cash register and begin counting it to make sure it is the desired amount that your manager chooses. From there you would have to work with customers, check them out, and answer any questions that they may have. If there are no customers that are around or need your assistance than you would pack out product. Then when the day is near to closing, you would have to start cleaning the store, and make sure that the store is recovered. These are task that were needed to be done on a daily basis. My manager and co-workers, were really great to work with, they taught me many things in the company. They helped me grow and got me to learn the company forward and backwards. The hardest part about my job was the security, where the store I was working in, it wasn't the best of neighborhoods, so dealing with troublemakers was regular. Us as the employees had to be very cautious towards certain people, and had to keep our guards up. However, other than that Family Dollar was an amazing experience, it was my first job and i already feel that i have grown and learned so much from it. I really appreciate and love the opportunity i have received with this company."
good,"same thing,delivered freight to family dollar stores,working with store mgr and employees.i unloaded the trailers. i don't know what else to tell you. i would drive my rig and trailer thru residentail areas and park in FD parking lot,safely"
good,the store was always clean arranged and busy all customers were satisfied and always returned the managers were all friendly and led by example and encouraged and motivated the rest of the store workers and very understandin if needed to b absent
good,"i learned so much at this wonderful company. I am highly thankful at family dollar for giving me the opportunity of being a cashier. my co-workers were awesome, made so many friends."
good,"""big company with small town values"" - if you put in your all, it will reap you dividends.  Long hours are expected as in any management position but the compensation is appropriately balanced -"
good,"the job is fun si,mple but can be alot of work in a small amount of time. the jjob has an amazing atmophere of joy from the coustamers and the team members."
good,sometimes very long. I learned how to reset a store. I loved my manager. some of my co-workers tought me a lot. Traviling to other stores and doubles back to back. learning new things and meeting people.
good,"I really liked family dollar as far as day to day operations. Making weekly schedules, set planograms for holiday and weekly sales, Unloading freight trucks and processing freight to shelves. Got to know a lot of customers that shopped at store."
good,"I learned that I should follow protocol instead of just quitting. I loved working with the public, preformed all day to day operations."
good,"its a retail job so the hours are erratic and but the place has a good environment and the day to day work is not hard to manage, i mostly work on getting freight into or out of the warehouse and keeping my cashiers motivated and working. My duties are to manage the store when the Manager is not there, which includes handling the money, opening and closing the store and managing the other employees as well as dealing with any issues with customers or the store systems that arise throughout the day. The hardest part of the job is dealing is dealing with unhappy or even violent customers, but it is not that common of an occurrence."
good,It was busy on and off. Co workers were great. Hardest part is stocking up and fixing products. It was messy and a lot of returns. Best thing was time flew by.
good,Management always made you feel like you were family. We did supported each other. We always made sure everyone was on the the same page and was willing to learn new things. We always made sure that work was fun so you would want to come to work. There was always room to move up in the company.
good,"A typical day at Family Dollar was exciting there where different people you have to deal with. But most of all it was alright I got my work done by the end of my shift if it was stocking, putting out new merchandise or if I had to rearrange things. My manager  was a really nice manager who was also caring she worked around my schedule when I needed it to be done. The hardest part of my job was having to deal with some rude customers but I did not let that ruin my day or take me out of my character."
good,upper management was ok...sometimes they care other times they do not. loved the job just not the location. met a lot of great people there. always something to do and we had some great customers.
good,"Family Dollar is a great company, Nobody is ever late, we work as a team to get stuff acconplished, and the job wasnt difficult,  Customer service is key to the job and II love providing it."
good,"I loved working with the people on my team. My customers knew me and enjoyed coming to the store when I was at work. loved being able to help people, whether it be a coworker or a customer. Making a difference, big or small, is what motivates me in anything I do in life and working retail gave me the opportunity to do that."
good,"Typical day at work: Clock in at 6am, stock the store, take deposit to bank, get cash register money from safe for cashiers, open the store at 9am, continue stocking, clock out and go home at 4pm"
good,"very friendly customers, lovely neighborhood. clean store and very busy work day. must require very high paced time management skills. occasionally required to run store alone."
good,The pay wasn't spectacular but I enjoyed the other employees there.  I worked in the distribution center and the work was very hard but I didn't mind it and we were paid 12.75 an hour.
good,A typical day at family dollar is running the register and stocking. I also recover any aisles that may need it. I enjoy my management team and also my co-workers.
good,This was an experience that helped me learn how to learn on the jpb. Everyday I learned something new on the job and how to incorporate that experience the next day.
good,Everyday i do the same thing i did the day before. One day I might be on the cash register that whole day. The next day I might be on the floor doing recovery and the cash register back and forth. I learn how to keep my peace and stay calm when there's an angry customer. Management is very good. My co-workers are very nice and caring. It's like we are a family they cheer each other up and we work together. My most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the smiles on the customers face and they tell me i brighten up their day.
good,working with family dollar was a great experience. The manager was friendly and always patient. The customers were friendly and I enjoyed helping them.

good,Masonic Home is a great place to work. I did not enjoy my employment there because I worked in the kitchen. It was a good learning experience since it was my first job and I was only 16 when I started there. They're flexible and work with their employees schedules. They had no problem allowing me to switch to per diem when I went away to College.

good,I really enjoyed my time with Family Dollar. There are tons of benefits if you decide to participate and the company is very goal-oriented. Management is great and reacts quickly to all issue that are brought forth. I would refer anyone to Family Dollar for a start in the retail world.
good,"Welcomed at the door with Hello from our Security officer. I log in check emails to see if there is anything that needs my attention right away. I look at my 30 day pays to see when they are do and I fill out a card to pull the file and go pull them and work them. I return calls or make calls to Landlord asking for documentation that they may have missed sending it to be reconciled or to answer any question they may have about their reconciliation. I enjoy speaking with Landlords and putting a personal touch to who they are speaking to making sure that they feel they that they have someone to talk to in this big growing company. The hardest part of the job is sometimes the volume of work that might come, it can be over whelming but I like that I can overcome this situation. My manager is a very good source to go to for questions and problems. She is the first to step in and talk to upper management if there is something that need to be improved. I enjoy working with the people in this company they are very hard workers in the Lease Administration and Store Maintenance department. Over all I really enjoy working at Family Dollar Corporate office."
good,Nice place to work.  Depending on the store you will develop a work family connect with each other and its very easy to move up in the company.  Just the start pay isnt good at all

I like the management and my team members I work with they're pretty easy to get along with. The hardest part of my job so far is learning where all the produts are located and where to put the products that dont have a set home. The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers, some I may know and some I don't but I always treat everyone in a nice manner and respect for everyone always being friendly."
good,"Did books and deposits in am and ordered. unloading trucks and stocking shelves and keeping shelves organized and neat for customers. My manager always took the time to show me everything she knew to prepare me for advancement. My coworkers knew that I wouldn't ask them to do anything I wouldn't do. There was nothing really hard about my job, It just sometimes would be a challenge to get them motivated and to do things the way they needed to be done. I enjoyed customers and good management."
good,"A typical day in the register is attending to customers purchases and returns. As an assistant will be picking up items from floor and putting them back into place. Fronting, facing, spacing the items to ensure products look neat. Help the cashier if the line gets long, count the boxes and make daily store deposit. The hardest part of the job is dealing with thieves. The most enjoyable is when you realize your working as a team."

good,"Typical day at work was opening the store or closing. Surveilling the security cameras as well as writing reports, inventory, invoices and store deposits. Managing the store as well as co-workers and training. This job gave me the opportunity to grow in my work experience. Co-workers were helpful and consistent.The hardest part was the unscheduled call ins at last minutes. I did enjoy helping my customers find what they needed as well as putting a smile on their face."
good,"My typical day at work was to greet the customers as they walked through that door and make sure all there needs was fulfilled as they left. Working at family dollar thought me not only self dependability but to be a happy energetic person that also made my customer service beneficial. Management was very simple as I kept my shelves organized, aisles clean, and customers happy with any productive information. Co- workers I stood along side of were greatly valuable and effective for the job. The hardest part of the job I will say is that one customer that hasn't had the brightest day and needs a little more attention then others. But aside from that the most enjoyable part of the job is knowing you are doing something productive and making people happy."
good,my typical day at work is very productive. i have learned how use a cash register. the hardest part about my job was working the cash register for the first time .the most enjoyable part of the job is greetin g my customers

good,"A typical day at nike i would clock in and go see if the team before me left a note for me to do , regarding if i had to condense boxes , make space for new products that are to arrive on the truck.The hardest part of the job is when many things happen at once , on a busy day well get a truck with products but at the same time well have many customers ( store makes $100,000 daily ) that arrive and when were short of staff it becomes difficult.The most enjoyable part of nike is the family attitude we all have , i know my co-worker wouldnt let me down cuz if he/she does then we all suffer.All of my co-workers were hard workers and they all did their part to help out in whatever was needed for that day."
good,"My co-workers get the same treatment as me. The hardest part of the job is standing on your feet all day. The most enjoyable part is that you get to meet new people everyday. I try to make a point to learn at least one new thing everyday. One day I plan on going up the pyramid to a higher position, so I try and watch the things assistant/ store managers do."
good,"Excellent place to work for career oriented people. I learned so much about retail throughout the time I worked there.

good,"A typical day at work for me is a lot to do. If not, I'm always busy looking for something to do. I have twenty five years experience in retail. I learned almost all of training through Walmart. I feel as this was the best teacher I could ever have in my career. I started in retail in the back pricing freight then moved to a sales clerk position for about three yrs then was promoted to Dept. Mgr. Years later I went to work for Family Dollar. I was there six months and was promoted to Assistant Manager then eventually Store Mgr. I think the most enjoyable part of the job is being 100% instock and having what my customers want. I always enjoy seeing a smile on their face. Nine times out of ten they will return."
good,"This Company was a good to keep busy in I worked Stocking shelfs, cashier,"
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers, and providing excellant customer service."
good,"A day at work would be removing Family Dollar product from the conveyor line and, load onto a trailer at a fast and steady pace at all times. I've learned to work faster. That was something that was lacking in my work habits but, now it's much better. The management is good but, the co-workers need to improve on teamwork. The hardest part of the day is working in the summer-time. The most enjoyment about the job is they feed the workers every month."

I have learned a lot of interesting things from family dollar how to mange and apply myself to certain situations. My co-workers come and go i get along great with everyone i come in contact with my upper management play a big part in my day i am constantly communicating with them on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job by far i cant really specify but if i have to say it would be resets when the schematics have to be changed around. the most enjoyable part would be the traveling never knowing what to expect from any store i travel to.
good,The managers are ready and willing to teach you anything you want to learn. open to suggestions and new ideas. love to stay busy
good,"My typical night. I come in about 4pm. I make the start-up setup. See how many cases we can run in my department for a 10hour shift. Check emails. Then I run time details from the night before to see where we came in on hours and production. Start up meeting starts at 5:30pm. I do roll call go over are night before. Talk about some pointers for are night. Let team members know how many case we are doing for the night. Right know we have a-lot of new TM's, so i help with RF scanners. Then I walk all mods and non-con verifying housekeeping any other issues that may appear why in areas. For example a broken nose board on pallet causing pallet to be half way in aisle.

The pay was ok for the area I lived but the hours wasn't enough , I lost my home working there but I don't blame the job cause my manager was understanding .

There was a schedule for when vendors like Coca Cola and Frito Lay would come and I was responsible for checking them in and making sure we received the correct count of the product given. Stocking merchandise was also a big role when it came to the morning shift. Afternoon shifts (closing) was more focused on rearranging the store; along with switching cashiers, doing returns, supervising and etc.  Morning shifts was what I enjoyed the most, it was more of a fast pace and there was a lot more you can work on.

I didn't get to spend much time with my family due to maintaining a flexible, open schedule for more hours. The most enjoyable part of my job was always interacting with customers and hearing everyone's different life stories."
good,Family Dollar offers advancement to ANYONE who qualifies. This is the perfect place to build retail skills. Head managers are encouraged to create flexible schedules for the sake of their employees; a very considerate company they are. I would recommend this company to anyone.
good,I work five days and averaging 35 to 40 hours. Family Dollar always have opportunities to advance in the company depending on how much time one can invest in working.
good,I was a store manager for 7 years.i enjoyed my employees and low turn over. we all worked as a team. only thing I didn't like it was in a bad area. we were robbed twice. I had several great dms and helped in many other stores and learned a lot .the pay was great .I got a better job offer with the dollartree and now we are all family.
good,"It is really a good company to move on. Great place to learn and if you prove yourself, you can have good promotions from Cashier to Assistant Store Manager to Store Manager."
good,"Fun place to work strong bonds makes you feel like a family not just a worker"
good,"This job deals with handling money, merchandise sales, customer support/service, stocking, etc. Very nice job for someone attending school and looking to gain experience in the workplace"
good,"Fun place to work, There is a lot of job security, they have great benefits with employees, low pay but easy job to work at."
good,"very busy every day and stays productive, interact with a lot of different customers daily and constantly tasks and deadlines to complete"
good,"A typical day at this job is a little slow during the a little more fast towards the night shift. I've learned that even when customers are rude you still have to understnd how they feel even if you dont like it! Management here was good I never had any problems with the managers they trained well and did most of the stuff they were suppose to do. I almost never have problems with my co-workers, I always get along with them and most of the time the co-workers and I hang out outside of work. The hardest part of the job was the end of the night when you have alot of customers coming at the ending of the shift, but you eventually get use to it when you put your mind to it. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new things and getting to know the regular customers."
good,"Life with Family Dollar was consumed with clocking in. I enjoyed my job so I would show up early and leave late. Clock in on unscheduled days just to be apart of the everyday of Family Dollar. My typical work day would involve bank runs, verifying deposit slips, counting the money in the safe, unloading pallets, organizing the stock room, walking the floor of the store to make sure it is appealing to customers, and oversee my cashiers to make sure they are working efficiently and offer my help when needed. The most difficult part about my job was its toll it took on my home life. I was currently married at the time and I was more focus on savaging my store than my marriage which added to why I am divorce. My management role taught me how to function in a fast pace environment. Learning to make big decisions that not only affect me but my staff and sometimes even my customers. My supervisors were supportive to an extent. I look to them for ways to make better decisions concerning my staff. When I need a new perspective on handling insubordination I call in the big guns so that it never gets out of hand."
good,"I take pride in anything I do, I absolutely love my job. I love to learn new things that advance my thinking span. My coworkers say I overly love my job, they might be right. There isn't a hard part to my job I love it."
good,"Working at Family Dollar is rewarding in many ways. The focus on customer satisfaction is phenomenal. All employees ensure that all customers are properly taken care of so they continue to shop with us. District Managers are extremely helpful with any potential issues in stores. A normal work day includes running a cash register, stocking products, cleaning the store, and always taking care of the customer. I've learned excellent management skills and integral money handling techniques. I've learned the correct process of onboarding and termination. I have the patience and ability to train new employees and ensure successful inventory management. The most enjoyable part of my job is pleasing the customer. I can always tell when they are sincerely thankful for my help and, to me, that is a successful day at work. The hardest part of my job is just the stress. I love to work under stressful situations because I know that I am solely responsible for everything and I will do my best to get the job done."
good,"A typical day at work..i would unlock the store, retrieve the nightly envelope from the safe, and drive to the bank to make the deposit. when i returned i would open up the store, count both register drawers and enter them into the computer. after i was finished with all the morning paperwork, i would pull a cart from the stockroom and start stocking shelves. once i began to have customers i would do the stocking in between. my cashier usually was not scheduled to come in until about 4-5 hours later. once she would get on the clock i would normally stock and straighten the shelves. unless she needed me to handle a return or void. "
good,"At the Family Dollar, as an assistant manager, we have to open and close the store, make deposits, recover the store, run register, unload truck and put up the freight, do paper work, set new layouts, customer service. we have to be aware of the task of the cashier, which means we are to make sure the cashier is doing all that they are supposed to do. The hardest part of the job i would say is keeping the customers happy, sometimes even if you are as nice as possible the customer still leaves angry. Some people are just like that , but you have to be able to learn how to react to situations like that so that the situation does not get out of control. I personally love to work with people, i love to see customers leaving the store with smiles on their faces, When other people are happy it makes me happy. It is good to work in a good happy environment because then you will be happy. I have learned from experience that it the managers of a company seems to never be happy then their workers are never happy, and then the job at hand does not get completed properly, only because of the outcome of the environment,"
good,I really enjoy this job but the hours have been cut and its not paying enough for me at this point .
good,great store low prices many items to choose from nice works n great place to go for higene vitamins and cleaning supply
good,The company is growing and expanding. The upper management is very focused on employee development and growth. The District Manager are great and always willing to help.
good,"This is just a few of many job duties there are:"
good,"I've been with this company the longest, Very high paced in retail."
good,"While being Assistant manager at Family Dollar my daily tasks were very simple. I ran registers, cleaned the store, helped customers, did paperwork, watched for shoplifters, and stocked the store for sales."
good,Fun and energetic place to be. Learned a lot from DM and helpful life changes. ee were honest and reliable. Some days were a lil harder than others and customer theft was a big issue. always enjoyed going to work and working as a team to get tasks done.
good,"Meeting new folks everyday, great hours and employee discounts are wonderfull."
good,just got the customer out as quick as i can.the manager was good he work around my other job
good,For this job I got put in the register almost half of the time. I learned how to use the register and got pretty good at it with. Other things I learned were how to stock and unload truck every Wednesday. The manager was great with every single person and that made our job easier. the hardest part of the job was being slow because if you were slow in cashier your line would get really long and customers would start to complain. The most enjoyable part of that job was having good customer service because your whole job would just be really easy. The co-workers where really great.
good,"I enjoyed working at Family Dollar Store. Family Dollar Store was a nice clean, safe environmental company to work for. My co-workers was fun to work with."
good,"like working with the public-but didn't like the stress of being a store mgr-also too many hrs. the daily routine was little different. run registers-do orders -do cycle counts-do plannagrams.price changes-check in vendors. some of my co-workers were ok and some of them would just stand around and do nothing so I had to tell them to do there work. rather be an asst mgr instead of store mgr-didn't like the long hrs or working up 60 hrs a week -just want 30-40hrs and no more. at first loved working at family dollar-then they give you this small payroll you had to stick with and you didn't get anymore-most of the time you had to rush to get your work done that day sometimes I felt like I DIDN'T GET MUCH ACCOMPLISHED."
good,"Learned various details about how the store takes inventory."
good,I've worked for Family Dollar on 2 separate occasions over the last 3 1/2 years and both times under the same management. The employees are friendly and expectations are reasonable. The regular customers were amazing and knew us all by name.
good,It was a regular job just had some of the best people to work for nothing hard about working there everyday was wonderful. Inventory is usually a pain but this experience was fantastic I wouldn't change it for any other company's inventory time.
good,"A typical work day is like any other work day, busy, busy busy. I learned how to maintain inventory by stocking, zoning, and displaying the merchandise on the shelfs. The management were very percised about keeping the store clean, organized, and keeping good customer service. My co-workers were very nice, understandable, and very helpful when I needed it. The hardest part of the job was keeping crooks from stealing merchandise from the store and making sure they didn't come back. I enjoyed it when it came time to close and we can buy whatever we want from the store."
good,we had fun at work all the time even though we were busy. Always encouraging and helping one another
good,"Working at the hospital i learned what teamwork is really about, the people there are all so helpfull the employer is very compassionate for the employee as well as the patients. I learn to work at a fast pace."
good,"Provide customer service, Assign employees to specific duties, Direct and supervise employees, Enforce safety, health, and security rules, Hire, train, and evaluate personnel and Keep records."
good,Family is a big thing at Family Dollar. We knew we could talk to our manager about anything. Customers always told us how they loved our store for the smiles and kindness.
good,working at family dollar isnt a hard job. from the time you ge there from the time you leave all your skills are put to use.
good,Great place to work right when getting out of high school. Helps job skills widen and leads to higher job opportunities.
good,I learned to be very independent and cautious about what I do and say.Treating the customers with the respect that they would expect from us. Good customer service is always needed.
good,Working at family dollar I started off as a customer service rep about 2 months later I had the opportunity to become a assistant manager the process was hard but it was worth it. I had the opportunity to get 2 + weeks of training if need to learn everything about being a manager. They gave me more then enough experience.
good,It really wasn't anything special it was just kinda a job so not really anything to write home about just normal nothing at was that crazy just a job .
good,I am very wiling and hard worker and I am not a hard learner of there is something that I don't no i.am willing to learn how to do ythe position.it not a hard job
good,"A typical day at work was stocking and attending to customers in a timely manner. I learned to manage a team and get better with customer service.  The work place culture is great, everyone is like a family. The hardest part about the job is trying to please a customer who mind is already made up and isn't at ease. The most enjoyable part of the job is you don't have some one micro-managing you."
good,"Room for advancement within the company. Great pay raises with promotions, also has tuition reimbursements. I enjoyed working there the time I was with them."
good,Was a great place to work just needed better pay for the cost of living when i work for them in 1999-2005. I wish some of the store were still open in a lot of areas.
good,Always be on time and have a smile on your face thinkable everything positive throughout the day so you can keep being motivated. They were days when customers were not happy but I would always find the solution to their problems so they can leave happy from family Dollar That way they can tell the customers to go to that family dollars because they had a great experience. What keeps a company doing good well   Respect  EmployeeThat has good communication with the team I also memorize everything that every aisle had so if they ask I will know where to stand up without asking no one.
good,"The main thing is to make sure the customer is satisfied, clean store, friendly environment, quick learner, motivation, suggestive selling, promotable."
good,"I enjoy working there....I have been there almost 9 years, I seen a lot. I had a training manger for my manger for over 6 years she taught me a lot."
good,"very productive. it is stressful alot of times to handle customers theyre needs, portal project managers,truck, everything in between. it does keep you on your toes. But you stay busy at all times non stop the day will fly by quickly"
good,"Very productive and fun place.Learnt alot during my stay there.Its a quick paced and very productive environment."

good,Very 2place to work good manager's was my first time working by this company n I liked so much good hrs good pay n flexible schedule  n. Good benefits
good,Family Dollar is a good family orientated place to work and customer service is one of the best things there to do. I love what I do and going to work everyday is a good feeling.
good,I worked at a very small town store so it was never too busy. Easy to learn everything and the other associates were all managers. They were very easy to get along with.
good,My job experience at family dollar was interesting. I learned a lot of new things due to i never did human resource work. I loved the work environment but it's a lot of things they have to work on.Management does not work well together I went a full two weeks not receiving pay because they didn't know what manager was supposed to sign off my time sheets. I am just now receiving the two week pay which we got paid weekly. I enjoyed my coworkers they were friendly and we worked as a team. The hardest part of my job was not being able to do my job. Everyday I didn't have access to something that we needed to complete our job and would have to reach out to someone to complete the tasks. The most enjoyable part of my job was the friendly people and they always did things such as dinner and lunch to show there appreciation for our hard work.
good,"A typical day at work at family dollar would be enjoying the customers while working on things that needed to get done. The customers always made it fun to come to work and so did the employees. What i learned when i stepped up to be assistant manager was that nothing is impossible, if you believe in yourself. I learned how to take inventory, how to count the cash registers at the beginning and end of each day, and also learned how important it was to keep the store clean and recovered for all customers who chose to come into our store. All the co-workers grew into becoming a Family at the store, and we always worked together when we had tasks that needed to be done. The hardest part of my job was trying to show MY manager that i had what it took, to be only a step under him. It came with a lot of pressure and stress, but when i did everything on my own i felt accomplished and proved to not only myself but so many people that i could do it. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to serve customers with a smile, and always keep their visit happy. I loved when the same customers came in and always asked for me when they needed help. It showed me that i gave them a great experience when they were there and they want it again!!"
good,"This company makes it fun while at work. The work uniform makes  it feel more casual and laid back, but at the same time you have your structured jobs and assignments that everyone is supposed to perform. In a very short time you began to feel like you have a friend in your co-workers."
good,Family dollar really care about their employers. they do whats best for each and every employer. they have room for growth in the company.
good,Easy job almost as 1-2-3 nice co workers hard working managers organized business and environment hardest part of the job dealing with rude customers
good,"Productive work enviorment, effective team members. Hard working staff.Great customer service. Secure and safe working procedure. Maximized in management skills as well as in social skills with customers."
good,"I worked at Family Dollar for 12 1/2 years.  I worked my way up from Secretary to Executive Assistant.  A typical day for an Executive Assistant wasn't typical.  At any time there was different event occurring.  "
good,"A typical day would be serviceing the customer, making sure all emails were read and answered handled any problems thaqt arose, went to bank, put out product,cleaned store, set plan a grams, time management."
good,"Friendly, always greeted with smiles when walking through the doors. Experience handling money and helping customers, learned the store stock system, and got plenty of exercise."

good,"tons of opportunity. lovely place to work. always happy employees, never a dull moment."
good,"Before becoming an assistant manager I was a cashier, three months in the new company I got promoted to assistant manager and it was the best experience ever. I love to help customers out and maintain a store where people love to shop it and made very easy for them."
good,"Family dollar has made me more advanced in my customer service skills and attitude. I enjoy my coworkers company and seeing the customers happy and satisfied. Family Dollar is a good place to work. I enjoyed the time I was there. It was definitely hard work some days, but worth it in the end. I would recommend the job to anyone."
good,Love it absolutely nothing wrong with this job. It is a great working experience meet lots of new people. Im a people person. Love managing my team it is a great place to work plenty of oppurtunities to grow within the company
good,days were pretty much the same everyday depending on if you were opening or coming in mid-shift or closing the store. overall it was a good place to work at.
good,"guidelines:"
good,Family dollar promote from within which makes it a great place to advance your career it only took me 4 months of working there then I became an assistant manager so it’s great
good,"Loved Working At All Places , I Love Giving Good Customer Service & I Like The Manager Position.I Was Also A Cook & Stocker In The Jobs I Worked At Very Sastified."
good,"it was the best job I've had so far. I would love to work there again. It was laid back, fun, productive, and I was active most of the time. I was working cashier and stocker do I have stocking experience now."
good,Fast place to work. you meet all types of people. The pay now is great. you can move up from a stocker to a cashier to a door greeter to a manger or assit manger.
good,I learned to balance being a cashier while having to stock shelves another job where moving fast is a must being that staying busy is something I love to do it was a plus.
good,It was a great work place but the workers was not as one. One or two people can't run a store like that by there self. I loved working at Family Dollar and I also got a chance to experience management and I loved it.
good,Working with Family Dollar was one way for myself to get my foot in the door.  It was fun learning different ways on how a chained superstore really works from the inside and outside.
good,It was a temporary position. Overall it was a good job and I liked doing it. I got really good stoking and inventory skills that i could use to further my career.
good,Family dollar was a great job but you will have to be ready to work because you have to keep yo production up at all times. I learned how to be a better in harder worker at family dollar in it made me a better man in employee at work in to others.
good,"My typical day is making sure my customers come first as well as m y store is nice and clean for the customers. I have learned different types of way to help calm a angry customer down and as a manager i have the responsibility to make sure that my employees are doing their jobs to the best of their ability as well as mine the hardest part of my job is when my employees don't feel like doing their part of the job, and finally the most enjoyable part of my job is seeing a customer walk out the door happier then when they came in to my store."
good,"Open and Close store"
good,"cashiering was very fun, i learned great things with a very outgoing manager."
good,I wouldn't mind going back to work here I enjoyed tgr people I worked with and seen very open
good,Horrible management. runs the store different from most retail places. not a fun place to work. policies are horrible.
good,Wonderful first job enjoyed working with the staff. And the benefits were good seeing that I was only in High School.
good,"How To Recover Store And Clean"
good,"My day started with opening cleaning windows checking Isles counting my cash drawer,then once the store was opened i would start stocking shelves taking care of customers.I got along with all my co-workers we helped out each other talked and i learned alot from them on how certain procedures were exspected to be done, my boss was was good at teaching me about the store and how things ran but wen it came time to work he worked just as hard as the rest of us. My enjoyment about my job was the customers and knowin that they were satisfyed and got the help they needed their really wasnt anything hard about it, cause i love a good challenge. the thing that i dont understand though is why i was let go, i was given no reasonand that still bugs me to this day!"
good,"its an relax place to work. just not enough hours, are no pay raises. i enjoy the people. hardest part stocking. i would have stayed if i could have advnce in the company. The store i was working at did not give raises. after 3 months of my services. if i known they dont give pay raises dont think i would have stayed."
good,great co workers but management sucks each manager last about 2 months 
good,There need to have better management and GM working for them.
good,I really enjoyed working at family dollar. Especially interacting with the customers. They loved me and always wanted to know why I never had days off. Or when I was off they were sad because they didn’t have the same atmosphere when I wasn’t around. Overall my experience there was great just had a better paying position
good,Per My observe I was a challenge but I grow it to accomplishing it  no problem up til the district manage on me and couldn’ prove the situation but still he let me go
good,I enjoyed my job for many years but with every job things change and I believe it is just time to find something new. I learned very many skills I hope to use in a future job. I thoroughly love retail. It's not for everyone but it's my calling. I manage multiple employees and have made many friends along the way. I couldn't have asked for a better experience.
good,"Working at Family Dollar was an enjoyable experience but I would not re-apply to this job. I was hired to set up the store in Pittsfield, NH my home town, and the drive was desirable to say the least as it was just down the street so I walked, saving a lot of gas money, but it was a learning experience when I was helping to set up the store, but when the store opened there was nothing but poor attitudes, and a very upset manager. My co-workers didn't seem to enjoy the job at all and neither did I to be honest. I was hired on as an associate, but soon became the first assistant manager of the store. I really liked it for the first week until my senior manager started calling out and I had to stay, opening and closing the store every day, seven days a week. I was exhausted and extremely over worked. This went on for a months and finally corporate hired another employee with retail management experience. I became the store manager and she was my first assistant. It went well for several months and then she had to quit because of personal issues which left me again closing and opening the store. I sought out work elsewhere and eventually finding a better opportunity in the healthcare field for the Concord Regional VNA. That was three years ago since I worked at Family Dollar, and it seems like the store is doing better, but not as far as customer services goes. The last I heard they were going to close the store, but I cannot confirm that to be true."
good,The customers tend to make your job a tad bit hard but. I enjoyed my time with them.
good,opened and closed store waited on costumers stock shelves cleaned store
good,"It was a great experience working at family Dollar , ,the co-workers and management was responsible and kind , team work is whats required as well !!!"
good,Family Dollar is a great company but it treats its employees as though they are disposable instead of valuable. Some associate's like myself take pride in there work and that in itself is valuable.
good,Family Dollar is a great place to work. It's just not enough pay for all that you have to go thru with the customer's stealing and there isn't any one to protect you with the people wanting to rob the store. They want you to protect their merchandise but who is going to protect you
good,Is really not worth it working there unless you a manager the pay is not that good they want you to work crazy hours you really can't take a break bt is fun I guess
good,"A typical day is opening and closing the store, preparing deposits, stocking shelves, most importantly make sure our customers are happy."
good,"Not what i was hoping it was, extremely repetitive, and the only thing ever changing is how things are done on the company side or the customers coming in."
good,"There was a large difference of ages working there, but we all got along nicely.  Again, you get to see a lot of your regular folks and look forward to their next visit.  "
good,"Family Dollar is a good starting company to work with if it's your first time job in high school or do you just need a part time job with the laid-back atmosphere. There is a lot of steps that can go on in the store and you are responsible for catching and calling the cops if you find someone stealing, the downside is you are the only one on register and in store. Corporate needs to consider having three people in that store at all time instead of just one for the safety of everyone"
good,"I quit when offered better pay by a competitor 2 miles away. I have 15 years of retail and Food Service experience, the last eight of which I held a management position or title. Most often as general store manager or store operator. I have extensive knowledge of the day-to-day operations required to run a successful and profiting Retail store environment. The FD work environment was awful. The SM would never directly address me, if I made a mistake. She consistently would complain to other staff, who would then ""pass it along."" I would have loved to have been given the chance to run that store, properly. Just look at her turnover rate  too see what I mean."
good,I very much liked my job at Fd but I have kids an a husband. After 5yrs of working full time asst. manager. Came in when they needed me. Came in when snow on road. Worked when bossman didnt want to. Closed store just me by myself. It took over my life. My family needed me to. An I choose work over them because Fd paid bills. Fd only cares about their stores an merchandise. Not employees or customers. I enjoyed everyday at work making  customers smile and happy.
good,I learned a lot with this company.   A lot of organization skills and learned ways to be better structured and more efficient at my job.  I am a team player and love to help others.
good,They don’t offer benefits or full time hours. It’s hard to provide for my family. And advancement into management isn’t as said. I work hard all day for low pay with bare minimum of acknowledgment!
good,I would ask for help or asked where something went when I first started working there and I either got ignored or got told wrong. My Co workers did stuff that you aren't supposed to do and if I said something nothing would be done about it
good,the hard part of the job if i get it is have to deal with stupid people.no  matter what i would have fun until i can handle it no more. i will try and do my best and not get in trouble with the mangers. i have no problem of getting along with my co-workers unless they have a problem with me. don't like joules. joules are for people that should work.
good,It was great I meet alot of people . They have great oppurnity's an higher job placement.
good,"I learned how to manage, run and maintain a store. I learned how to use time management to work effectively and efficiently. Working with others taught me how to resolve issues with co workers and customers professionally. I had a lot of responsibility which taught me how to be a great manager. The hardest part of the job was just the balance between home and work. I enjoyed the customers I got to interact with and the ones that i built a relationship which by providing outstanding service to keep them happy and coming back for everything that they needed. "
good,Management on the other hand wasnt so much after a certain point. When i started i was promised a position i never got but instead i got over worked just for being a good working. The new manager was so stuck up he literally thinks he's better than eveyone.
good,It’s good to work for the company if management was on the same page as far as helping getting freight out and overall appearance of store to me a clean store is a friendly store
good,Being a family dollar family was fun and rewarding working with young people listening too them tell me about what careers they had in front of them. I feel i didn't get enough experience under the manager i worked fore. I would like to continue my training in L S A in giving the opportunity.
good,"Be nice when people are unkind. Be nice when people are judgmental, Being nice breaks barriers. Finding consistency/ Balance overall. Working together gets jobs done"
good,At Family Dollar I learn how to count down register at the end of shift and learn how to deal with customers on good are bad days. Working there was a good experiment
good,Store manager unfair made me do all of the work no one else wanted to do because he knew I would do it.  Always put most of the truck work on me too. I liked family dollar until everyone else got to slack off and I had to pick up there slack
good,"There is never a dull moment when you work for family dollar. your'e always on your feet helping customers or getting your job duties finished before the end of your shift."
good,it was a really good place to work at plus they let you make your schedule because they know life happens and you need a certain day off
good,"I absolutely loved what I did every day and the people I got to meet, but the employees and managers disappointed. The people I worked with at this particular Family Dollar store were rude, dishonest, and took advantage of one another. The customers that I got to know became regulars and I developed a bond with them. They were disappointed and sad to see me go and I only regret leaving them to people who only cared for themselves."
good,"Wednesdays where truck day. On truck day, I had to help unload the products and stalk. It was a good opportunity, because working on truck day taught me how to work hard. It was tough and challenging, but I worked through it. By going to work and helping customers everyday made my job fun and exciting. Some customers come in the store and make you laugh. It was a great experience."
good,i learn how to supervise employes. i learn how to open close deal with situration to the abilty that need to  be . deposit train others.the most enjoyable part of the job is teacher others wat i know 
good,Could use inprovement between upper management and employees
good,"Manage team, inventory also balance register at the end of each shift help customer  bring in item truck and stock the shelves  with the food and items"
good,I like it after all it wasn’t tht hard to adjust to the surrounding I do my job very well I’m looking for another job also because I’m in school right now
good,"Hard work, always enjoyed meeting new people everyday. Had to do a lot of inventory and stocking merchandise mostly alone, The work was never to much. Also enjoyed my co-workers and learned how to work a lot better with others. management was not the best but I still enjoyed working at family dollar!"
good,"overall it was a job,i learned how most importantly to deal with customer relations as well as training and developing people."
good,"If you love working g a high volume store this is the place , the public is awesome..you stay busy with stock and cashiering..but I love it ,if you love physical work , clean up ,"
good,I didn’t like working there because I wasn’t trained well and I didn’t get enough help when I first started and the managers was just sitting on there phones
good,I was a job were I could interact with people .I loved meeting people of all walks of earth and hearing about peoples lived and praying with the God loving people
good,It was just a day at work. I didn't really work. It wasn't a long drive. The people where nice  that I worked with.  She went around my boys job so I can work. The manager is nice.
good,Easy going down to earth people. Some were friendly some were rude. It was easy work and i made new friends. I knew a few of the workers so it was easy.
good,Easy work depends on how well you multitask. You may have to process freight and help customers find merchandise or ring up their purchases. Management was good and willing to help push the merchandise on the floor
good,"I lived my job at this store,there were a lot of unprofessional issues that where never going to be remedied unfortunately,so I had to leave the job.with great sadness"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting the customers with their shopping and putting a smile on their faces. However, the hardest part of the job was meeting the dead line of stocking the products on the shelf."
good,"a good day at family would be running a good shift.no stealing,no noe trying to be smart.no shortages on the safe the truck comes on time.and come the day it is suppose to come."
good,"i love what i do but my job was always left unnoticied. i learned how to make deposits for their company, the vibes were sometimes cool. oather times everyone was always in a bad mood. the hardest part about the job i say is when they would leave just 1 person in chage of the whole store and we couldnt even go to the restroom.."
good,Very nice company to work for and they will train you if need be. Clean stores and friendly service. I loved my job but had to quit due to personal reasons.
good,"an safe environment to work, don't care about the employees safety,and No security just unsafe place to work, wouldn't recommend no one to work there"
good,"A typical day at work was to greet and assist customer, along with putting out stock and recovering store.  I learned how to set plan-o-grams, do some paper work, and make change orders.  All of my co-workers had different duties and for the most part were hard workers.  The hardest part of my job was working far to many hours, I averaged between 50 and 60 hours a week for 3 months. The most enjoyable part for me was customer satisfaction and knowing that I had helped to make that happen."
good,"Respectful people. work well with others. a people person. Hard worker, also came to work on time."
good,"I gained a lot of experience working for Family Dollar. However, due to part time scheduling and low wages I sought better employment elsewhere. I learned to effectively engage customers, stock product reliably and manage cash transactions."
good,I like working with people so that was the good thing about working there. The one thing that I did not like about it was the hours working from 1 to 10 every day was not allowing me to spend time with my kids or do my school work
good,Working at Family Dollar was a great job it was just the pay that i didn’t really like about it plus I wasn’t getting enough hours working there and my checks where low especially at the fact that i was pregnant
good,Manager wanted to hire who she wanted disrespectful and very rude only one cashier working at all times just a sad place it could be better with better employees
good,Family Dollars really a great place to work for but with that glass/open door policy you basically have to walk around on egg shells depending upon your manager
good,This job was convenient and close to home. I loved stocking the shelves because it made my day go by faster while working. Only thing that bothered me was when if somebody did not come to work it was like they made you have to stay or you would get penalized.
good,"A typical day at family dollar. its definitely has no order at all. You deal with people stealing throwing bikes threw the window , pushing you threw doors getting threated everyday . being disrespected being cursed out because of my skin color. as a assistant manager I closed sometimes with females and we had no security. The management there could be way better . they communication sucks and they don't really listen to the store workers on how much we complain about problems they never got back to us about it. work place culture is different people. the hardest part about that job is they think we are super heroes and they want u to break our back and they don't even care about us . the most enjoyable thing about the job at family dollar is making the customers happy"
good,"Working for the company was decent experience, however my Store manager could've been a little bit more professional. The pay was fair, I enjoyed working with my coworkers. They all had ""team player"" mentality when it came to helping each other accomplish task."
good,Family dolllae is great place to work at but the pay will always be minimum. The customers can be very rude and the line to pay is never ending.......
good,"A typical day at work would be me coming in and starting to stock the shelfs. After stocking shelfs for a couple hours, I would face the products. I learned a lot of customer service skills her as well because of the location the store was in. Hardest part of the job was trying to keep  up with the thieves in the store. We had no security. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping people."
good,They need to give more hours but overall it a ok job to work. I don't like the the fact that you can't get insurance or paid vacation unless you are full time but won't give you full time hours. I love management but they need to let the manager run the job so it would be successful.
good,great working environment but I felt that the pay was not equating to the amount of work and sacrifice that the manger asked of the employees. I think it is a great company but the managers need to be considerate of the employees needs also
good,"It was a good temporary job wouldn't say make a carer out it but if your in,a bind and need some extra cash it would be a great opportunity to look into"
good,"When I first started, it was an amazing place to work. But after becoming under new management, the store was at a very tight theft rate and became more dangerous for the employees. The store manager was never there so it wasnt very life risking for her"
good,"Typically, your schedule is weekly.  You don't get it more than 1 week in advance.  No holiday, night time work adjustment, or any PTO for part time employees.  Not a living wage job."
good,"Customers where kind I had regulars who where great and faithful to my store. It was a very comforting job to work at. I would open the store count the money and do my daily reports on opening the store. Then i would lock up and go to the bank, and come back and start my day."
good,"Easy job, lousy pay, bosses are not cool. Easy stock job. Easy learning process. Fun co workers. Register was easy. Got robbed once, not fun."
good,"great place to work, the atmosphere is great, hours are part-time but you are willing to pick up extra hours from other stores as well as they pay for travel time from your home store to the next store."
good,It was a great place to work for just wish the pay was more.  A lot of work goes into this place just wish it was appreciated more.
good,"Meet new people every day, seeing the new products, seeing the results of working hard and making the store more appealing to others"
good,"Overall rating-I liked this job"
good,i learned that Family Dollar does not have the security resources that the employees of this company deserve.
good,"worked 8am - 8pm with 1 hr break"
good,"I've work at the same Family Dollar for almost two years, I started out as set-up crew, then promoted to cashier, and then six months ago I was promoted to assistant manager. However I noticed my store manager was doing things she shouldn't so I left the company, she would not let my transfer to another store."
good,"Working for family Dollar was a experience and growth. Customers was respectful. Co workers was team players and management was fair... "
good,I was assistant manager for family dollar in lakeland ga up till 2013 store closed the DM didn't offer me to transfer to another family dollar that was the only issue.
good,"I didn't like working here because the poor management, it was very unorganized , nobody was every on time  and the managers didn't want to work with the team members if there was issues in there personal lives."
good,"You don't  get a lot of hours. But the environment  is friendly  and the routines are essential  in any retail job . They preach flexibility  , so you learn the ins and outs of the job immediately.  If  the hours were better it would be a great place to prepare for upper management  in a bigger retail  store."
good,"Management is a poor reflection of the company, the management is lazy and incompetent,  as a assistant manager I did more than the manager did and that is not right..."
good,"Working at FH has been an overwhelmingly positive experience. From the beginning of my time here I’ve felt respected and valued as an employee. The pay, retirement and benefits are all very good, and the work is incredibly rewarding. Most of the people I’ve worked with thus far are very smart and talented, and genuinely care about the mission."
good,Yes it was a fun working experience I was able to learn a lot from working here management cashier customer service and I met a lot of people during this 10 years
good,the location I worked was very unprofessional. I left due to the lack of hours n the fact that a manager was always yelling and cursing in front of employees and customers.
good,Good pay horrible work load no payroll no time for family management is in and out very inconsistent cant hire my own assistants anymore  switching to dollar tree has made our company very unstable and inconsistent
good,good fast pace job for people who like to move around a lot  good hours every week never late at work it was enjoyable because I'm a peoples person. my manager understood their employees
good,"I enjoyed working at Family Dollar store it is a very comfortable place to work and get great experience. Working here is very interesting, you can learn something's"
good,My manager cut my hours when the holidays were over for a rehire some of some guy he knows. I had to make the decision I coud not take care of my children with 20 hours a week. I did not feel appreciated for the energy I put into the store. I brought sales up. Yet we have managers who steal or leave me in store alone during night shifts. It was not a good store for me to thrive in.
good,All employees are like a blended family. But everytime the door opens at night i automatically tense up. Please provide ample security for the high crime locations.
good,DOes not pay well. very busy on a regular basis. Company wants you to mult task but also have a quota to met. Manager is cool and works with you on certain situaiton but does not really care about personal situations.
good,Family door is a good store that was just going the poor management at the time the store was unclean there was long lines and the manager was very unprofessional
good,You get to meet new people and expirience different different things.  Its a fast paced job because if your a cashier you also have to stock and help customers.
good,It would have been nice if they offered benefits but the overall job experience was great. I met friendly customers and my coworkers were easy to get along with.
good,ran the store did orders and put up the truck it was a fun place to work and I had a really good manager she helped with everything that you needed help with
good,This location was not that productive. The management was rude and my main manager would sit in the back office the entire time I was working. She barely did anything. She never trained me on how to deal with a robbery if it happened either.
good,Clean work after every break area satisfy the customers by find the merchandise  stock selves when there is empty spaces setup displays . I enjoy working at family dollar. The team was awesome. We work at a time management being done the store was busy at certain hours. See the smile that the customer was statify with my service motivates me to go above and behond.
good,"I loved working for the company.  I loved supervising and training.  I believe being mgmt, we were not paid enough for what we did.  $8.25/hour after 2 years was not enough.  "
good,"run registers,stock, put out freight, straighten shelves, and recover store, take care of customers needs. Learned to be good at what I do, Management could have been better, co-workers mostly did their own thing and would run to tell others what you was/not doing, and like to cause trouble with others and management. That is the real reason why I quit to get away from all the gossip, and drama. I loved my job if it wasn't for the poor management I would still be there."
good,"This is a store that offers a lot of product that customers want.  I was in charge of front facing products on shelves, unloading trucks of inventory, and making sure sales went up.  I learned what can make sales go down and inventory walk out the door.  The most enjoyable part are the customers and to please them, helping them find exactly what they were looking for."
good,"felt like i was running the store by myself and manager was always there."
good,"I enjoyed the position held and the job responsibilities. Marketing, servicing the customers, completing tasks, winning contests, these were all very gratifying. The company however doesn't protect the employees from harm, and runs with 1 person in stores for 8 hour shifts. That is all the money allowed."
good,Family Dollar helped with work ethic it is a great place to learn how to deal with difficult people
good,"That ever again."
good,A typical day at family dollar was me starting at nine a.m. and customers coming in all day I would try my best to greet everybody that came through the door. If i had a customer who was having trouble finding something I would try and help. If it was something one of my customers didn't like I would do my best to fix it. I learned alot working for family dollar. I got along with my co-workers and management. The hardest part of my job was not getting breaks and the most enjoyable part was my customer and my dollar sore babies. Meaning the kids.
good,"I am working with good people, I improved my English because of contact with customer , I am hard worker, motivated, punctual and responsible. I enjoyed it"
good,"•Managed daily operations of a retail store, in an assistant role"
good,I liked working for family dollar it was a part time gig along with my full time employment at NCO. I love my team and manager.
good,The company needs better security and benefits.
good,i usually clock in and started blocking a restocking the shelves in the day time but early in the morning i usually unloaded the trucks.
good,"An ok work enviroment, with an irresponsible manager with an unsafe near a fire escape."
good,Family dollar is a nice store. People are great. Schedule in general really is not matching with my kids at this time. The pay is okay for what responsibilities that I have but they expect alot more. I dont feel that I will be able to advance at this time.
good,I like this company alot and Iam truly enjoying working there and my salary but I think it's getting about time I open my own little business to support my kids and I even more!!
good,Flexible with schedules always hours to work if needed ! It was truly a family everyone had each others back ! We all worked hard to keep everything clean and neat teamwork was very important when trucks came and we had to stock shelf’s ! The manager was very organized and genuinely cared about her workers !
good,"I had worked at 2 different Family Dollars. One I could never advance in, the second one i advanced to an assistant manager. The management at the second Family Dollar, was not very happy when I was working 2 jobs and I gave her my other schedule."
good,Good place to work pay could be better. Could use more benefits for part time workers could use better hours and should provide better management from higher up managers in the company.
good,It was ok to work their they just need to be more organized. The scheduling what's off. There were never enough employees working in the store an stuff was everywhere because there wasn't enough workers
good,"I loved working here from my crew to the customers, its just a friendly, happy work place. We made fun out of work. When it was time to crack down, we still smiled."
good,"I enjoy my job greatly but I do not enjoy the specific family dollar that I work. There is a lot of customer theft and fear of being robbed. Other than the neighborhood, I think I could excel in this company."
good,"I love being a cashier but at this particular location I just was not happy. First, the manager would have me to do things aside of my work description. I did not mind, however when she had a bad day she took her frustration out on everyone. There was alot of favortism going on here."
good,I loved working for this company. I worked at 3 different stores and each one followed the same guidelines. Some were faster paced than others but there was always something to do to keep busy. The people you work with and the customers that come into the store were always fun and there was never a day I did not want to go to work.
good,family dollar was a fun place. always work to do and plenty to keep you busy. worked there for 4 years or so and got to know alot of the customers  by name.
good,"nothing special to report on, regular duties of stocking and customer service, my particular manager was incompetent, proven by the fact that after i left the store fell apart and was closed"
good,"This was one of my first jobs that I had stayed at for a while about six months. The manager was very nice and helped out a lot with my schedule. She just was not honest and that was the only fault I experienced with her. "
good,"The work load for retail is maintainable. If you know what you’re doing when it comes to restocking and cash handling, this job is for you. Simple work. Your day usually consists of maintaining the register since customer intake on average is 15:10 (at least 15 people every 10 minutes). Other than that, your day will slow up and in that time you’ll recover the aisles."
good,Its a good work place to work.only thing dats not right is dat they dnt pay overtime rate after 40hrs.paid weekly.the breaks goes by fast it seems.manager n emplyees are good ppl.enjoyed working here.the only thing dat i didnt like was dat i never got paid for inceptive pay.like was said when i came aboard the company.
good,I loved working there coworkers was awesome.they kept you busy you was never bored .but they need to work on some mangement .The customers was so polite and patient.
good,"Nice part time job for one to have. I love the work environment, however the location isn't so great. Other than that it's a awesome job u can see all the sales first"
good,The placement of this specific Family Dollar store may not be in a great place but it is a great way to expand your knowledge of what other people go through everyday.
good,I enjoyed with the general public and working at Family dollars has been a great experience for me. I truly enjoyed being there as a employee.  I enjoyed putting on the customer's face as much as I could. The team I worked with were fun and focus on the task at hand. Family dollars help me to learned that I enjoyed working and helping people from all walks of life .
good,Family dollar is a good company but I could not get more hours. I needed more money to pay my bills and live on. Some of the perks are you get a discount on merchandise.
good,"Working at Family Dollar was a lot of fun. Working with my manager and co-workers has helped me with life. I have learned customer service more since working with them, and my cash handling experience has improved."
good,"Assisted customers with clothing sizes, house hold products."
good,"Always had a great day at work, customer's never complain about my work, and I have great people and communication skills."
good,"A typical day would constant of you greeting and assisting customers, recovering the store, & also checking merchandise. Normally on Thursday or Friday a truck will come and we had to unload it."
good,The job was great. The company and store procedures are very fun and easy to follow. I would normally work part time and on delivery days and time. Which would include loading a truck with about 900 to 1000 piece in a timely manner. The hardest part about the job was you are time when putting out freight . You have 10 minutes per repack box and 30 minutes per pallet. Its was fun being able to see all the new items arrival. The only thing that became an issue was that the manager at the time was taking personal issues outside of work into the work place and I felt as if I as not being treated fairly as the other employees.
good,"A typical day of work is to maybe open the store, open the safe and count the petty cash. set up registers an prepare the cash for daily use.  Check in different vendors, such as pepsi, coke, and others."
good,"great place to work, very busy days. unloading trucks was stressful way to many heavy boxes not enough help. the policy about only women worker was not so fair at all"
good,"I supervised employees, worked the register, did daily reports, deposits for store, kept track of petty cash and safe. I learned how to supervise, work with money, handle customer complaints. The hardest part of the job was supervising, because I was so young some of the employees took advantage of that and wouldn't do the duties I assigned them. I proved to them I was worthy of being an assistant manager."
good,"Really easy and fun, the customers were the best, really friendly and caring.I really miss working here, but at the end of the day they really don't care about you at all, my co workers was the best ever. I was in a really bad accident and was out of work for 3 months, they didn't give me my job back, I was really sad."
good,"Very fun place to work, alot of great opretunity there. I've learnd a lot about custmer service and it has help me become a better person as well as making me a better worker."
good,opening and closing register handling costumers. stocking product on shelf. mainting  stores cleaning as well.
good,It was good but every work place got problems. But overall I loved it the people loved me. I just was upset how I got let go.
good,A typical day at work would be productive i was always busy had something to do. Customers were great. Its nice to only work with a couple of people. the shifts were a bit crazy though.
good,"Working with register, bagging, helping customers. stocking"
good,"supervised cashier, stoked shelves,closing paperwork including deposit"
good,Family Dollar is a wonderful company. Not all locations adhere to the overall policies of the company.
good,"Very productive all the time, fast-paced. Manager was very cool and laid-back but the co-workers were very much into gossiping. I loved how flexible they were and convient."
good,I loved working for Family Dollar as it was great working with the community and being able to advance my skills in Sales . I hated having to move and leave my co workwrs
good,"I love the customers that I have met working for family dollar. They are very Kind. The management at the South Bend, Indiana Family Dollar on the corner of Olive and Lincoln was a bit to be desired. But overall, a decent job."
good,"The job itself is very easy. Greet the customers as they walk in, stock the shelves as needed, and clean the store. The pay is good as well, however, the dont give you enough hours."
good,There is room for improvement at the Company on being fair with giving employees a raise and working harder to help their manager succeed in making their store better and employees happy.
good,My time and experiebce i was grateful for however commute became a challenge therefore i gad to leave. My manager was very supportive.   The security was an issue.my suggestion for safety is to have an armed security at all times.
good,This job is a fun place with employees and customers..  Does jobs require teamwork no matter what And be a very flexible or your .. meaning Helping customers as well as teammates
good,Family dollar wasn't bad at all i enjoyed how close the location was from my house although my manger was very weird when it came to certain things especially how things were stocked.
good,"can get very bisy some days on trucks days come ready to be all over the store, some days you are doing more then your job title but with the right boos and the right respect working at family can be very fun and rewarding."
good,Great Place to work. Staff was helpful and supported working across teams which I did frequently! There are challenges in every job but I just looked at it as an opportunity to learn something new.
good,I am sure this was a great place to work the only thing that was the down side was my manager would try to pin all the employees against each other. After they left it was better
good,"I Loved It! The Customers, Stocking, Unloading Trucks, Bank Runs, It Was Fun. The Pay Just Is NOT Worth It. Plus A Chance For Advancement Is Rare. Its A Good Job Though."
good,My trainer took time with me. She showed me how to properly carry out each procedure before she supervised my hands on training. I appreciated that she let me take over and was there when I needed her at the end of my training.
good,fun busy people are always coming in never a time when you will be standing there with nothing to do employees are fun to be around customers makes it bettee
good,"A good company to work for as a long term opportunity. Just  be reliable and dependable. Work at a steady pace. If you're someone this company can count on, you can do well."
good,The company is great but my general experience working there was not all that pleasant. The store manager is insane rude and disrespectful. But all other workers there are amazing and very helpful.
good,I never had any issues at this company. It was a really good company to being employed at. I wish I would've never quit but with other situations in my life at the moment I had to.
good,Good place family oriented manegers are very nice ready to train and learn customer service is key and great they have training for registers and stocking
good,EVERY GOOD WORK PLACE. Hours are good as long as they is not a over crowded crew everybody was helpful and happy the schedule varied different every week.
good,Family dollar is an amazing job I have been working there for 3 years now they have help me overcome some fears I have had they believed in me and always have encouraging words they show that they actually care
good,I loved my job at Family Dollar.I started out as a cashier and became an asst manager.My coworkers were great.My hours were flexible to what I needed.
good,They let you work more hours if you want and they are very hands on with the work environment and they are very respectful to employees and customers .
good,I enjoyed working here but they have a high employee turnover also pay wasn’t worth the trouble manager was very nice and helpful but overall company didn’t seem to value their employees
good,loved being a manager there. the employees and manager of my store we all worked together and it was a fun and safe work environment also they trained me for advancement causing me to have greater experience in running a store .
good,I enjoyed working for family dollar. They helped me gain good costumers service experience. Family dollar also helped me be more social while working as a cashier and dealing with costumers one on one. Not mention they helped me gain 3 years of experience with retail.
good,"Time management is something you learn quickly whenever you need to run cash register and stock shelves simultaneously. The location I worked at is under new management since I've worked there, but at my time of hire, the manager was very caring and understanding about life happening. The workplace culture was being able to do your job while also being able to joke around with each other and customers. The hardest part of the job for me was being able to do everything I needed to do that day whenever we were busy. The most enjoyable was the interactions with customers."
good,This company was one of the best places I’ve ever worked. Days were long and the work was hard but everyone always pitched in when needed. Management here is great
good,"Even though I was there for a month due to me moving into a new state, doesn’t mean I didn’t like it. They had a very flexible schedule and great pay."
good,I was ok working at family dollar the pay not good and no benefit for the employees as well as not enough hrs for the managers get the hrs to much work for the pay
good,"Being able to help when a customer has trouble with downloading the smart app. Being able to show them step by step, while helping other customers, multi tasking. And the best part is that we all work as a team. And we get more stuff done."
good,"Really enjoyed being a CSR at Family Dollar and also a Assistant Manager. Also working for the company was a great experience, the manager was very nice"
good,Great job help me learn a lot  great pay great insurance  with within groups daily great boss . Better inside then outside. Management team was great to work with
good,"enjoyed working there, the employer was wonderful to work with and also the job place, never had a problem with anything as far as personal and job related"
good,I had a very good experience working for this company.  They were very flexible and took what you say seriously.  The customers are pretty nice as well.
good,"while working here I learned management skills including how to open and close store, how to supervise and motivate employees, and how to resolve customer and employee issues."
good,Could have better employers working. They all moved slowly and didnt know where anything goes. Everyone had a bad attitude. Always called in. Or would never show up intil manager was there.
good,Wonderful company great opportunities for growth. Wonderful experience with direct Intel on direction and experience. Awesome hours well the shifts that I worked
good,I have no complaints at this job loved everything Customer I love them the love me I’m a peoples person great personality great smile fast learner gear teacher
good,Was Okay At First Management Became Very Messy I Had To Leave . They Are A Good Line Of Buisness  Though . Very Good People Just Act As If In High School
good,This was a very easy duties I learned how to do things in a timely matter working here at family dollar. I’d believe my skills have improved from this opportunity
good,The hardest part of working at family dollar is dealing with the people who are in management/higher up positions. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know regular customers.
good,It was a great opportunity for me to commit myself to a team and do good work stay on time watch make sure everything clean and up-to-date this was a great experience for me
good,It was an awesome experience to have worked there the short time that i did. The staff was friendly and the enviroment was very relaxing and profossornial
good,When I first worked here it was not bad then it got bad I am unsure how it is now I was not thrilled about how things were handled hopefully they changed
good,"I learned a lot from family dollar from experiencing things I never thought i would to having fun. The hardest part of the job was trying to multitask while stocking products, also trying to deal with the thiefts. My coworkers and manager taught me and showed me how to work on things around work and how to get them done faster."
good,"I had a very good experience working at family dollar I learned a lot in management,  leadership, working  in groups overall learned how to maximize sales cycle counting exception counts opening closing etc .I learned pretty much all I need to to be successful in retail."
good,its a fair job. dont expect too much right away. mostly stocking and keeping the store clean and helping customers find their items. Emptying the truck is prob the hardest part is a store is small.
good,In every work place theres always going to have times where you have to buckle down for the whole team then theres times you would have a great team pull together. This motivated me to want my own store to run.
good,"It was a great job, I had a great team and manager, I have no complains about this company it was only my second job in customer service and I had little experience at the time."
good,I learned how to run a different type of register. I worked with great friendly people. I loved working with family dollar. I had an awesome boss. We done our jobs and went home

good,Working at Family Dollar was my first employment experience and it prepared and educated me on what it means to be a part of a team. I learned a lot working here.
good,"I enjoyed working for the company. I had room for advancement with in the store. I did have a problem with not enough hours actually, but in retail that is how it is. There are busy seasons and not so busy times. Managers where always there and the training was easy. If I would have stayed I could have went into Assistant / Management training program, however I had to move to a different county and couldn’t keep the my place of employment."

good,"The crew is amazing and fun to get along with. Only this job is a multitasking nightmare, there is a lot to keep on. If you can communicate well with the people around you. This job will be more then easy. It’s fast pace during rush hours where neither manager or cashier will move at all from registers for nearly 20 minutes."

good,"I was a cashier while in college and the entirety of my day was spent working alone. Before the original store manager relocated, she was amazing. After her they hired the worst manager I've come across and she was the only reason I left. I won't go into any details but she's no longer there. I was in charge of stocking the front of the store and the manager on duty stocked the rest of the store. It was an easy job but definitely negotiate your pay."

good,"This was one of the best family dollar stores that I had worked at.  The crew was a real team, and the manager was fair to everyone.  It was more like a family then a job.  Everyone did there share and the store was always neat and clean."
good,"Family Dollar has a horrible Holiday package and the fact that the distribution center is closing down and now I'm out of a job are the only two reasons that I don't like this place."

good,Family Dollar is very demanding and invades into your personal life do to their ability to staff appropriately but offers growth within company if willing to stick it out.
good,It's a good job I work there for a long time. It's  not wrong with working at Family Dollar Warehouse . I liked working there I wouldn't left if I wouldn't move.
good,"it was a cool place to work but the managers had their favorite workers, certain customers was steeling had to put back restock everyday certain people didn't wont to help"

Organize merchandise, and transfer merchandise from stockroom to sells floor. What I learned at this job was always be open minded to new ideas. I developed  skills and experience  in different ways. I also learned a great deal about handing customers.  High volume store with theft all day. Store was located in high crime area. Had a wall of no trespassing  with pictures of shoplifters. And on a daily basis being cussed out. BAD AREA!!!!"
good,The customers are always the highlight of the day. They make you feel like family your first day. You grow to love each and everyone of them as individuals.

good,"A day as an employee at Family Dollar. you would come in to work clock in and then the madness began. Stocking shelves with the products that came in on the truck, Helping the customers locate the items they are looking for, checking out the customers that are done shopping, Cleaning up the store (Sweeping, moping, putting items back where they belong, making sure the shelves look nice), Then counting down your drawer and making sure the deposit is correct.

good,It's a good place to work at I loved working there but the GM was really rude and mean and lazy I couldn't stand her but that was the only problem it's easy to work there.

good,"i enjoyed being a team member at family dollar. i recommend working  there its so easy and fun, well depending how you make it and the attitude you bring."
good,the managers were awesome and the customers were great some of the co workers and shift leaders were not. the hardest part of the job was basically like any job most co workers were not that nice.
good,"I enjoyed working there, my issue was lack of security and lack of upper management helping us with getting sufficient security in place. the manager and i both tried for over a year to get sufficient security in place to stop theft, with no results. So in return the entire crew was released due to high negative inventory numbers."
good,Gained cash handling skills and also it is a fun workplace. Dealing with different customers each day . Learning new things about customers is always fun and interesting .
good,Overall the job is very good for anyone but be careful of those who points fingers at you but not themselves I really love that job only if I had a support team5
good,"good experience, I learned a few things that can benefit me in the long run. good family feel..flexible scheduling...Can get busy really quickly...neighborhood friendly"
good,I loved working for this company. The district manager and regional manager are the reason why I quit. Their attitudes are what make people leave. I think that they need to open more positions for the stores so that planners and ads can be set properly.
good,Es bueno trabajo pero no te suben el sueldo todo es para los manager y los asistentes y se olvidan de los cajeros que existen
good,It was trying at times but a fun workplace. There was always something to be done and always new customers to meet. The pay wasn't great but the benefits were okay.

good,I enjoyed working at Family Dollar and my job was great. The customer's were not a problem at all! Management was amazing and so laid-back because everyone knew what they were suppose to be doing and did it without hesitation.
good,I often would enjoy my job and had no problems going to work and also being there.  Our management positions could have been better with more experience.  I'd have to say that that was the hardest part of my job is working under someone that had to ask me questions over and over again about their job.  The most enjoyable part were getting to know all of my customers and their likes and dislikes because you would have your regulars.  I'd have to say for the most part if Family Dollar would give me a chance I would definitely work for them again.
good,I enjoyed working for the people and with the people of this establishment. I left here hoping for better things but unfortunately in a small town that's near impossible.

good,"Morning evaluations, I was experienced with order pulling before entering the company, but I learned how to lead because the company was based on a production method, so I lead by example and my weekly production number showed and proved. Management came with an open door policy as all companies should. The culture was diverse and a great aspect of what the company stood for. Due to the experience, I didn't find the job hard in any aspect, but I actually found the place as an enjoyable employee friendly place. The company offered employee incentives for those that were dedicated to the work."

I really enjoy working with customers and meet great people from all different places getting to know them was a key to success I always used it as to my advantage for sales ."
good,"Everyday at work it is always work the carts in the back until you can't work anymore. Then it is rebuild this end cap, mark these clothes down or mark this whole u-boat down.Every Tuesday morning we had a truck to unload and put away and making sure that 75% was put up before we left.

The store itself is in a bad neighborhood, a lot of people came in and shoplifted causing two instances where the store had to be closed early."
good,"In general, I enjoyed my job of being the store and operations manager, however with too many restrictions.  One word of advice for the Regional VP of Operation, please treat  your store associate as valuable part of your frontline operation."
good,Working at family dollar you met a lot of different people and had different interactions. Its fast paced and effective. Coworkers are fun to work with and you get many hours.
good,"Be ready to work crazy hours and have crazy interesting days! Very fun, not for the thin-skinned nor lazy. To be successful at this job you have to be someone that is willing to go beyond the call of duty. It is a good part time or second job if you dont need a benefits package."
good,"I enjoyed working as an  Assistant Manager at Family Dollar.  It was.a lot of responsibilities but a great experience. I learned a lot about running a store and the ins  and outs.  I made the store orders, unloaded the trucks,and made sure the merchandise went to the floor.  It ended up being too many hours for the little money they paid. "
good,"what i learned is excellent social skills and multi tasking at ease."
good,Family dollar was a good job but the management was very poor.overall it was a good work experience and my staff members were easy to work with.the management could have been better
good,This place was not organized but very good place to work! Family oriented and the customers where always right! Overall good place and good neighborhood to work in!
good,"The last job I had was back in May I was working with family Dollar as a cashier/sales associate. But before that I worked at Penn pizza for three years, I was also a cashier. Back in 2009 I was working with Sears portrait studio"
good,"Everything about family Dollar was easy, comfortable and a great work experience, the reason I'm not employed with them anymore is because I gave birth to a child and now I am in need of more financial stability"
good,It was temporary but people I worked with was friendly and fun to be around didn't get to work wen the store opened we was building the store from the inside the shelves and  stocking products
good,"working at family dollar was a new experience for me especially because that would be my first time working in retail it is a fast paced environment, yo always working and on your feet.  i learned how to be better at mutitasking and handling difficult cutsomers."
good,"Very nice work place very nice people maintainable, i was the cashier ,the stocker and the truck unloader i had to answer the phone , take care money and cleaning was apart of it to , i became a manager in 4 months."
good,I loved everyone. Best job I had just the pay could be raised to atleast 9.50. I mean that would be fair. I mean management was consistent and careing towards their employers.
good,"Family Dollar is a great place for you to start coming out of high school and getting on your feet. Everyone is welcome in ,and great training coming abroad."
good,"On everyday I would unload trucks, check in vendors, as well as be a cashier. When working there is was a small store so everyone there was like a family and that was the best part about it. We all worked to together and got the job done."
good,Pretty good job for a college student. Can be awkward when people still and the beepers go off so you can't be scared to ask for the products back. I would suggest it to college freshmen.
good,This job was a new experience for me but I love retail and worked with very friendly and fun people. I had a lot of different job duties which gave me a new learning experience.
good,Family dollar was very productive always something to do and growth within the job. You learned something new all the time and the small store i worked at helped me a lot with management skills.
good,"Loved my job, but corporate doesnt give their managers enough budget for employees to work 40 hrs a week. was not able to make a living working here. compamy does not have benefits at all"
good,"as assistant store manager I helped the store manager with all procedures for properly running the store; payrole, inventory, register, interviewing, stocking shevles, customer and employee concerns, cleanliness, opening and closing. The job was enjoyable, and ruotine. Being in a small town there were many regulars which was always pleasant."
good,I loved my Job i ran  the store very nicely and kept it all about business. store was always clean and and in order the  team associates under me always did what i asked of them we collaborated very well together.
good,Loved working in the environment a lot of regular customers I miss. I learned a lot on how to meet customers need yet work in a friendly environment where I was trained by a super supervisor. There was always something to do to stay busy and learned some assistant manager training in the beginning.
good,A typical day involved stealing (which the customers did of course). it began to be a bit draining for me chasing after customers with the intend to retrieve company merchandise. Overall it was fun working with the small team that I did manage. Pay could have been better but and truck days with unloading company merchandise was a bit dread-ful and draining at time but I managed to over-come that obstacle.
good,"It was nice woking at this company, very flexible with your schedule and very understanding assistant managers. All employees were nice. It was a great learning experience."
good,It was a good job. I would work there again. I got a sense of accomplishment from working at that job. I would recommend anybody to get a job there. Thank you
good,"This location was rarely busy, which made it a fairly easy job as there was not much of a demand for hard work. I would greet customers upon entering the store as well as when they checked out or left. The first manager did not reflect the ideal image of what a team leader should be. They were never available and seemed like a placeholder for that position. When their replacement came in, they always complimented my hard work."
good,"I love working for family dollar. Only draw back to job is not enough hours, but the culture belief is great. The management is great. If the hours and the pay was better it would be the ideal job."
good,"Very stressful environment while enjoying customer service , meeting new people and working as team.  A typical day a work can be very busy with many task at hand."
good,it was ok at first. the company itself is great its the people that makes a job a bad place. Anyhting you do at an job never goes unnoticed because some of the biggest ppl are always watching.
good,A typical day at work consisted of handling a cash register properly and following safety procedures. You are expected to stock shelves when having free time so there is always something to do This job is a great choice to gain various skills needed in society.
good,"walk in clock in count the safe , prepared each cashier draws, reading the plans for the day and submit paperwork into the system .Writing schedules..."
good,family dollar is a good company i enjoyed my time working there i enjoyed my co workers.enjoyed the customers i have award from the customers in the community that was nice off them.
good,"i would come in everyday with the i love this job attitude , knew every customer by name made it a mission to be the best for this job. What i learned is that sometimes the best things in life are just the experience and the customers mostly my customers. My managers they were my teachers anything i wanted to learn they were willing to teach. i wasn't the average CSR i knew how to do things that other CSR's didn't know as long as you apply your self and do your best good things will always come."
good,"Cleaned store"
good,While I was the store manager I didn't have much help from upper management. They expect you to work wonders without assistance or advice
good,A typical work say would consist of me helping customer. I learned a lot of patience and how to work with a team. The hardest part about my job would be a unsatisfied costumer. The most enjoyable would be helping someone with no problem.
good,Family dollar is a very busy store and it is hard to keep employees because of this which makes work harder on other store clerks.
good,"typical days at work unload truck and throw freight, stock/face shelves help customers and run reg."
good,"A usual day would start with my immediate activation of the cash register & remaining at the post for the duration of my hours maintaining the floors, the products on the shelves, & discarding expired products. Ending the day entails sweeping the entire floor, closing the register, & making sure all products are reasonably displayed. I found it rather difficult pleasing my supervisors when it came to maintaining the shelves in as timely a manner as they expected, yet everything else about the job was easy enough to enjoy."
good,I loved working in this field because I love dealing with the sick and I loved making them feel like they were at their home away from home. I understood that this definitely wasn't a place that anyone would want to be on any given day so my main goal would be to try to make the patient as well as the family feel better and comfortable.
good,I am constantly using my customer service skills. I am always talking with customers and handling complaints or requests and questions. I work with warm and energetic co workers.
good,"Very nice coworkers, and you learn a good sense of customer service working in the retail industry."
good,I really enjoyed my customers. It always made my day to see them smile.
good,A great company to work for... amazing opportunites. I work with an amazing group of people. Family Dollar is very concerned about the team members.
good,"Because of my skill set, I was able to perform numerous tasks.  Being on register makes the day go by fast so that is the best part.  Stocking was easy, as long as you have a strategy, u can get it done efficiently.  i would also train the new employees."
good,Fun workplace and a great environment. The hardest part of the job is  sometimes you will have to do other peoples jobs as well. the most enjoyable part is that I get to be off in time to pick up my children from school daily.
good,"Family Dollar is a company. It's an average company. It does have it's flaws, you wont be living in a mansion or driving a Ferrari. It's Retail. Retail is tuff. You chose it. In retail, no matter where you go you will be working on holidays, you wont get overtime and if you are a manager you will work when you need to. It's Salary it is NOT supposed to be broken down by the hour. You sign a contract when they hire you. You know the procedure, policies and conditions.They give people the opportunity to move up."
good,I Learned a lot from working at Family Dollar. Such as proper Customer service skills and management. The hardest part of the job was we were almost always short handed. The most enjoyable part about the job was that I learned Everything Retail there.
good,A typical day at Family Dollar consisted of assisting costumers with and questions they may have and their checkout.
good,"Family Dollar provided me with a lot of experience and showed me the ropes of management.  I enjoyed most of my co-workers and learned a lot from them.  It was a lot of work being an assistant manager for such a small store, but it helped to shape me as a manager who could balance customer service, stocking, aiding cashiers, and learning new ways to handle multi-tasking."
good,its a ok place to work but dont make enough money and im not so sure i like to work for a job where you dont make enough money.
good,i learn alot on this company and i learn how to make schedules how to treat employees and customers you learn how to be responsible.
good,This job was a good job to have at the time because I was just really starting out of high school. good for someone who doesn't have a family to feed at home as far as the pay.
good,"Fun and exciting place to work. Friendly challenging staff working together to build displays and merchandise products to sale. Schematics or planograms are done in a timely manner, sometimes having to go beyond the call of duty to get the job done. Keeping up with the paperwork and maintaining a clean and organized work area."
good,we were all basically trained to know how to do just about everything in the store even as regular team member. we did not have job security we were the security. i remember this one night these two young women decided they wanted to take some glasses and a few other things and we watched them but by time the police came they were gone.
good,I enjoyed working with my co-workers. I enjoyed unloading the trucks.
good,"family dollar gives good benefits if you take them, they do work with your schedule if you would like to go to school. depending on the manager you can have a great experience."
good,I had a great experience working for this company although my manager was poor.
good,Meeting new people daily and becoming a family with your co workers
good,A typical day at work is fairly easy but you may have a few complanits from customers or staff.
good,"Working overnights in a busy environment was rewarding in several ways. In the same sense that my natural sleep schedule was way off, It made my availability duing the day to get things accomplished wide open. I love that the work was very physcial, it got me into shape very quickly and it made for time to pass fast! You pretty much work alone, in the position that I had, stocking, not much communication with coworkers. The way that most warehouses and distribution centers run, doesnt give employees much time off for personal/sick days or vacation. Unlike working in sales or customer service, you generally are able to swap shifts with a coworker if you needed particular time off, thats something you can not get with warehouse work.My biggest peeve with that position is that if someone called in, it was on you to make up for what would be their amount of the work that night, which would be almost impossible and made your shift very stressful. But leaving working, seeing tons of product off the stock decks and cleared out, leaves you feeling very much accomplished, and thats a great feeling! The compensation is usually pretty well off... but you deffinately earn it!"
good,loved working for family dollar until a friend of the managers was promoted in that store over me is still to this day (almost 3yrs later) more qualified
good,"I love my job, besides the different hours and bnot having a set schedule. I am hoping to advance with all the information that I have gaine from my co-wokers."
good,I opened and close the store. I made schedules and did the payroll. I got to help a lot of customers with purchases.
good,Had to Stock shelves during shift as well as manage the register and tend to customers. Enjoyed the Staff and the Customers. Was alot of Hard work but worth it .
good,"The company for the most part was fantastic, I love the co-workers, everyone at the Auburn location were very hard workers and friendly to everyone who walked through their doors. As for the company itselfs I'm not sure what they were like, If they are anything like the co-workers in Auburn then I would say they are great!"
good,"open and close store, deposit money, supervise up to 12 employees, shipment of over 1000 boxes, i have learned a lot about retail working at this job for 5 years especially when it comes to different customer service situations. the management team was very hard working and supportive, my co-workers made carters a great place to work they make you feel very welcome, the hardest part of the job was trying to get over 1000 boxes out on the floor during holidays. but the most enjoyable part of the job was working as a team to build a relationship with the customers to ensure every customer has a welcoming and enjoyable experience."
good,"Great management. Easy, fast paced retail job. My team worked very well together and were happy to do any tasks I put ahead of them as their Assistant Manager."
good,"People I work with"
good,"There are some good managers and assistant managers, but there are some who don’t try to do any work at all and would rather talk or goof around instead of doing their jobs, making the work load harder on the other employees."
good,"Never let anybody including managers in your draw. But other than that, the employees and managers was friendly and welcoming and the customers was very interesting"
good,I enjoyed doing my job and helping the customers when needed and waiting on them .My problem was with my manager that when I got sick and felt bad at work and was suppose to come in to cover for a few hours and be off by one she let another girl that was suppose to close that night get off at my time and had me stay til closing so that night when i left I didn't come back to work
good,I love working for family dollar I love everything about it but I personally do not like the hours because then there no decent amount of money the checks can only pay your phone bill and get you some food for the week that’s not bad at all but with kids it’s a struggle and I overall do not like the safety of family dollar
good,All the workers are friendly and get the work done on time. The manager is very understanding about situations that go on throughout the day. Overall a very decent job with pay better than most cashier jobs.
good,"As a Family Dollar Customer Service Representative you will be responsible for providing exceptional service to our customers. Key priorities include greeting customers, assisting them with selection of merchandise, completing transactions, and answering questions regarding the store and merchandise."
good,"Going to work was fun, you would have to enjoy people and love paper work. I got along with everyone that walked threw the door and I actually made the job a better place for customers."
good,Working at family dollar was pretty good the first month there i was promoted to assistant store manager for my enthusiasm and hard work. They gave me a two dollar raise and benefits .
good,Family Dollar is a fast paced environment and its awesome. I love customer service work and although there isn't much flexibility in the hours it is still probably my favorite place I have worked
good,We were always complimented on inventory as opposed to almost every other Dollar Tree in Nashville. Guests loved to come to our store and I loved to have it stocked and ready for them
good,I enjoyed my time there I loved what I did I alway enjoyed being apart of the team and helping assist customers and coworkers I always strive to go above and beyond
good,"typical cash handling and cash loan."

good,I’m passionate at work this what I know and love to do successful people do it everyday so should I until I reach my own personal succes level . I’m looking forward to working with good people
good,"I learned that if you work you willing to get the job done, it might be rude costumers but you respect them and help them with good positive energy. Hardest part about a job is dealing with rude/nasty people. But I enjoy working because you meet new people with good vibes and willing to keep you going every day"
good,"Felt welcomed as soon as I started. Easy to learn the work, can get promoted if you show good customer service and work ethic. Never feel intimidated ."
good,I loved my job. I loved the customers. I learned a lot. I have very high customer service standards. My customers wee awesome. I treated every  customer like  royalty.
good,"Overall Ok,We Took Brakes Like Usual  The Scheduling Was Okay ,The Environment Was Decent .The Pay Should Be A Little More But It Was Decent As  Well."
good,"Pretty Good job, Had great employees and taught many needed lessons. Teaches leadership and promotes confidence. Great understanding from management and other employees."
good,Loved working here was like my second home. Was a neighborhood store so we had a lot of regulars which made the day fun and go by fast lots of laughs n smiles
good,"Too much work, not enough employees.   The loading and unloading of all the freight, in the severe winter weather was very hard.   All freight in unloaded by hand."
good,The manager was horrible an wore her feeling in her shoulders. The security was terrible people stole from that store left an right. An they were very racist.
good,"Great job great co-workers very stressful  in out hours and pay rate very difficult the balance of work and home was very hard and stressful, they need to give more raises ."
good,"CSRs barely get 10 hours a week some weeks. realistically, the only way to be able to make ends meet if you have a family is to become management. The amount of labor allotted by the parent company is not very conducive to the tasks they expect to be done."
good,I work under Good working conditions and I have the best boss/manager ever. I've learned a lot here and I've greatly enjoy my work. My Co-workers are all great workers too so I'm not over worked.
good,A typical day would be ringing up customers and stocking shelves.  Going through our overstock to see if things fit in their normal places.  There is some light cleaning required.  I'd say the most enjoyable part of my job is the coworkers I get to work with.  The hardest part I would have to say is the last hour or so when things are really slow and you don't have any customers.
good,I enjoy working with people and the public.I love working for family dollars.the company is a great place to work for.Am real fast at taking care of the customers.
good,"I enjoy this job they care about their employee.   The customers become your friends and customers service keep your customers coming"
good,"Very organized place always trying to offer the best to the costumers. Open to the public on holidays with a good schedule, easy process for checkout."
good,"whatever comes on the truck has to be put on the shelves . its not something somebody has to say to you , you know it when u work at family dollar. stocking, customer service and recovery happens at family dollar"
good,my coworkers was friendly but I didn't make enough  for an apartment my manager was unfare and rude but It was always something to do so I was ok with that.
good,it is nice place to work but you work with the stressfully all time it is very hard to there but I like you don't have families time because the store manger live there
good,"I enjoyed working for Family Dollar. The longer I was employed with them the more depressed I got from working so many hours. Family Dollar never closes for Holidays. The store managers have too much responsibility and it becomes overwhelming, especially when it’s non stop."
good,"I enjoyed working for the company, more hours are needed and salary needs increase, benefits, vacations, sick days and a lot more. Other than that its really a job for teenagers that want a little cash in their pockets"
good,"Good start up company for management , or for start up manager learning, company offers great perks, contest and exciting fast Sales environment from upper management to Empoyess"
good,"Its a great start up job or job for the elderly looking to work. It's generally a quiet environment, besides families and there isn't  much energy spent unless your unloading truck."
good,when i worked their as assistant manager family dollar was very unorganized because our dm never pushed our store manager .you have to be a strong person to work here. and customer is always right
good,"Training :once I was hired  I had  A week of Cashier and Associate responsibilities"
good,"Be very fast when being a cashier, and you also have to have patience. Customers are more impatient if you don't meet their speed limit. With that being said the Customers are always right."
good,"You will have good days at work. The only time it might get heavy to you is on the truck days but its only till you get use to it and then its fine. The hardest part of the job is truck days and once you get familiar on how to handle those days, it wont be hard anymore."
good,I loved working there but I did come across some feisty customers. Everyone there got alone but I had an issue with one lady so I ended up leaving. Hours were great. Best thing was someone calling in and I got more hours
good,"Enjoyed working there.  Could get hectic, especially when trucks came in. Not enough hours in the day sometimes to complete all tasks.  Sometimes not able to take lunch break."
good,I love working for the company.I just need more pay. Im always on time. I'm a good worker.The job is not hard I just drop off freight to forklift drivers all day.
good,Had fun the time I was there we got alone we'll it was a good job I was a seals man  love too help people out my job was to fix the food on the Shelf keep the crew room clean floor mop in food update I had too leave my job because I had move
good,You cant be a full time mom and wife and work at family dollar managing unless your staff is a great team. The greater the team the better you want have to over stress and work more because the team member decided that they can't come in.
good,"What I've learned while working at Family Dollar as a cashier, was that you have to be a customer friendly person, patient. You're on your feet all the time and you also have to be a fast working while keeping in mind to be careful when working the cash register. You want to avoid things such as giving a customer incorrect change or maybe over scanning an item."
good,really well organized work place. the only bad thing was the location where it was located. the area was just bad. people would take stuff and walk out without paying.
good,"Working at Family Dollar is a Very Fast Pase. Always stocking shelves, products are stocked daily. Shifts are set at different times every day. The store stocks a wide variety of products."
good,I loved working here the pay just was to low.  Management was great was always busy i just was upset i was the ONLY one in the store getting paid 7.25
good,Maintain a clean and organized store. Keep a positive and professional attitude at all times. Handle and process all payment types. The only thing is not enougj pay.
good,"Great place to work, enjoy the team atomsphere. Hours are great and the building is well maintained. Leadership within the building is top notch and have great knowledge of the operation."
good,This job was good for a little while than management changed and we got a very strict manager that didn't treat people right half the time overall it was a decent job nice customers.
good,"I loved the people I worked with at Family Dollar, the work was different everyday and there was always something to keep me busy.  The downfall is dealing with upper management can at times be difficult."
good,"It's all about haveing a good staff, a great company to work for. Ive been there over 5yrs, it's all about, how can you do your job better. The benefits and bonuses are awesome."
good,Great places to work for good management laid back work style but follows rules clean. Places  would definitely work for again great customers upbeat place
good,nice place to work just dosent give many hours a week.if your looking to get manager skills or position this is the place to work for they promote good workers pretty fast.
good,This job had alot of stuff to do so I never got bored. You'd be doing 3 things at one time but was not very stressful. I loved it and I would recommend it to someone.
good,I worked here for a Year and the Job wasn't complicated. I Learned Quickly and was trained Well. The Atmosphere was Nice and you just have to be careful of your surroundings being this is a fast paced Atmosphere.
good,I want to work for a progressing company that I can grow with and add too and help grow even more while giving 110% of my heart sweat and tears in with every second of my time in!.
good,I enjoyed working at family dollar it just doesn't pay enough to support a family. I enjoyed changing mods and unloading trucks I enjoyed the people I worked with and modt of all I enjoyed my customers. Most were regulars!

good,I loved seen new people I was always friendly with them I always knew what they needed it or where everything was for them I multitask everything in this job.
good,"Long Hours, expect to be told you need to work a 52 hour minimum even though you will only be paid for 48 if in a Management position. Skeleton crews, management often working alone."
good,Cleaning Up And Ringing Up Coustmers. Coustmors Are Always Right No Matter What And Must Keep A Clean And Safe Inviorment.
good,"Cool advancement, nice people, true retail company, Awesome, Awesome Awesome, Great company, Great pay, Established, awesome customers, advancement, promotion from with in."
good,"I started at the Manager of the Family Dollar in Osceola, PA.  It was a very challenging job but I truly enjoyed it.  I managed several employees on a daily/weekly basis.  We as a store ran very smoothly and I feels as though a lot of that had to do with we felt like a family.  I have minimal turnover when it came to employees and my store was always on top when it came time for inventory.  My district manager was always pleased with the numbers I maintained when it came to any losses with the store."
good,Never had problems with coworkers or customers. couldnt get but 20 hrs. the worst part of Family$ was unloading del truck for 3hrs. best part was all my customers become like family to me.
good,Doing training was from a computer not from the Store manager and Assistant Manager. Every time we needed to do a training on the computer would take up time while working and on the register. Store manager gets yelled at because some staff were behind on there online training when they are short on staff. Stock rooms are always over crowded food gets expired shipment is every week and the District managers and fields specialist gets upset when stock is still on the floor. Training's needs to be mandatory for one on one and CEO's needs to make a better plan on distributing products to their industry. The pay for the amount of work that needs to be done is ridiculous.
good,the hardest part of this job may be either truck day or the hourly pay. It is a fun place to work and the interaction with the public is a true test
good,Limited chances for advancement. Good company to work for. Need a better work-life balance to keep managers motivated.
good,"My typical day at family dollar is good, i normally go about what im supposed to do that day, i have great co-workers to work with. The hardest part of the day would be when we are really slow and there is no one to talk with"
good,"I had fun working here because of the co-workers and bosses. The culture here was always a team effort and everybody pulled their weight and/or helped each other out daily. The hardest part was running a register and stocking at the same time. I learned about scheduling, stocking, cashier, and problem-solving."
good,Working here was a great experience for me because I have never been to Philadelphia before and for me to move there and only been there one week and got hired by this company was the best thing that has ever happened to me. I enjoyed my time working there.
good,"i made alot of friendships here, even with management, great place to work, fun, busy, teamwork. enjoyed going to work everyday"
good,"Responsible for customers needs, inventory, bank deposits and shift changes.  Also did the new employee training when needed.  "
good,"Oversee staff in proper operations for maximum retail; maintain control of store budget, inventory, and payroll.	Supervise operations and total maintenance of the facility including but not limited to security systems, logistics, weather related conditions, etc."
good,"A typical day at work consists of stocking and providing customer service. I learned how to stock, dispose, and keep a clean environment. I also learned how to run a cash register. The management at Family Dollar was unfair, and unreasonable. My co-workers were easy going, and easy to work with. There is no hard part about this job. The most enjojable part about this job is the flexible hours."
good,"I stocked, and held four keys to four stores. I opened and closed. I went to other stores to help when it was needed. I  took care of money management."
good,"Great place to work everyone is so kind and respectful care about you finding what you need, the managers are helpful and they want to see you succeed"
good,easy work schedule while I was in school had a very good manager easy work duties coworkers were nice easy to learn how to do the work very good environment hardest part of the job were the customers the enjoyable part was getting off of work
good,"Good loving place to work, if you want 40 hours a week though its not the job for you."
good,it was my first real management position. i learned that daily routines are very important to a work place and that knowing how to delegate is a much needed skills that I've perfected. i would say the hardest part of the day was dealing with an irate consumer and making sure that person/s left my site satisfied.
good,"Train newly hired cashiers, assist with daily  cashier duties, general frontend supervision and customer service for the overall goal of customer satisfaction for the Family Dollar Store family."
good,Work with kids by playing sports and teaching the value of team work and how team work works in everyday life
good,"This was a temporary on-campus job that supplied me with personal funds in addition to furthering my education. After class, we were required to administer tests to new students as well as online students and/or students who were taking exams to replace a course. I never knew that there were exams available that could be taken to replace an entire course. It was a very relaxed environment that allowed me to work and maintain my studies. The hardest part of the job would be informing a student that they did not pass the exam.  However, the way you relay potentially disappointing information to a person makes a world of difference. The most enjoyable part was my ability to meet and greet new students daily."
good,"-A Typical work day included ensuring customer transactions were processed promptly and accurately. I generated cash related documents, maintained checkout areas by confirming they were clean, safe and organized"
good,Great Company to work for and fun people/employees. Learned a lot of skills when it comes to managing a store or branch of a company.
good,"typical work day that a family dollar store in Dewitt, Iowa was.. "
good,"Since I have been working here, I have learned how to work retail very well. My other jobs have been warehouses and airport ramps, so this has been great for experience. I just don't get paid enough for it."
good,"A typical work day I would cash out multiple customers, answer customers questions and help them find products they are looking for. I have to keep my work area clean and make sure products are in correct places with proper pricing. Make sure products are stocked, if not enough are on the floor I have to pull some from the back room, if we have more. You basically do it all at this job. But you don't have a set of keys. It is hard to communicate with management there is no proper way to call someone to the front end. We currently use a desk bell that no one can hear from the back of the store. I absolutely love my co-workers. We are like a little family, there is only 6 people in our building."

If you are the cashier, then the manager will go with you to get a loan ( count the drawer that your are assigned to). No one else is to cash out on your drawer.

good,"Working for Family Dollar was pretty cool, especially for a college student. I was hired as an assistant manager, despite having no prior management experience. However, the management who were above me as well as the coworkers at that store were extremely lazy, and a few of them stole and broke rules often. When I spoke up, I was bullied and tormented. I asked the regional manager to be transferred to another store, and he ignored me so I left the company and never looked back. Certainly was not worth 10 measly dollars an hour."

We had a pretty cool environment. Our manager… she was a cool lady, too.Well, depending on the time of the month, it could be extremely slow where we wouldn’t even be at the register much. We were just constantly backing stuff and restocking. Or it could be one of those days where it’s just… you have people coming in and buying just everything, from holiday stuff to household supplies.

I made lots of friends and learned a lot at this job such as how to work at a cash register and how to stock product correctly as well as rotate product. Moreover, as a cashier I greeted the customers as they came into the store. Working at family dollar taught me how to work in an efficient manner and I got really good at it. Whenever it was time for a raise we always got a raise and our hard work was noticed."
good,I loved working for them it was a good experience  it was a fast paced work place great business great service I actually always made it in on time every day.
good,Very very fast paced. I feel like I am always doing something wrong and always slowing others down. I feel like I am not catching on at all. I don’t feel like I will make it...
good,Fast paced work environment never really a lot of down time other than breaks but theirs always something to be done but poor management can hurt the moral of the work crew
good,"Stock shelves, run the cash register, pretty laid back as long as you are able to get your work done. Truck day was a bit stressful as you had to unload the truck and then stock all the new products that needed to be put on the floor but it could be fun at the same time."
good,"Love working with the public. Lot's of challenges and team work.  Work day is never the same. Each day brings new and interesting customers.  Always busy, never a full moment."
good,Most days you try to keep up or push yourself into over doing your limits. Most weeks there are huge trucks especially with holidays. The stores are usually too small to fit half of the deliveries.
good,Probably my favorite job. All the staff got along as family. There is always something to be done to make time pass. Don't get paid very much but its easy work
good,Family Dollar was an experience. Being my first factory job I had to catch on quick. Job satisfactory must be kept to a standard to provide a consistent workflow.

good,a typical day at family dollar consisted of opening and counting out registers. stocking shelves unloading the delivery truck once a week. ringing in customers purcheses  and at the end of the day closing out the registers cleaning up and locking up the store.
good,"the company was a great fit when i lost my home in a tornado on march 2, 2012 they were very understanding and helped us with the process of many different things."
good,Providing customer service and handling cash transactions including credit/debit and checks. keeping a clean and safe store. Custumer serviced providing. Family dollar is a place where you can advance your career in customer service. Overall i enjoyed working for them.
good,This position required us to be somewhat knowleadgeable about the products and product placement in the store. It was technically my first position and a good place to start. I had an amazing team to work with and management was quite agreeable on most subjects. I enjoyed the experience and was sad to see it end.
good,"Working at Family Dollar is a challenge, mixing stocking shelves with ringing up purchases and recovering the store. It is fast-paced, and requires  a bit of diplomatic skill in handling irate customers."
good,"I enjoyed my two years there. "
good,Loved working at Family Dollar. Wish I didn't have to leave there but due to circumstances I had to. Very friendly people there and very understanding. Met some nice people other people not so much. Very polite staff there.
good,I really enjoyed working for this company. I've had prior experience in retail so it really was a piece of cake.Management so really helpful. The hardest part was having to leave because they wanted me to relocate.The most enjoyable part was when I use to compete with my supervisor on how many snickers i could sell on my shift.
good,I very much enjoyed my experience at Family Dollar. I would recommend as well as return their if the opportunity arises. The work was rewarding and the team was generally overall a pleasure to work with.
good,Working there if u needed extra hours it was very easy to get them. The only draw back is saw was that while working there we had a high turn over rate which caused a stressful environment at times.
good,"Overall, family dollar was a great place to work and the employees worked together to get the jobs done on a professional level. Customer satisfaction was the main objective (keeping them happy and making sure that everything was in stock). The challenges of the job was rewarding because it kept us on our toes on a day to day basis."
good,Family dollars is a good place to work the bad thing is that they play with your hours too much not enough for you to pay your bills...good management good costumers
good,Working at family dollar was very productive and strictly about work. On a day to day basis all work was done and the store was cleaned. Being late and calling out was rarely tolerated . Family dollar store 60201 worked as a family
good,Fun.never boring there's always something to do and customer are great. Once your in contact with customers everyone knows your name and you see them on a regular basis

good,"I loved almost everything about this company while working for family dollar. I was a floating assistant manager that went to alot of different stores to work at while the managers were either away on vacations, dr leaves, or just needed personal time off."
good,I literally ran the store and supervised the employees. Manger was very understanding about family and family demands. I was able to work around my family and my children's schooling.  The pay was low but I was close to the house so it did not hurt. I wished they had had vision insurance. My manger showed me that people and co-workers could be mentors and even friends. The least favorite part of my job was coming in at 6 am to unload truck.
good,"This company as a few more cons than pros because of how difficult it was. Though the hours were decent, the pay was not worth all the troubles and cleaning I went through."
good,I loved my customers here and even though I no longer work for the company I still have customers who recognize me and say hello.  I also loved the fast paced routine I had everyday.
good,i absolutely loved working for family dollar i advanced quickly and the management was wonderful and the customers were great. if the pay was enough i would go back
good,I loved the job just my manager was old and had memory issues. He changed the schedule and wouldnt let anyone know. Then he would want to write you up for not coming in. We had to take pictures of the schedule every day we worked.
good,"Organized, clean environment"
good,Family dollar was a good but it was challenging do to the customer service you have to have a positive attitude every day do to bad attitude thats comes from customers but i made it work do to my people person attitude.
good,Its a great environment. Always meeting new people some interesting and some could be rude but as long as you let them know your their to help with any kind of assistance they usually walk out content.
good,"I enjoyed working for the company I was freight manager, being that i like tow orkout it helped keep me fit and the customers loved to come by just to see me because i am friendly and inviting and aim to please them in anyway that i could"

good,It wasn't really that much to do if there wasn't a lot of customers. I got along with my coworkers and my supervisor. The environment was productive and calm.
good,Great place to work friendly employees fast pace environment paid holidays and vacation paid breaks and lunch special dinners and discounts and just a fun place to work
good,Easy fun work. Holidays was stressful but overall great place.  Management was great. The only reason I left was it was an hour drive to work. Pay was low so it just wasn't a good fit for me at the time.
good,Very fast paced work place but it also can be very stressful if you're the only one in the register. And you may have to ask for breaks because they don't really say anything about them.
good,You got to stay busy all the time. Favorite customers that would wait for you to cash them out than getting out of there quickly. Tagging clothes and getting first dibs on anything.
good,overall need better management. Friendly customers.. Great working space.. Great workers/team work.. Flexible schedule.. safe environment.. Great communication
good,"A regular day at work looks like coming in for 8 am, hanging up clothes in hangers, putting away stocks, and ringing out costumers. Most times Im there until 4, or if they need someone to stay extra time Id stay until 11 at night. At the end of each night Ill sweep and mop the floors and wipe down the counter tops."
good,Family Dollar is a great company with a great culture. The worklife balance was good and the people made teh work experience fun. I would defintiely recommend this company to anyone interested.
good,"This is a great place for someone who enjoys customer service. You can move up in this company fast if you put in the work. "
good,When you first get there you need to clock in and then count thee money in the register. You are able to start off your day. My manager or assistant manager would let me know what I would need to put away or fix for that day.
good,"You need to be flexible, fast paced and energetic. Its fun, the customers are always nice and the employees are great. You need to be able to multi-task."
good,I loved my boss she's the best I love working with my team members job was fun work was great my boss always worked with us if we needed help she was a good boss
good,I liked working at family dollar you get to meet new people everyday some time you get to know the regular customers that come in all the time by name
good,"Family Dollar is the place to work if you like working with people and creating connections with your co-workers. I thoroughly enjoy being around my co-workers and helping out around the store. While i am a CSR, I am not very fond of being on the register all day which due to scheduling happens very often, but my co-workers and I all watch out for each other so as long as someone else is working with you, you get a break."
good,"I worked in a very busy community ie., school districts, food restaurant jobs, factories, auto shops, I was able to help serve a community in which my store held products for. I also stayed busy by working the weekly trucks to stock the store as well as manage other employees."
good,"I really enjoy working here,we have become somewhat a little family I love my customers as well as my coworkers.I never hesitate when they ask me to come in to help out."
good,"A typical at Family Dollar was good. We take of the customer that came in as well as bonded with most customer because it's a friendly place. I learned how deal with money very well as well as make nightly deposits. Also more computer that I didn't already know. There really was nothing hard about my job as a manager there. I enjoyed everything about the job. Management was awesome because I was one of them,"
good,"Since I was an Assistant Store Manager for this company I really did not have a typical work day verbatim. Some days I would have to do inventory cycle counts on merchandise, other days would consist on restocking shelves, and doing paper work. I was also responsible for training and managing Customer Service Representatives. What I learned from this company over the years is that great customer service is what will keep customers coming back to buy which will lead to great store profit. The Management above me at times did not handle business with lower management professionally. The hardest part of the job was learning how to handle aggressive customers in a professional manner and help them solve problems that they had concerning the store. The most enjoyable part of the job was training and mentoring Customer service representatives to become better and move up in the company."
good,"I enjoyed this job not only did I learn to be a manager and I  met some of the greatest people. I learned about truck orders, inventory count importance."
good,"My day consisted of spreadsheets on the computer, making sure Incoming and Outgoing products was being done in a timely manner. I had a great relationship with my co-workers and with my Supervisors. We also had a holds spreadsheet which was a big part of my job, I had to try to get the products off hold to move in and out of the distribution center, which was tough because you are working with Vendors to have actions to do so! I thoroughly enjoyed my job, was sad when I left to pursue another opportunity."

good,"loved the job.. i just wish she could of gave me more hours so that it was worth the gas and worth paying a babysitter, i would of stayed. A Typical day at work was decent and most of the time busy."
good,"Staying busy with something all the time. Working in the stores are very fast past. The company is changeing due to dollar tree merge..  Example payroll changes, and being payed every two weeks"
good,Very fast paced work place throughout the day. some times the customers get irate and agitated. Its a good job overall but am looking for something better.
good,"Very welcoming and nice and neat, everything is in order were it need to be, kept clean through out the day. Helpful when questions were asked .Only hard part of the job was sometimes the rude customers."
good,"I enjoy working with the public, greeting your customers, handling all money transaction, light cleaning around your register, always be to work on time that's a plus"
good,"A typical day at work starts by making sure the store's aisles are in tact. Meaning each item is in its correct place as well as being stacked neatly. Working at Family Dollar I learned that there are a lot of different personalities,that need to work in cohesion in order for a business to run efficiently. Family Dollar's management is tremendous they understand that their employees' have situations at home and will schedule around your home difficulties to accommodate you. The culture of Family Dollar is very fun spirited everybody gets along being respectful to others as well as being able to joke with one another. There is no part of the job that is overly challenging or complicated. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to interact with my co-works. Along with interacting the customers they always seem to be kind hearted and in a good mood."
good,"My typical work was working with customers of every race, it was very nice to get to know everyone and getting to know everyone's needs or what they want. However, if you're not a person that can't handle rude people that may be hard. I found it easy because you never know what kind of day the customer is having."
good,"I loved working for Family dollar.  I learned many different things working for this company, i worked my way up from a cashier to a assistant manager within 2 months of time.  The hardest part of the job was being short staff but we still managed to always pull through.  The most enjoyable part of this job was the many opportunities it gives you to grow."
good,My co-workers were great but the environment was not the greatest place I would like to be. I only quit because of how uncomfortable I was working nights.
good,Greeting and checking out customers. Keeping shelves stocked and organized.Keeping stockroom organized and stocked accordingly. The hardest part was closing time and turning people away.
good,"My manager was a really friendly guy, who loved to keep his store well organized and clean. I learned great skills in customer service, while keeping on top of multiple tasks throughout the day. These tasks included stocking shelves, making sure my area was well cleaned and organized at all times, assisting customers, and handling money."
good,"morning cashier so made sure customers were greeted and offered my help, keeping the front end of the store keeping my area of the store shelves stocked and priced right, just doing anything I could to get the job done as well as making sure our customers felt welcome and the keep coming back"
good,"Excellent management- When you need help with everyday task you will not punished or ignored."
good,I have been a assistant manager and a cashier for the company for a year now. I enjoy the customer and the hustle of the work.
good,"The managers were very supportive and understanding to my needs and other associates on the job and they always let me know ahead of time if they needed me to help out at another store. I think Family Dollar was a wonderful place to work, competitive people, high speed job with competitive rewards and benefits..."
good,Its a fun place to work and i learned a lot since I've been there. Management was easy to work with and always willing to teach.
good,"enjoyed working there meeting new people but the manager she was unprofessional. i enjoyed my job but the manager she was ridiculous."
good,"clock in. loan on. clean behind and around check out. recover front of store. work freight, and overstock. straighten around sales floor and help customers."
good,I did enjoyed working there because you get to meet a lot of fun people. And at the same time you learn different skills like being a manger.
good,Very fun environment. extremely underpayed. expected to do way more in the time you are there then what is possible. district manager didn't carea bout the inappropriate harassment there store manager was doing to the female cashiers
good,"This company could be excellent however they lack leadership conducive to a productive environment. The managers lack product rotation knowledge for food items, as well as basic sanitation needs of a retail store"
good,"first task of the day ,i would inspect and count my register.daily job duties are to help stock shelf's, walk floor and add additional merchandise when needed.sweep and mop floors, assist customers."
good,Small stores so it's easy to learn the products fast and sales only bad thing is there will only be 1 cashier and an assistant manager on duty even closing so the store has to be cleaned only by them two but you do get out by 1030 pm.
good,"Excellent employer, positions availably, works around any schudule, benefits & long term retirement, 401K benefits,  cashier associate moved up to assistant manager after 90 days probation with company, relocated to Midland, Texas Area as a Store Manager"
good,very good customer service. The best part is making sure that all the customers get everything that that need andgetting the questions asked

good,I really didnt like working their because you had to constantly look out for theives and some of them even tried to fight you.
good,Everyday was filled with many opportunities to gain a lot of knowledge within the company it expanded my knowledge as a retail worker and i enjoyed it very much
good,"Helping customer showing them where thing are.  Seeing them smile cause you help they. Or when Customer ask where were you on your a off.   Being a Asst. Manager got to learn a lot,"
good,"on a average day, expect the craziest things to happen. customer gets caught stealing, a customer argue down a employee about a price on the merchandise, or your manager getting on to you about an error you have made."
good,"Relax and do your job despite the disturbance and other stuff that would easily make you lose your concentration. Once you have lost your concentration, things start to fall apart, leading to a bad day. I like being organized and having a routine helps a lot , but also thinking out of the box takes it to a different level, where you can grown as and individual and with the company. Communication is really important for me and it helps to have it with your co-worker for an enjoyable day."
good,"overall fair work place. leaders such as SM, DM, and GM, etc are very hands off about their jobs and offer little to no help when you actually have a work related issue. you fend for yourself most times if it doesnt involve basic aspects of the job. on a plus side you have an opportunity to work at a calm and friendly work environment. the work itself is straightforward and isnt very difficult if you apply yourself diligently."
good,Not very fast pace place. Very easy job. Cashiering was my favorite part along with unloading stock. Still able to meet new people.
good,"i enjoyed working here my co-worlers were very friendly, and my manager was always willing to explain every detail when i needed help doing a task"
good,"Customer service along with cashiering, working fright from truck to stocking shelves, working with co-workers to get needed projects done.  Hardest part of the job was working all freight, the lifting and stocking of shelves.  Always having a great attitude and in a good mood, no matter the problems arising."

good,Its a great company to work for. I love dealing with different types of people. Getting to know more people really helps me with my customer service skills.
good,Great temp position. I enjoyed watching the company expand to the west coast and learned alot about what hard work actually goes in to opening a brand new store. The most enjoyable part of my job was stocking and doing the product displays for the floor.

good,"4 hr shift"
good,Multi-faceted place to work that required cashiering as well as constant stocking.  Nice understanding manager
good,"Family Dollar is a great working Experience, great coworkers"
good,Its a good place to work that isn't fast-paced. Get paid every week which is good. But nothing really change much unless its seasonal and the routine is daily work is the same everyday. It really does make you feel apart of a team and a family.
good,"It was ok."
good,"I opened the store most days, set up registers, did paperwork from the day before, took the deposit to the bank and picked up change order for the day, pulled stock from the back room to fill shelves, organized the back room for truck delivery, and made sure store was clean and customer friendly.  I worked with a lot of great people and was able to train my assistant to successfully take over the store when I left.  Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting the wonderful people of the small community we were a part of.  The hardest part was having to terminate associates.  I seldom seen my market manager but when I did she was always friendly and informative.  I was able to learn how to better my communication skills and how to organize product in very small places."

good,"I loved this job for three years even though i wish the managers where a bit more comprehensive and nicer, i did cashier, deliver truck recovery and merchandise."

good,"Good atmosphere to work in, there were some issues with scheduling and available hours due to favoritism around the time I was working there. But new management is great I worked with her before she became permanent store manager."
good,"A lot of movement, a lot of in and out, a lot of rude customers, my life was in danger at 1 point working here, no security what so ever and bo insurance"
good,We only had to travel for a year.. Hurricane Harvey damaged the store & it took a year for them to reopen so in that year we travel to 10 different stores to work.
good,"very busy and loud. customers are rude and dont like to be patient.the hardest part is trying to wait on someone to come in , so that you can close up your register. the most enjoyable part is ringing up alot of people ."
good,I liked working st family dollar. It was close to where i lived so i was able to walk to work and walk back home. I worked different shifts and didn't mind working extra hours if they needed help

good,"I learned how to open and close the store. Check vendors in and out.  I learned to read sku #s & check out damaged items. I would advertise and promote sales.I learned tricks to operate a cash register to scan items faster. I also, learned how to manage someone who shoplifts and how to take care of the situation."
good,I was promoted from cashier to assistant manager in my third month working at Family Dollar. You’re able to build a relationship with your coworkers and customers. I enjoy being in customer service so this job is perfect for me. My voice as a manger is heard and 9/10 my manager allows me to manage my associates the way I feel is best.
good,I started off working as a Assistant Manager for family dollar in June of 2016 i got promoted to be a store manager in October of 2016 things switched up for me once i got my own store i had a lot of call offs and no call no shows they put me in a store that wasn't fully put together i spent for first 2 months getting the store together getting everything out the back room onto the shelf's for the customers to buy there was a lot of upset customers because of the store Condition after me and the team i hired got the store put together everything fell into place. after that my District manager came and told me that my store was outstanding and we did a Fantastic job of getting things done and organized so quickly Customers even said the same thing they was happy to be able to find everything and walk through the store without boxes and product all over the walk way.
good,"i loved thatr i got to work independently doing what i need to do, as well as what i think would need inprovement. i worked with great crew. we communicated all the time, sharing the work load often. there is lots of room to advance."
good,"Was a great place to work, we had a great team with the ecxeption of one.  Would definately go back to work for this company. Was unable to contact anyone in HR to check employment eligibilty, the prompt did not offer option to speak with a representative directly."
good,Love it! some times things could run a little bit smoother .and have a better atmosphere. But overall that just comes with your work of place . but we choose to what we make it . its been a great experience for me.and my boss has been amazing and so have my coworkers.

good,"I learnt alot when I become store manager it was fast pace, great work environment, I enjoyed the customers,  learned to make schedules, deposits. Hire and fire."
good,"Challenging working environment with company relocating home office as of late. Before news of relocation, office was very upbeat and innovative atmosphere.."
good,"Working for Family Dollar can be a fun exciting experience based on the fact that you have to know how to count money and be on a lookout for the bad matters. Whether it's making too little or too much money, if you get robbed you get the adrenaline and have to think fast on what to do, and at any time a top manager will walk in and check the appearance of the entire store and everything has to look perfect."

good,Love Working for this company everyone works together and management always there to help if they can the hardest thing trying to get a great team together
good,Working at family dollar is a very fast pace job. Customer service was number one to me. Family dollar taught me alot working there. How to manage the store and give the customers what the needed first. The hardest part working at family dollar was having a customer complain about not having items in stock or poor customer service. I tried my best to keep them happy.
good,enjoyed my work and coworkers but company sends mixed messages says can't give additional hours to work but we were always understaffed.  1 person doing the job of 2

I learned how to work well with other and to help those in need. It was a diverse work environment with few set backs because the team members always helped one another. I highly recommend this job to those seeking employment."
good,"my experience with family dollar was very challenging. I learned that being productive and showing a will to advance in a fast pace environment takes u a long way with family dollar. I started has a CSR then moved up to asst. manager. my duties was opening and closing the store, doing inventory on merchandise and unloading the freight to be place in assigned various locations around the store. Emails are to be sent to the GM everyday at closing. the store was recovered and cleaned every night before closing.The hardest part is some days u work alone and it can get busy. you are still required to do the daily duties before your shift ends. I enjoyed the customers and my fellow employees who became more life a family to me. during hurricane Harvey, we checked on each other and provided help to those we needed it. I'm thankful for the experience and the chance to work with such wonderful people."
good,"Being a forklift operator, the days were never the same. I worked with a fun and helpful crew.  We had different types of lifts and were trained on all 3. It was great job...could be hot in the summer and cold in the winter due to it being a warehouse."
good,It is an interesting and good pleasant place to work at. Nice team members and overall great management. It’s a great place to start out at. I have enjoyed working here.
good,"Great Opportunity to Advance, Fast paced environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing customers satisfied. I learned to really listen to the consumer to best suit their needs."
good,Family dollar has a great environment depending on the workers and teaches you communication skills and the manager and the workers had a great relationship and the only thing would make a bad day was if the day was going slow and not as many customers were coming in and everyday was a good day.
good,This was my favorite job. They treated me with respect and always looked out for me. My boss was also good to me always fed me and made sure she treated her workers like they should be treated.
good,"A great company, flexible hours, only left due to pregnancy. They do on the spot drug test, you have your set tasks for the day to have finished. Cashier, stock, or truck."
good,Overall I enjoyed working for family Dollar I started as an employee and got moved to assisted management in Two months . As long as u are a hard worker you will do great .

good,I really enjoyed here. The management was excellant and working with the coworkers were great too. Everybody got along and worked together and got things done.
good,"Was ok to work for, they just want you too work hard with little pay..I enjoyed this company only cause it was busy work and time went fast..it's not a long-term job though they don't keep you very long to rotation is a lot"
good,It was a great place to work and to be active in the communities.  I traveled a lot and succeeded very well with this company.  The company was taken over about 3 years ago and it was very hard to adjust to new rules and regulations.  There were no more advancements or incentives from Family Dollar.  The company before this happened was great!
good,The only job I have ever held where I felt challenged on a daily basis.  The area I worked for offered plenty of assistance from upper management. I often felt overwhelmed and always knew the reassurance and encouragement I needed was just a phone call away. My decision to seek other employment is strictly due to an injuring to my ankle that may make standing on my feet a solid 52-65 hours a week unrealistic.
good,Great company besides raises only come if you pass inventory which was difficult for my location. Never felt like safety of employees was a major concern
good,A typical day at work would have to start with walking in and clocking in. After you clock in you log into your info on the computer. Then you check to make sure your area around the cash register is clean. If not make sure you dust around it. You also have to make sure your area is clean and sweeped up. I really didn't learn to much. Poor management training. The hardest part is scanning the expired coupons that customer's bring in. The most enjoyable part is when it's time to clock out.
good,In this enviroment i learned alot of new things from dealing with all diferent types of people too putting my heart in sweat into having a succesfull functioning store. my hardest day would be the ones which i had to set up for a different things and i would try and finish it without stopping and get home exhausted because i had a one track mind and that was to be succesfull
good,"working in a retail environment can be fun but very challenging, always have to increase selling targets, maintain good customer service and continuous training is required."
good,"All employees, managers and district managers have been wonderful to work with. I am hoping to be able to transfer to a North Carolina store  as a part time sales/cashier associate. I have to relocate."
good,"The co-workers are Good people, depending on who the manager hires. And the work is simple, yet repetitive. However you may need patients, if someone chooses to work here."
good,There is no hard part working here the most enjoyable part is helping customers management are very nice and they will work will you. It is a clean place to work at
good,"extremely beautiful on the inside, neat and well colored coordinated, nice workers, great area, not a long wait, the workers are very helpful, respectful, love their work, will highly recommend others to go here"
good,"Easy going place to work"
good,Family dollar is a family oriented store that provide you with different needs at a great price. The stores are local and everything is easy to find when needed.
good,It  didn't take me long to Excel here. I started working to help put together a store that was opening. Then got hired on permanent in that store and got promoted in like 4 months to assistant manager.
good,It has benefits and offers job security like most jobs out there but they don't hire people who have a criminal record like felonies! It's hard to find a good job with security if a person has a felony.
good,Family dollars helped me learn how to understand the difference in human race. How to deal with different attitudes and stages as i often ran across some very crazy things being a cashier for family dollars
good,"very family orientated, great place to work at, everybody gets along with each other, the family dollar has an awesome management, gives everybody the hours needed"
good,I love working here at family dollar. It's a fun and fast pace job. I'm always moving and have multiple task to complete that make the time go by fast. Most of all I love the crew I work with friendly positive and hard working.
good,There is a lot of freedom working for this company and there was nothing very difficult about it.. It mainly consists of common sense. The hardest part was dealing with co-workers bringing outside business to the work place instead of keeping focus on what job needed to be done.
good,"The Family Dollar that I was working at had just built the store so myself and others was only hired as temp cashiers. A day for us would be putting stuff inside the store like: shelves, office materials, unloading trucks of inventory, etc."
good,"Was there for almost 10 years when job was eliminated and had no choice but to move on.  If that had not happened, I would still be there working and be happy with it."
good,The communication between management was ok. You never knew what to expect from them or what their next move was. It was a great place to work and meet new people but the employees did not have enough enthusiasm to want to work.
good,The overall store was great. It was the manager I had that the company could have made a better decision hiring. He was a bit racists. Overall the hours were great.
good,This job opportunity was a great learning and driven environment. During this job opportunity I have learned about service and service to others. I highly recommend this job.
good,"Great place to work. Management needs alittle work, but besides that its a great place to work. you get off at the time that you are suppose to get off and you have to options, if permitted, to work over time."
good,bi-weekly pay is the best crew is like family and somewhere I don't have to force myself to wanna get it up to go to. the job keeps you busy and you can interact and have fun while doing it
good,"great day. very productive. work the register ,  tag store items ,  work u boats.coworkers are friendly , most customers are nice , altercations are rare."
good,"I started out being a cashier, within 6 months I was promoted to Assistant Manager. A few months later I was promoted to Store Manager. I moved out of town to open a brand new store. I stayed there about 2 1/2 years then moved back to town and was at several stores helping get them in better shape. Then I took over a store back in town."
good,"I clock in right the moment I step into the store since work is always full. I deal with difficult customers, who are always on the verge of breaking out over financial difficulties. Management is superb at this place. I had a very good and knowledgeable manager. The culture is diverse/ The hardest part is cleaning trash since there is usually a lot. The most enjoyable part is to lean the skills of customer service."
good,It's a good company to work for just trying to get something closer to home.....I have really good employees and great customers...my district manager is willing to help however he can.....
good,"I started as a assist manager and trained for management. I would go in and prepare my deposit, and daily reposts and open the story. I done weekly displays and park downs."
good,"A typical day at Family Dollar would be interacting with customers scanning the items and placing them in the bag. I've learned that you have to make sure you don't spend to much time on one thing, The workplace culture was safe. The hardest part of the job was restocking and the most enjoyable part was interacting with others and conversing."
good,"I had a bond with all my regular customers.The only thing I could not get use to,was the random customers that would come in on a daily and steal merchandise. The high volume of theft did it for me.Overall , it was a great company to work for."
good,this is a good place to work very friendly and offer some good benefits. i enjoyed working there as i was learning a lot and helping customer with their coises
good,It was a good place at first to work at until they chance management. They everything went down hill from there. The co-workers was nice to work with. I learned how to work a business
good,"On any day we get real busy, and have to meet the customers needs quickly. We had long hours, but the interaction with the people coming in and out of the stores made it go by much faster. The hardest part of the job is maintaining the theft in the the target stores, and getting people to come to work."
good,It was okay  for the most part. Time went by fast and you get paid every week. There's no set schedule; you work when scheduled. The store is busy mostly.
good,I firmly believe in showing up to work on time always working your schedules I believe that my last job was a great company to work for I just didnt get enough hrs to survive
good,It was a different environment than I'm used to. Usually up constantly moving around. This job you are mostly sitting. Had to get used to that part. Not really into making sales to upgrade speeds On dsl .
good,I enjoyed working her by far the only job i had where the managers work just as hard if not harder as the employee's. I love being there and how connected the co-workers and managers are
good,A typical Day at work for me is clowning with the customers and also helping them at the same time making general conversation. also I'm doing returns giving change counting down draws setting the safe counting the safe reorganizing different areas of the store training new team members. that's the hard parts something I learned was that we had to drop a certain amount of money after so much has been entered into the draw. My co workers love me I'm the life of the store basically I get along with everyone and make myself known I'm here to help as much as possible not just here to manage but work as well. the hardest part of the job would be inventory time. the most enjoyable part of the job would be clowning with my co workers

good,"It was a very easy job, but not many hours, it's only a part-time job with very little benefits. Any job is better than no job, though. Management was very good, and professional."
good,I loved my job at Family Dollar there was always work to do but the atmosphere was always so relax it made the store comfortable for both the employees and customers. We usually had to work some holidays but we didn't mind cause the hours were never bad and shared. The opportunities to advance in the company were always available and with a little hard work it was never hard to move up. Only thing about the job that wasn't ideal was the pay was low but other than that I had no complaints would work there again.
good,"Every job is different and full of obstacles. Everything you learn in this job will come in handy in many ways. From customer service to unloading truck, I had a handful of skills that could be used in other businesses."
good,This job is a very fast pace job and detail oriented. I dealt with a lot of money and customers on a daily basis. Nice place to work.

good,"A typical day at work for me would be my usual daily activities plus every day would be different according to my work schedule.  I learned to be more confident in my work and provide the best customer service to everyone, no matter the different attitudes coming in to the store.  My co-workers learned to be great team players from working and training with me.  The hardest part of the job would be trying to work with minimal payroll since we were on a budget and would be short handed when the truck came in.  The most enjoyable part of the job was that I worked with customers, providing information to them to help them with purchasing products."

You can be having a bad day and they come along and change your entire prospective for that day!"
good,"helped customers find things in the store, customer service, stocked shelves, learned how to be the best cashier I could be, my manager and co workers were fun to work with, the hardest part of this job was the recovering of things that people took off the shelves but didn't put back.. the most enjoyable part was the interaction with the customers"
good,Willing to work with your schedule fun place to work learn everything in store great company to move up in management quickly fun environment its like the employees are your second family
good,"Its a great place to work at, like all jobs you have your rude and nice customers. overall it's a pretty fun and exciting place. A typical day at family dollar is coming in and not leaving with out getting at least one customer fussing at you about something."
good,"I enjoyed going to work their and meeting new people. I consider myself a easy going person, I am a hard worker as well. I learned that you have to treat every customers with respect as well as be kind and helpful with finding whatever they are looking for in the store. Working with the managers had its ups and downs. The ups was that they taught me how to be a leader in the business and the downs was on truck day everyone body was on edge because the head boss my have come in on that day but it was all good. I enjoyed all of my co-workers they made sure that I learned everything when I first started there. Their really was no hard part to working there. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping the elderly customers in the store fine what they was looking for it was the high light of my day."
good,"I always worked on the register, unloaded the trucks on Fridays, and was the 3rd keys man. I learned a lot there and how important working is. I learned how to multi-task better. Management was great and so were my co-workers. The hardest part of the days were probably unloading the truck and the best part of the days were slowing down and actually getting to breathe because we were so busy during the day."
good,A day at work usually goes quite well. I am usually stocking and/or cashiering at the same time.  I have learned to count down my own registers for openings and closings and change prices of inventory as well as add inventory count to store when certain products are delivered when requested by my manager for me to do the task. The management is not as strong as most managements I have seen in my store location. My assistance managers are not as responsible as I feel they should be or polite as they should be. There is not no real hard part about my job as much as there is responsibility to uphold. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing when I complete task in great time beating estimated times that are given.
good,"Very nice environment, n great people to work with. good atmosphere."
good,great work site. friendly and clean workplace. if you are looking to work in a fast pace sports bar you will love it.
good,"Overall, it was a good place to work.  The company had change upper management several time, and I felted it have lost it structure with the employees."
good,availiable upon request but i worked stock and cashier and cleaned the store 
good,you go to your  area  for  the  day  in  begin  to pull orders  you  learn  how  to   stay  on  task   my  manager  had  personal  agenda  with  some  employess  my  co workers  were  cool   the  hard  part  was   there was no production pay  best part was it was easy
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people everyday.
good,I liked working for them. the management morals sucked but overall great placed to work.
good,running the cash register and seeing the people in the community on an everyday basis was great!
good,i had fun at times working in family dollar they give you hours if you need it or they lower your hours if you need it they work with you that i liked very much
good,All the employees were very nice and they worked fast and never had a problem with nobody.We always worked as a team.
good,"As I was working for an year sometime I didn't feel like I was appreciate. I have notice that management only had two people during the day and night. I run the register all-day and had 1/2 hour lunch break. I believe if I was a manager I would make sure my employee to switch position, like run register for few hours and other stock up shelves for few hours, after few hours have the person from the stocking shelves to run register few hows and the person that run the register to do the stocking shelves for few hours. I get along with co-worker okay but I dont think the young person age of 19 should not be assitant manager. and I believe that at the end of the shift the cash out draw should be counted double to make sure it is right. I had no choice but I got the job so I can get myself thru the door and take care of my daughter."
good,"Flexable schedule, management advancements. Co-workers were like a big family. Overall the job is pretty simple. It's what you make it though. You have to keep yourself busy but can also work at your own pace."
good,"Enjoyable, interesting job. To my liking in a job. I enjoy working with money, meaning math, I wasn't much for stocking but was nice at times."
good,"We all participated in customer service and I was titled a Sales Associate. Most of the day was running the cash register but also clean up, inventory, stocking, etc. I got along really well with my co-workers and store Manager who was very friendly, fair, and no-nonsense which I appreciated. The hardest part was unloading delivery trucks but the best part was working with people"
good,"A day at work for me was constantly moving and helping others. At this job, I learned how the inventory store items, close the store, load and unload the supply truck, and manage the store with great leadership."
good,"Management team was great and understanding the whole team help me out alot first year in retail was the hardest for me but I learned Inventory and pricing controls,learn concepts quickly while working well under pressure. Excellent with customer support services.Ability to prioritize and remain focused on the essence of an issue"
good,Working for family dollar was a good experience I learned that it really isn't a easy as it looks. The hardest part of my job was working on truck day due to having to unload it and put it away. I also learned being a manager can get tuff because your pushed for time but I love a challenge and I got it done. My co- workers were great to work with didn't really have to constantly stay on them about their job
good,Enjoyable work experience
good,"A typical day at work for me is interacting with the public. I enjoy working with the public and having a great business relationship with them. I have been working at this location for two years and has got a chance to get to know what my customers like and do not like. Within the two years I have been here we have had at least 2-3 store managers, but I have had an excellent relationship with all of them. I have alos had good relationships with the other co-workers. We are like a family. To me the hardest part of the job is trying to prevent people from stealing and knowing what to do in case of a robbery. I enjoy everthing about this job. Im just saddened that this store is suppose to be closing at the end of June. So now I thinkl I have a chance to find me a better career."
good,If you can take heat and cold? It's the place for you. Good place to work.
good,Good people showing genuine interest in each employee. Very little pressure.
good,"Well i really enjoyed Family Dollar, the work enviroment was good I had the chance to work with different type of people. I had to handle the pressure in customer service and the number one rule the customer is always right."
good,"Great job when they’re not cutting hours! Great location, great management and flexible schedule is provided! I would recommend this job to everyone!!!"
good,If u have kids they work around your scedule. You are non stop busy so be prepared to actually work. People can be crabby. But you work with great people.
good,"They are willing to work with you as long as it isn't a habit of changing schedule..Good Place to work. Job wasn't too complicated, People I work with were Great. customers were friendly"
good,The days are usually normal you would greet customers walk around and restock and check expiration dates on item's. The management was great and respectful people.
good,"Its a nice place work. The management is very friendly. You can have a very flexible schedule. You can work mornings, nights, day shifts and weeekends"
good,The other employees were very nice and easy to get along with.The boss was great too.The were very helpful when I was training and I miss my old job! Hopefully another Family Dollar store will hire me.
good,"I enjoyed working at family dollar because my fellow employees were always nice to me. I met new customers and talked to returning customers every day, making new friends."

good,I honestly recommend working for Family Dollar. I have never enjoyed a job as much as I did there. I always wanted to go to work. I loved my boss and my coworkers.
good,"Good place to work. Decent pay. Management was helpful, friendly and easy to talk to if you had a problem. Friendly atmosphere. Team members were friendly and helpful also."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was when a customer would come in upset and then check out their items and i can cheer them up. I learned that even if you're upset yourself you can't bring that into the workplace or it upsets the customers.
good,"A typical day at work in Family Dollar all depends on the day of the week it falls on. But every day, I either come in before the store opens (generally an hour before) and get the store set up for the day's business, or come in to relieve a manager and close the store at the time of closing (generally 30 minutes after closing). If it's truck day, I would stage my receiving room to receive the truck and work the truck as it's coming in and continue to work it until the end of my shift. I would set my team members up with drawers to take care of customers' purchases and relieve them if we get busy. I would handle disgruntled customers along with employees as well. I would make a schedule once a week and have 3 weeks of schedule up so my team would be able to create a good home life balance. A happy team, makes a happy me. Teamwork is a strong stand point for me, and I feel if you have the right team in place, it's hard for you to fail at anything. I would straighten up shelves as I walk through the store and ensure there are enough product on the shelves from our receiving room and from our vendors. I would partner with vendors to create a strong relationship with them to ensure my store was in good standings from a vendors point of view. There is a system depending g on the day, whether that be work on certain departments ts on certain days, and it's a cycle. As long as you maintain that cycle , it can be the easiest job you can have."
good,"Great company, the people are all work orientated and not much talking. They have incentives every week( for those who meet the requirements and /or goes above and beyond), and making more money towards your hourly rate."

good,I have enjoyed working for Family Dollar very much! I will miss my whole team. I planned on staying with Family Dollar for the rest of my career but I need to do what is best for my family and that is why I am hoping to relocate and find a new adventure.
good,It was a fun place to work at. It was an easy job. Management is good. People feel safe working at family dollar.  Also there's no drama. Pay rate is ok.
good,It was a great job i think i left only because the manager at time i was employed wasnt really ready to be in a role that requires alot so i felt best to part ways .
good,I enjoyed working for family dollar. I had some problems keeping up with my being head cashier and having to do other chores that took me to the other end of store and having to rush back to the front to tend to cash register when called to ring up a sale. I felt like family. The customers were mostly very friendly and appreciated what I did for them daily.
good,It was perfect but i had to peave due rp a dispite unrelated to tje job 9.00 wasnt enough for the cpst of living and plus no insurance for partime employee's

good,"A typical day at work consist of stocking the merchandise, cleaning up and doing recovery. From working at family dollar I've learned about time management and different needs of the customers. The workplace culture is very fun and energetic. I enjoyed it a lot.

The most enjoyable part of the job is putting a smile on the customers face."

good,"My manager is willing to work with my schedule needs, she might not get to work on time every day but she gets the job done when she does come. As a cashier I never get off on time due to second shift coming in a little late. The rest of the team get off on time but if your a cashier your pretty much stuck until you are relieved."
good,Great opportunity to learn different techniques to apply in the future with other companies if necessary they have good flexible schedules overall for me the company was a really great experience
good,This was a great company to gain managerial experience. This was one of my first retail jobs and aided me in understanding how to manage a group of employees

good,"What do you expect me to write,"
good,A typical day at work is making sure your store run smoothly.Cashiers are perpared for their shift. Family Dollar is a good company to work for if you are looking for a job of longevity.
good,"This is a great company to work for but make sure you don’t have any intention of going to work thinking you will have an easy position. No matter what position you consider you are required to work freight, register, recovery and customer service and it can be easy if you have the right team and management all the way around."
good,Every day is a new day with different challenges . The job itself can be overwelming for the pay. I would recommend this job to young people who need a job but its not a career...
good,Upper management is poor they tend to leave all the work to the store manager until higher management apperars then you will see your dm in your store

All the General store Managers were Great. Especially. Two of them. My Training Manager out of Shelly ID. And My store Manager out of St. Anthony. I'll miss them Both. Keep It Up! Wonderful Company..."
good,"It was a very productive and fast-paced working which is more of my style that I like. The managers and the other employees were all very friendly. I was able to work and continue my school at the same time. No lunch is offered because as a cashier , you do all the cashiering and sometimes there is not enough time to finish your duties. Good for a temporary job."
good,"I had a great manager and good team members I work with. Pay was okay, and the work was very steady. Company made sure they kept you on your toes which was a very good thing. Good place to work overall."
good,"It was a fun, relaxed, but strenuous position at times.  The compensation was fine, the hours were fine, but the store I worked in had some issues with upper management"
good,"fast and slow past"
good,"This company was the first ever company to acknowledge skills I did not know I had. The advancement from within is amazing. This company teaches many things including customer service. I was promoted from cashier to assistant manager, and from that I agained confidence along with amazing leadership skills."
good,"My time working at Family Dollar was enjoyable and I must say I had one of the best management teams over me. From my coworkers to supervisors, everyone was a great help to one another. We made sure the workplace was very comfortable for one another along with any customers coming in and out of the store. There isn't one part about the job that I can say was difficult. Every job duty asked to be performed of you is reasonable and the hours scheduled for work was great being that I was enrolled in school also."
good,"A normal day was very routine based. i didn't learn anything. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with rude customers and having to be nice since the customer is ""always right""."

good,Nice co workers very helpful only thing is hours wasnt enough very rude customers stores always so messy need better associates my manager was the best manager i ever had at any job.
good,"I was in charge of unloading 1200 piece truck once a week,sometimes twice.After i would stock all merchandise on shelves.Management trained me very well in one week i was ready to work on my own.I also would work at front cashier station when i needed overtime or when it would get busy."
good,"I think if you work hard always you will enjoy it, just be careful and don't trust anyone. There are lot of good employees but I think its extremely hard to manage truck and cashiering at same time. Its lot of work but I enjoyed it. I needed money and they always played me."
good,"I learned alot about the types of stuff we sold, the most enjoyable part of the job was talking to people and making sure they ad everything they needed."

good,As an employee at family dollars. The company cares about their employees. And will do what they can to meet your needs. And make sure your taken care of
good,I never had a problem with the company until I got my own stores. The stores were in horrible condition.  I feel like I needed extra training to deal with that because the store that I was assistant manager at was almost perfect.  Never expected to get robbed.
good,"Good place to work."
good,"Managed day to day operations. Learned how to delegate, organize and mrket items to sell. I had a family environment for employees. Was always there for team and customers. The hardest part was unload piece trucks. The most enjoyable part was satisfying customers, seeing everything done and up-to-date, a clean store and hearing compliments from everyone."
good,Great retail company to start with and build customer service skills in a fast paced environment. Challenging at times but well worth learning the skills to advance. Career opportunities available . I've worked for Family Dollar for 6 years. I'm very satisfied with the company. Even though at times I feel that at store level we are forgotten about periodically. We work hard for corporate office in order to build a better company for us all but again I'm not complaining I love my job 😀
good,"I enjoyed working here because I had great coworkers, learned new skills daily and loved coming back to my job every day. I also loved my supervisor because she was nice and very helpful when I did not understand."

good,"With me, my typical day at work was just another hard day of work what I learned was how to stock shelves by SKU numbers it was a great experience for me. Management was okay, but also stressful, then there were fun days, but sometimes work got hard when the truck came the most enjoyable part of the day when we laugh about each other jokes at the end of the day about the mangers."

good,"This company is not a bad place to work for, The employees, and Manger's are super friendly, and very nice. The Company that i work for in Tulsa Ok, has very poor security, and I never been in a weird situations before. when I started this job, this company was getting robbed every two weekends, and if we wasnt being robbed, we would find a homeless person deceased around the build or by the trash can areas."
good,"morning paperwork , open reg. work on orders,stock, management was okay, the hardest part of the job was finding the right people for the job, the most enjoyable part was having supervisors taking pictures of my store to show others how it should look"

good,"A regular day at Family Dollar would be dealing with a load of angry yet satisfied customers in the beginning and ending of your day. They would come in collectively with family members, friends, and/or etc to get whatever it is that we were selling. Our clearance isle would sell the most due to the collaboration of the $1 and above dollar sales."

I am currently a student at South Texas College to get a better degree in Organizational Leadership to get a better knowledge of the job requirements that are needed to become a district manager.

When working at Family Dollar you have to work at a fast pace. It's all about multitasking. You would have to stop what your doing when a customer is ready to check out and proceed to check the customer out. When the day winds down and it's closing time, you'd lock the front doors, count your draw and clean the work area. You would clean behind the counter, make sure all the items are stacked neat and pulled towards the front if there's a space that's empty, sweep the floors, and mop.

good,"The reviews that I see on here are really unfair and disappointing. I have worked for the company for 4 years and with all due respect it is not for everyone. However, its what you make it. If you control your profit, hire the right people it makes life easier, if you don't then your life will be difficult. The people on here that for one, down a company that gave them a job FAILED because they did not do there job correctly day to day. Learn how to manage if you cant then speak up and there are training managers that run there store successfully everyday that would help you if needed. So before you write a bad review think about when you were looking for a job and who gave you a job."

good,"open get stored ready to receive guest for the day. count my bank, do my paper work for the previous day, do a walk through of my store mentally make list of things that need to be done for that day and who I have coming in that can do them. open the doors at 8. when my cashier comes in at 9 get him/her prepared for their shifts and work on my tasks for that day until someone comes to relieve me. I've learned to negotiate, with my staff how to balance different attitudes work at a rapid pace and to teach my employees to work smart. I think the hardest part of my job is sometimes working 12 to 15hr shifts without a break if you are the only manager there, there is no one to relieve you. What I find most enjoyable are the smiles. If i can say or do something to brighten an employee or guest day then it's all worth while. your employees want to work hard and do a good job and the guest keep coming back, not because you got better product, but because you know who they are you made them smile or went out of your way to see that they were taken care of."
good,Like working at Family Dollar but im moving away. The management is very understanding.

good,lots of work to do good people to work with co workers are easy to get along with hardest part unloading the trucks.
good,Every morning I would go in and perform my drawer count to ensure there was the correct amount of money before opening. After I would make sure all the displays were neat and in place for the customers viewing. All day I met and interacted with different types of customers.
good,"Responsible for providing exceptional customer service while assisting unloading all merchandise from delivery truck, organizing merchandise, and transferring merchandise from stockroom to store. Weekly ordering of merchandise using cycle counts to ensure the in stock representation also maintains inventories, store appearance, daily paperwork, and employee scheduling. Overall a great experience,"
good,"A typical day at work is making sure my cashiers' are staying busy and have plenty of work to last til the end of their shift. Then I make me a list of what is needing to get done. Whether it is after the truck has came and I make sure all the merchandise get up or if it is in the middle of the week making sure the over-stock gets worked and we have u-boats for the truck. Also if it is the end of the month, making sure the endcaps and cams get set by the end of the deadline or the first of the month to make sure the schematics get set. I know what to look for when I hire someone, know how to do the billing summary, set ads, run truck, run freight, set schematics. I am an assistant manager so I do anything I can do to help the store manager. My co-workers are fun to work with. They do their job and we all get a lone just fine. They know what to expect so they jump in and do it without complaint. We got a new store manager, so she is use to a low volume store. So, the hardest part of the job is picking up the slack and getting everything done that needs to be done so we wont be behind. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with my district manager so I can learn a lot of things I didn't know."
good,Work hard to put up with Customers stealing a lot and their complaints. Work right but it's never right good enough for the GM and district Managers. Sell this and Sell that for competitive and I get sick and tired of doing that. Keep hiring these young folks that don't like to work and some always call in when they though the job will be easy.
good,It's an okay place to work. Then only bad was the boss favorites was the other assit manager and his girlfriend that worked there. I learned there it's about who's butt you kiss will get you a long way.lol. but other then that I meet a lot of course great customers that I now are friends with.

Even though I could provide doctors information.

good,Fun place to work. Get to meet new people and get to know your community better. My first time working in retail and I really loved it! Would recommend anybody to shop at Family Dollar!
good,"I enjoyed my time there, great work environment, met a lot of great fellow employees. Store manager tried their best everyday. Store manager inspired me to do my best everyday."
good,Unload the truck on wednesday place them on pallets and carts stock the shelves off the carts for about 4 hours then run the cash register at the end of the day
good,"I enjoyed working at family dollar, the hours are lovely and they pay is good its a great work environment the employees are nice. its overall one of the best work experiences I have probably ever had."
good,i was training for manager assistant everything was good and easy i dont have no complain just not getting pay enough i need a full time job not part time thats all.
good,"Working at family dollar will test your costumer services skills especially if you never worked at a family dollar or dollar general , it keeps you moving and you meet a lot of nice people"
good,I miss this job and the people I worked with a lot the job was hard and fast paced but it kept everyone busy and we all enjoyed it  advancement came quick for me 2 months as Cashier to assisant manager and a great raise
good,Family Dollar is great but the pay rate is very poor. The hours are there and just need to hired fast-paced people. Customer shouldn't wait at all. Customer service need to be trained more by someone who been there longer enough that knows about the company.
good,They work you kinda long hours a lot of the time. If you work over ur salary pay that time is on you because your salary but your only based on 52 hours. It hard to work that much WTH no family time and always the same pay
good,Great workplace . Works with people. Fun environment. Keeps you motivated. Great hours. Never a down moment!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I’d love to go back in the future.
good,Would check people out at register and would off load trucks which i loved then would help people find what they needed or would stock the selves. loved working with the people I had with me at that time.
good,"I started here as a cashier and was able to meet new people. This job was when I first stated to test how well I can sell things that's typically just sitting on the self to give it attention. I have tons of memory from this job as it's was my very first and gave me my biggest of confidence to look forward to. The hardest part of this job was not being able to fully do everything like unload trucks alone, because I was new."
good,plenty of times to pick up over time. I disliked working certain holiday. I like the fast and slowed pace environment. I live d the customer and the  employees
good,A typical day at work is normally slow in the morning and by the afternoon it gets pretty busy and before you know it your shift ends. i've learned that you never know what somebody is going through until you take the time to talk to them . Some can say that  they are having a good day or some just want somebody  to talk to because they might not be having a good day you just have to take the time to talk to people let them know that you too care . Being a manager was like home really. The customers that have watch me since i was a cashier were very proud of me when i got promoted but were very sad to see me leave when i did  go to another  store . No that job wasn't easy but it made me feel even more responsible and made me feel like people were now depending on me and that i couldn't let them down at all. The hardest thing about my job would have to be the safe . running low on cash for my cashiers was very hard because there wasn't nothing that i could do because my manager wouldn't be in the store to help me so i had to make sacrifices. The most enjoyable thing about my job is the staff . Being around enjoyable amazing staff makes your job soo much easier and your day very great even the customers can see and that is whats most important .

good,Team members cooperate with one another to achieve the tasks asked of them whether individually or with assistance from a fellow team member. Store is kept organized and tidy.
good,"I was able to jump right in along with learning and taking on different challenges,  wasn't scheduled enough hours, seemed a better job opportunity co-workers wasn't a great team player"
good,Nice place to work for. Enjoyable people to work with. Until management came in and if store wasn't perfect they let you know even if it was clean. Awful bonuses.

Staying on my feet is one of my strengths. I'm glad to say i'm a team member of Family Dollars. The only reason i would consider leaving is for more money"
good,I will start off by saying Family Dollar pays more than minimum wage even for entry level employees... I loved the store I was at it was extremely neat clean and a very relaxed working environment. The only reason I left is lack of promotion...
good,I had to leave because I took a better opportunity. But it was a friendly atmosphere and the workers were extremely nice. I liked working in customer service.
good,The work environment at family dollar was friendly. It was a great team environment. The workload was pretty easy but it was a lot to do to keep you busy and help your day go by fast.
good,I enjoyed working with the other employees. We worked together as a team. Truck day was the hardest part of the job depending on how big the shipment was.
good,i loved family dollar. we were truly like a family. it was one of the best work experiences ive ever had. i would highly recommend it .theyre the nicest people ive met
good,I liked the job but I never knew when I worked till a few hours when the manager called or texted......................................................
good,This job has the best environment I have yet to know. I love working for Family Dollar but I’m currently relocating and I know that I’m not going to find another job for Family with the same amount of hours where I’m moving.
good,Hours were very flexible. Fun environment. Manager was very accommodating with anything going on in your life. Pay was decent. I enjoyed the atmosphere and type of work.

good,Working for Family Dollar taught me hard work pays off. The hours were long sometimes but the upper management made it bearable. I love working with people and solving problems.
good,"I enjoy working for the company, but the manager I work for is to soft, he allow certain employee's to tell him what they will and will not do. The overall company is a great place to work."
good,Great job great customer just bad attitude store manager my customers love me and my csr workers as well but overall it was a great experience and I appreciate the opportunity
good,"This is a relaxed work place. The organization is good as well as the management. However I wouldn't consider this as a full time job, definitely part time."
good,Family Dollar was a fun and exciting place to work you adapt to your customers and coworkers I would have loved to continue to work there but I had issues with family outside
good,"Working at Family Dollar has showed me how to be better at multi-tasking. Having great service towards the customers, as well. I learned how to work at a fast pace. Stocked daily and made sure to greet every customer with a friendly face. The hardest part of my job was nothing because I enjoyed my job, and meeting new people everyday."
good,Long as there is a good crew of worker's and management everything will go accordingly. Most of the time the store is nice and clean with friendly worker's.
good,"Basically, you will not receive training all at once on the job. Every day you learn something different.If you are new, expect to ring the bell for the manager the first week or two until you get comfortable. You may have to put tags on clothes and stock store products while looking out for customers so that you can ring them up. I wouldn't consider it stressful because you usually have somewhere there to help you unless you are working the morning shift.Then you have to wait for someone to get there to balance the workload. Most of the customers are friendly, but you may have 1 or 2 negative experiences every week or two. It mostly depends on the circumstances. It is fast-paced because I work in a high volume store. We are just like a family. The manager is very reasonable and understanding of things such as: children, illness, other jobs, and religious services and makes allowances for tardiness if it's important."
good,"Although Family Dollar was the first store in which I obtained retail experienced, I caught on extremely quickly and my team members were a big help. I enjoyed the monthly competitions and forming relationships with my customers."
good,Family Dollar was a great company to work at! Family Dollar has a great atmosphere and is very inviting and the staff treated each other like family .
good,They are compact stores so it doesn't take to long to learn where everything is. the work environment is very laid back and everyone in our store got along great so it was always fun.
good,A typical day at work was adaptable after you get a schedule down on how I would do things. The hardest part of my job was when my employee would not show up because it would put me behind on my duties and theirs.
good,It is a great job to work for. The coworkers are excellent. You'll might have some ups and downs but all is well. Very good place to get promoted. And never discriminate anyone.
good,"Stocking was trouble . easy money , Fast paced , competitive work , nice customers , Nice managers , they gave me extra hours when I needed them . long hours are so pros"
good,"The staff that is there makes the days go by. There are some amazing customers that will have my day pleasant. the location is very convenient for me, but its time I step out my comfort zone and get into something else."
good,This was my first place of employment upon completion of high school and entering adulthood​. It taught me what real life responsibility was all about.

good,a day here was ok the only thing was the neighborhood people would come and steal but other than that it was fine I learned how to handle big amount of money
good,Was a fun and relaxed environment to work in. Used a lot of customer service skills and help stock the store on truck days. Best part about this job was getting to know the customers
good,"Great company to Work for, not too good hours being a store manager, less hours in other positions but overall great to work for , employees and customers becomes a family they have each other back as long you take care of each other, I loved the company I'd go back and work for them but I can't not with the schedule they got"
good,Always work to be done. Schedules worked with emplyees lives well.needed to have more staff if it would be allowed. So many tasks to be done with low staff makes completeing all assigments not posdible. Customers make the job their friendly faces make the day so enjoyable.
good,Family Dollar is a great place to work at. They work around your schedule and gives you opportunities to grow and advance within the company. The pay and benefits are great as well.
good,"as for me I love to meet new people and laugh and talking with the people I came in contact with , enjoy walking around fixing thing and the make thing look good in my store.

good,"The Family dollar location in Welcome, North Carolina was a very enjoyable, hard working store. Everybody pulled there weight and we got the job done."
good,I enjoy working there. Nice management great customers and nice pace. On a typical work day you should be able to get all duties done before or right on time.
good,"Working for Family Dollar was a great experience for me. "
good,"Very busy not enough staff to keep store running where it should be, ,fast on moving up ..learn new thing everyday . It is a great opportunity in learning how to manage your team"
good,This was a job i could see myself continuing to do until I was robbed at gun point. I no longer felt safe in the store or with the company. Thanks to my incident they are now working on ways to fix what has been broken.
good,a typical day at work would consist off working the register but mainly i was a pack out guy when the truck came in. working for family dollar i have learned how to  pack out very well learn to read SKU numbers work the PDT gun and run the register kind of all at the the same time. the work place environment can go from not busy to busy very fast in a heart beat when you least expect it you half to stay on top off things at all times and listen carefully to the manager. the hardest part off the job is first learning how to adjust to the store running the register is the most hardest-part because you half to learn how to read the screen make sure the customer is getting back the exact change and the computer is running pretty fast and not slow. what i enjoyed most about family dollar you was the people my and the staff iv'e had great laughs with them and although everyday wasn't golden i was still grateful to come to work and see the laughs on everyone's faces and a very good work environment.
good,Everything about Family Dollar is all good except Job Security. The benefits are Great My Manager really knows her stuff. I Like working with my co-workers they are the best. I learned a lot about the set up of the store and how the store is to ran still have a lot more to learn but its been worth it. the hardest part of the job  i can not keep everyone from stealing but i try.
good,This job is really like having a second family. Everybody is very friendly and very encouraging. Family dollar is a very secure place and it has a good environment to work in.
good,Very product and clean enviroment along with friendly and helpful staff. It made the job go alot easier. I learned alot about customer service and how to handle aggressive and rude customers.
good,"hours varied a mostly closed at nights with the manager but some days i open early at 8am get the store ready before we open at 9am then to recaps,and and stock endcaps, unload the trucks when they come and clean the bathrooms after my we close before my shift is over.."
good,"I loved everything about Family Dollar. My manager was a great friend and boss. Good money, Good hours, great customers and clean store. I would go back in a heartbeat!!!!!!!"
good,"Working at family follar was a grest experience, the work place was fun, and safe. The pay rate wasnt sufficient for me. Im at a point in my life where im looking for stability and working at family dollar does not allow me to live a stable lifestyle."
good,"I came in, was givin my job duties and i worked. everyone pulled together as a team! the management was wonderful, and the pay wasnt so bad. Unfortunetly it was only seasonal tearing down one store and building another. i would have stayed if i could have!"

good,"Never worked at a more disciplined but yet friendly environment. The staff worked as a cohesive unit, but maintaining an enjoyable environment for customers and employees."
good,I enjoy my job overall working with Family Dollar. My customers make it all worthwhile. Seeing or hearing someone complement me on the job I have done and continue to do as the Store Manager makes me overall happy!!
good,"A typical work day entailed operating the cash registers, answering the telephones, counting the tills before and after my shifts, greeting and assisting the customers, keeping the register areas neat and providing a positive shopping experience for the customers."
good,"I started out as a cashier, and I pretty much ran the register and restocked shelves. I worked both shifts at one point in time then I gravitated toward night shifts. The night shift consisted of straightening the front of the store, and running the register. I did night count with the manger. A few months later, I was moved up to Assistant Manager, honestly it was a lot work to handle. But, I manage I did not stay long due to personal reasons, but I enjoyed working there."
good,"Opening store, taking deposit, managing work flow for the day, working stock, unloading truck, training co-workers, schematics, setting store to the monthly planner."
good,"Family dollar was my very first job straight  out of high school. I was very nervous when I began my training but, with in a weeks time I was doing just about everything on my own. I ran the register greeting every customer that walked in the door. Something that was different from Family dollar then the rest of my jobs is that I was taught how to count down my own drawer. I thought that being able to do that was very interesting. Along with running the register and greeting customers I learned what Family dollar calls fronting and facing. This is when you walk up and down every isle turning all cans to the front, making sure that there were no misplaced items laying anywhere and if there were putting them back. My manager was the coolest manager I had ever had. He wasn't afraid to run a register and help the rest of us when needed. As far as my co-workers we all got along great, we always helped each other with the different jobs that we did around the store. The hardest part of the job was unloading the truck every week because the truck would be packed almost the ceiling. I believe the most enjoyable part for me was talking to all the small town customers that I grew up with and helping them find the things that they needed."
good,I loved working at family dollar there was also something different everyday. I loved meeting and helping new customers and also seeing the same customers everyday
good,It's the best place you can work at if it's your very first job. Management and co-workers are extremely nice and respectful. Hours are great if it's a busy store and if you have an open availability.

good,"Greeted and assisted customer to find products in store"
good,"At this job, I work as a cashier, greeter, stock shelves and provide general security. This is a part-time job that has great workers and customers."
good,This was one of the great experiences I have had with a temp agency. This job pays excellent and has great security as well!
good,"A typical day included cleaning, facing and helping customers. I loved both my managers and co workers, because it was such a small store everyone worked together and knew everything so they ended up being like a second family. The hardest part of working that job in that location was not knowing spanish to be able to understand or communicate with all my customers. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people and building relationships with regular customers."
good,Working at family dollar was a fun place to work but everyone still worked hard while maintaining that environment. I started there as a cashier and was promoted quickly so there is plenty of job growth with this company. Most of the managers I had were good but a few of them didn't do there job or were not skilled enough to run the store.
good,Family Dollar is a wonderful place to work. The enviroment is customer based. Managment is loyal and motivational. Policies are inforced as they should be.
good,"The job keeps you busy, little down time, except your thirty minute break. Great boss to work for. Get every other weekend off."
good,It was generally a good place t work. I enjoyed the employee's I worked with. Especially the store manager. Who I found to very pleasant to work for.

good,The management was nice and respectful to me and I could balance my work and personal life. the only reason I left is because I needed a full time job and Family dollar was a part time position
good,Ringing up customers and always greeting them upon entering and leaving. stock merchandise from the truck and always out newest dates in the back. clean the store upon opening and closing. Always make a customer happy. Remember a customer is always right.
good,"I enjoyed working for family dollar because there was great advancement, the employees were wonderful to work with. The hardest part was having to get to work really early in the morning the day after the truck arrived to stock merchandise."
good,"all my working days was also fun and put in alot of hard work"
good,"Each store is unique in its own way, what you pout into it is what you will get out of it"
good,Worked good hours made sure that the store was ran smoothly and kept down customer complaints
good,"I worked on a small team of only four people including the store manager, one supervisor, one co-manager and myself. I felt very at home and relaxed working there. We unloaded the 'stock truck' every week while simultaneously keeping up with cashiering and register duties! It was hard work but paid off when I was given my first raise after six months. We always have regular customers coming in as well as tourists or people just stopping by for a drink."
good,"It is a fun place to work. Every job as it's ups and downs, but this one is a little different."
good,This was a ok job but the manager act like she didnt know what to do.

good,"I learned alot from family dolloar, it being one of my first jobs, I was taught how to do cashier as well as management training. I recieved good hours and benifits."
good,"A standard day at work for me is running the cash register, and putting up stock.  Putting up stock is also the hardest part about the job.  On of the greatest things about this job is that I am learning everyday from the store manager.  My co workers are very easy to get along with, and they are also the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,I greeted customers when they entered the store and made sure they got help at all time when needed it
good,the managers and staff all work co-dependent of each other. no two days are ever the same
good,Family Dollar was a very nice place to work. I learned a lot from there. it helped my to see how it is with a real business.
good,Working for this company was good. Hard work and dedication to the job goes a long way. I was promoted before I thought I was ready but the store manager thought otherwise.  The employees were very hard workers and knew what had to be done on a daily basis. I enjoyed working with the people I did because I knew I could count on them to get the task done.
good,I enjoyed my time at Family Dollar and if I could I would still be there but it was time to depart from the company.
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with and the customers. The hardest part of the job was processing freight and running a cash register.
good,"Enjoyed everything I did, cashing out customers, cleaning the store, organizing the shelves."
good,"The job was fun and productive when interacting with customers and employee's. Always stayed busy, but also learned how to make the job fun and enjoyable for everyone. I loved almost everything about this job, but the hardest part of the job was working 60-70 hours a week."

I have learned to be able to multi- task, and being patient when it comes to customers. A typical day at work is noramlly good and everyone leaves with smiling faces. We work together as a team to eliminate all of the stress and frustrations"
good,"Working hard pays off. They take care of each and every employee and celebrate accomplishments with compensation and fun in-office activities. Hardest part about the job would be the amount of work vs. the amount of hours in a day to do it in. Sometimes there are too many meetings instead of decisions, but overall everyone's voice is heard."
good,"I enjoyed working for family dollar, co workers was very friendly and helpful as well an the managers."
good,"a typical work day was easy going and productive"
good,I really enjoyed my job there. I enjoy helping people and meeting new people everyday. All of the employees were very nice and always eager to lend a helping hand. I learned how people wanted to be treated and did my best to make sure that they had a good shopping experience. There was not anything hard about this job. I sometimes wanted to get more hours then I did.
good,"A typical day would be me counting the registars, cleaning up areas and restocking.I learned how to deal with many types of people. Management was great everyone always knew what their job was and how to do it. co workers i was the youngest there so at times it was a little weird. the hardest part of the job was making sure the customers had what they needed. I enjoyed just about everything that had to do with the job."

good,"The customers were friendly.I enjoyed coming to work. There was always something to do. There was never as dull moment.It was fun setting up shelving schematics from month to month,setting up end-caps for sales circular. It was very difficult to find hard workers that could keep up with the amount of work we were expected to do. When I was promoted to the store in New Hope the employees were very rude and they did not want to do any work that was expected. I was unable to find any one to hire that would pass the required test,so I could catch a break. Unfortunately they hired a new District Manager who made many demotions within the company. Therefore my career ended prematurely,and with little or no reason."
good,It is ok cause it helped pay for my schooling and things I need at the house.
good,good hard working people learned more how to become a manager

good,A typical day at work starts around 6 am i enjoy getting started as soon as i arrive i would get my responsibilitys and start working. I learn new things every day about all the different kind of trucks that arrive and the way the trucks need to be counted and unloaded. I always get along with my co-workers and they teach me new things and i teach them new things so we all help each other through out the day. I would have to say i enjoy every part of my job thats why i am trying so hard to get back into the warehouse work i find that i dont enjoy my day doing any other job i do them because i have to take care of my family. Then my day ends at around 5 pm ready to do again.

Working there was crazy fun, the employees were great and the customers were something else, but never had a dull day.

The things you do with managment are harder  but after time of learning it all it gets better."
good,"It was busy most of the time , especially before 6. I learned how to unload a truck , build a end-cap, stock shelf's correctly. the hardest part about the job was when its really busy and the truck has to be put away, you have to handle customers and put the products away all at once."

A typical day at work would involve unloading the truck (once a week), stocking and recovering shelves, assisting customers with whatever they need, balancing cash tills and safe daily, making bank deposits, providing optimal customer service to everyone I encounter whether clients or employees. The team that I hire/build is a great mix of races and genders, showing no favoritism and respecting all cultures and religions.

The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to bring tasks to completion and going home at the end of the day knowing that I made a difference!"

Numerous isle's and levels of isle's of stock were necessary in being accounted for in order to better progress in productivity. Which is exactly what I learned in my time there, how important the role of an Inventory Control Specialist is, and how that role plays out for the expectations of productivity in itself. I believe the hardest part of the job would have to have been loading and unloading a truck, once a week, by audit implementations within the process. Even though it was once a week, is was a vigorous and enduring task - but a task it was to ensure truck loads were accurate and precise."

At the time when I was working there wee some good co-workers working with me and great bosses. they always did their best to keep the place clean, theft free and comfortable for the customers to shop always good deals and good team work. in my opinion the hardest part of this job was to keep every single customer satisfied due to the fact that we cannot always meet their needs. other than that I loved the hours I was given and the fun things we did during the holidays."

good,"My work in one shift depends on what shift I take. If i work a morning shift, I reboot the cash registers, reopen certain product chambers (such as cigarette case, discount items shown outside of store, etc.). I then begin to either restock and reorganize products and their shelves, or perform recovery duties as needed to promote aesthetic qualities of the work environments. Whilst the customers seek out products for purchase, and proceed to the cash register so I may perform the proper transactions for the consumer, using suggestive selling and psychologically altering variables to persuade consumers to buy more product than they intended, and make them feel happy to come back and perform more transactions. Prior to 30 minutes of my shift ending, I close my register counter and begin declaring the amount of money I have in the register and compare to the sales i made that shift. I then reset the amount of money inside the register and store it in the proper place by manager assistance. Afterwards, I clock out of my shift."

I end the night with counting everyone's money and create a deposit. I learned a lot working here. I learned adult skills, and no matter how much someone gets under your skin never become bothered, always show respect. My manager is very understanding. The workplace is clean. My team members are respectful for the most part. The hardest part of the job is honestly the rude customers I have to handle. But I don't let that bring me down, I handle it the best way I can.

good,My typical procedure for opining the store consisted of putting the tills with appropriate change in he registers and get the change to be used throughout the day ready. I would then print the paperwork and run register while stocking until my back up arrived and i would then stock and handle any customer problems. I learned how to run small scale store and manage a small team while also keeping the customers coming back for great service. The hardest part was working an open to close shift only because it is half of the day was spent by yourself and it can be difficult to keep working when handling the register. Another difficult issue i came across several times was shoplifters unfortunately there isn't much we as staff can do about that.

Making sure money was documented correctly the previous night and dropping off money deposits, filing receipts afterwards. Assessing how much money we lacked and creating money orders.

I had to learn to adapt like multi-tasking between customers and working on schematics and running a register at the same time. Management was pretty fair if your willing to work with them they are willing to work with you. My coworkers were always pretty nice and upbeat, we all worked together to make our store look its best.

Co workers were not as easy to work with, I was mostly alone up front, and my co worker was usuallly hard to find through the store if I needed help. The hardest part of the job was communcation between co workers. If I had a problem with my register or a customer, I had to go search for my co worker which only made matters worse.

I learned when I first started that I really had to step up my game to be on the ball all of the time. I feel that I definitely accomplished a lot in the past year. My manager, and other assistant manager and I all were very close and goal oriented to make sure our store was in tip-top shape! When my manager would leave out to another store I was always idling to step up and take over for as long as I was needed. I really got a chance to get to know some of our regular customers as well as know myself as a worker. The hardest thing was wrapping my mind around the fact that I was helping run a store! I really loved my job and everything that came with it. It definitely shaped me into the best worker I can be, and I think I added a little ""uhmpf"" to the store as well!"

I also loved the fact we worked as a team we worked as hard and as long that we had to to make the store a great place to shop so they would come back and have that great visit everytime.
good,Working for this company is good because you don't have to much to do like if you work for a bigger company well since this is a small retail store the work is much easyer. If you are a cashier you would have to work the front counter and tag clothing and stock front area products. But overall you can grow and move up with the company.

good,I enjoy working at Family Dollar with great people. It is one of those jobs where I do not have to dread going to work. There are not many hours. I go in to unload the truck and proceed to put merchandise onto the shelves. That ends up to be about 2 or 3 days of work while working on average 6 hour shifts. The co-workers and management are excellent. I have learned discipline and how to complete assigned tasks by the timeline the manager appoints to me. The hardest part of the job is staying motivated after numerous hours of putting merchandise onto the shelves. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting a sense of accomplishment of completing goals assigned while working with friendly people.
