rating,review
bad,this company is a joke and so is the union . They’re new system does not work and you’re still reliable for your numbers . Management sucks . See 4 urself
bad,"Their priorities are money, incompetence, wasting your time, working you like a slave on a plantation, etc.  If you go to and read what they say on their website instead the internet you would never realize what you knowingly getting yourself into."
bad,They are a low-down slimy pile of dung company to pretend to bargain in good faith. Tell you they want you and then sell you down the road for slave labor
bad,I probably would’ve taken a job here but who wants to work and not know what time you’re getting off every day if they had regular shifts there I probably wouldn’t be such a revolving door who wants to work at a job and you don’t know what time you’re getting off every day specially if you have a wife family kids I would only recommend this job if you’re really desperate down on your luck but I think I can speak for most people no one wants to work a job and not know what time you’re getting off being forced to work 15 hour days every day not knowing when you’re going home
bad,"This is a Very disorganized and very cheap company, they do not want to hire any experienced people. Trying to keep management salary at the lowest they can"
bad,"UNFI has many problems in leadership with communication, no supervisor seems to know what is going on at any given time. You are expected to hit production standards, but 90% of the warehouse is under production as it is, and there is no disciplinary action taken."
bad,This place is a joke don’t do it they don’t care about u I put in 22 hrs in one day and they fired me right before Christmas cold as balls plus the hr department low key racist 🤔
bad,The place sucks to work at. Hours are horrible and your just a number. Everyone is miserable and hates their job. Worst environment I’ve ever worked in
bad,The management at Unfi is so messed up if management was better Unfi would be an good company to work for an the point system is something out of this world Unfi needs to come together an fix there system an have more sympathy for its workers because it’s workers work 15-18 hours an day an have to come rite back to work with only couple hours of sleep
bad,"70+ hour work week, favoritism among workers and supervisors, unrealistic quotas, not enough equipment with half of the electric pallet jacks barely working and unprofessional management."
bad,"You're on your feet 12 hours or more every day, and you will be fired after 90 days if you don't meet the quota.  They talk about safety and workers, but all they care for is the bottom line"
bad,"All is horrible. The organization is void of leadership, and you step back into all the negatives of a 1980s high school drama. Don't speak up lest you be the next target. But you soon find out the grass actually is better on the other side... better pay, better benefits... the organizations doesn't care. You'll be replaced by someone who will work for less. Very thankless environment."
bad,"This a an unsafe company to work for. The cooperate level doesn’t care about the working people, they laid the whole warehouse off (1year-42 years) over a dispute with the union. Customers are leaving, due to loads falling over in the trailer. If they could pay below minimum wage they would. They value no employees"
bad,"This company sets you up to fail. Two of the three weeks I was supposed to get training, the person assigned to do so was working from home.  I got almost zero time with my supervisor during my training as well."
bad,Worse management ive ever worked for at unfi I wouldn't recommend anyone there in 8 months i reported to 3 supervisors and seen maybe a good 25 30 people quit terrible leadership HR and supervisors are not on the same pages just a horrible experience
bad,"Very bad company lack of management,  supervisors and managers they don't know what to do !! Zero management they dont give you your breaks or lunches on time they try to steal your breaks !! For example If you don't meet your coda the supervisor will tell you try not to take your break so you can meet your stupid picking numbers!!"
bad,"It does not matter how long you are there, the CIO does not care about people  He is  a bully and demeaning to bis staff  throws people away when they are no longer useful  you will never get training, it is the first thing he takes from the budget each year when he does not have enough for projects . No advancement, high stress, nothing is good enough, and no life balance.  If you want to avoid heart failure or prozac, stay away."
bad,"Manager and supervisors always leave early even when the work is not done. All the work must be completed in order for the CSR to leave and they are no help from management as they are long gone. "
bad,"The amount of work we do with the a month of time we have is very unacceptable. The work was very draining . We worked 14,15 hour shifts for 5 days a week the 2 days we had off all we would do is sleep we had no social life not time for our family . Working 60-75 hours a week and only getting 600,700 dollar checks is not good at all"
bad,"only career advancement or good work is if you have a friend or relative in management or that could give you, workplace culture is unstable and deceptive, threats of being fired or disciplined if you speak out. attendance points policy changes weekly. this is not an associate or family-oriented place. the associate turn over ratio is at least at 85%. also there is outside contract workers that are not trained properly in which makes this place un-safe to work in."
bad,They have no care for anyone or anything but money and how much profit they can get from you. Start you at     10-12 hour shifts 4 days a week and then make it mandatory 5 days 15 hour shifts. You’ll either kill your self from exhaustion or want to kill them for not caring even a little about how hard the job is
bad,No sleep no time for family and yourself. I wouldn't  recommend any one that raisin a family shouldn't work there the manager are childish only think so in mature
bad,"They treat people like disposable slaves. They trick you into"
bad,"This place is garbage. One, their motto is BLAME first, ask questions later, and apologize later if necessary and you only get an apology 10% of the time or even less. Two, per former VP of Technology Operations, word by word, ""This is NOT a place where people want to come to work at."" When the VP literally says that word by word, you know this place is garbage. Three, within the past 3 years, 13 people are gone and only two replacements have been filled. That shows how greedy this company is. Four, don't bother asking for a raise or compensation. Doing three jobs and taking on some of the tasks that belong to other teams for the price of one is not considered above and beyond. People equate this as enslavement. Five, management is garbage. Those that create a hostile work environment while sucking up to management don't get fired. Management has their favorites turns a blind eye on injustice. Justice delayed is justice DENIED. DON'T EVER WORK HERE. You will be treated poorly, disrespected, and management won't bother to take any action."
bad,"Worst place ive ever worked. No work life balance. Was dead tired daily. Expected to work at a hundred percent pick rate. Made for a very dangerous work environment. Every one is racing to make rate. Expect to work 12 or hrs a day. Pay should be at least 20 bucks an hr. Good thing was 3 days off, not necessarily  3 in a row. The unpredictability of the hrs on the other days made the three days off feel like 2 tops."
bad,"management socks ,, the general manager doesnt do his job right ,, they fire general managers more than anything,, union dont do anything for us ,, they have 4, 10s days buy looks like 5 , 15s , they said we have 3 days off but they mando come to work one of them for 13 hours, you can get fire in 3 days , supervisors dont know what they are doing DONT WORK HERE , there are many other options , heavy work , fast work , you get hurt they dont care"
bad,"Apart from having someone run the place that as a person is himself a terrible selector and lift, the place is a mess. "
bad,They will make you drive far away for a screening and physical test just to pass it all and ignore you. They have done it to myself and many others. Bad company.
bad,"For two weeks I witnessed your food being stepped on thrown around even urinated on ( yes one time employee didnt want to take time to stop to go to otherside of warehouse, no point in notifying management they dont care about the food nor the employees ,most of the management got there by doing the same its by far the worst place i ever worked at far as management goes too many chiefs not enough indians , i  was lied to let go then lied on"
bad,Management is awful and turnover is high.  Management talks down to everyone and they don’t properly train staff.  When you speak to Human Resources about it even they don’t care.
bad,"Everyone is pretty much on the way out not just new guys but I would see people who worked there over a year get fired or quit, to the end of my job there people were getting fired every other day almost for what seems like nothing. My trainer was horrible didn’t criticize me at all just kinda stood there also my manager didn’t even really talk to me until maybe my 2nd month there because he’s on a different schedule. Not much overtime maybe a hour or two but some weeks I got 32.If you don’t have prior selecting experience don’t bother because every week they push you harder and harder and act like you aren’t trying hard when some nights you could be lifting the same 70-90 pound meat boxes over and over again for hours but then lector you about being faster"
bad,"The company doesn't intend to keep anybody nor do they try. My biggest complaint is the lack of safety around the equipment. When i was operating the forklift, employees around me wouldn't give the proper space to operate safely while my forks where in the air. I complained time and time again about safety and would bring up osha. Nothing was done and so i wouldn't recommend anyone to go there."
bad,"worst job i ever had! they hire anyone! ridiculous amount of work! i feel bad for anyone who works there!supervisors hound you,the product is super heavy,waste of time, period!"
bad,"You need to arrive 45-60 mins before the start of your shift (unpaid) in order to obtain a pallet jack that is required to work (they have more staff than equipment) Otherwise you won't be able to work your role and will be told to clean the warehouse instead."
bad,Management sucks (nice to your face but will chew you up when they leave). Too much work and not enough pay. Always changing what we are doing. Doing everyone else job with not much time left to do your own. False hopes all the time.
bad,never go here never work here it may have changed since last employed but man when I was there it was nothing to clock in at noon clock out at six am and be back at noon or loose your job.
bad,at first when i start it was a nice place but it turns out that they overwork you if you are in the shipping deparment and think thats the only thing you are gonna do you are wrong they force you to do other jobs that you don't get pay enough to do it while other people just sit around doing nothing
bad,Very stressful and and they expect the selectors to work over 12-18 hours and a day and no life balance with family and very poor management. Supervisor and managers did not treat employees with respect and some employees did drugs in the parking lot smoking marijuana and they stank and the supervisors knew about it and they did nothing to prevent it and the supervisors still allowed them drive the forklift machines. Worse company I have worked for...
bad,"Poor place to work. No structure. Managers and HR were all cut throat. The demand to service the customer the correct way is hardly ever met. Managers don't have anyones best interest at heart, Extremely long hours."
bad,"Working long hours , employees taking longer breaks and lunches! Still hand picking orders off of paper labels, very behind on the technology. Grocery is always last to leave and working us 20hrs a day"
bad,"People were ""let go"" constantly with no notice and the usual reason ""the company is going in a different direction"".  "
bad,"They want you to take your tall load across the entire warehouse without it falling over. The system is heavily flawed. They give 30 minutes for 45 cases, then give 55 minutes for 325 cases. Most of the senior members take all the small loads and force the big loads on everyone else. Not to mention you'll be ther from noon til at least 2am. Bring a lunch"
bad,If your thinking about applying don't most unprofessional company I ever encountered. unsafe is only one part they will treat you like a animal or less.
bad,"Worked many hours OT and was never recognized for the hard work and OT I provided for UNFI.  It was a very stressful environment, fast paced and very little training, not to mention that management was the worst I ever worked for."
bad,Not a good place to work....poor management poor hours no advancements no pay was worth that type of work if u want to have surgery's on ur hands for carpel tunnel then do not work here ......
bad,"I was hired on to replace Employees who were on strike. They eventually came back and I was one of 20 that they kept to hire on. Well I was hired on and literally a week after, I was let go for reasons unknown."
bad,They are horrible abuse of labor. Run the only place I see employees come to work and  everyone that works there  wants to leave.alberts. is better.
bad,"New Rules Every Single Day. They Never Tell You When Your Doing A Good Job, Only Pointing Out The Wrongs. Management Does Not Care About Employees Especially Its Hardest Workers. Workload is So overwhelming that people just walk out. You won't see your family with this schedule. Management also talks to workers like they are above them outside of work. Other than that the people you work with is the best thing about this job"
bad,"Nation wide company with a dissatisfied work force, and sadly it shows through customers receiving damaged and incorrect products.  Turn over is abundant."
bad,"Extra long hours for terrible pay. No advance opportunity"
bad,good company but at the time i was working there shady mangment. also low on pay for the job your doing also no room to grow with company
bad,this company is very sad because managers R calling Mexicans and Hispanics disrespectfully. I was in charge of inventory control 2 analyst. the manager from transportation harassed me me against the corner try to intimidate me by his position and then when I call and took him to HR they suspended me and three days later they let me go because I turn the manager from transportation in for harassment discrimination assault intimidation and imprisonment. There's no way in the company to let a manager like him stay and he is known to lay his hand on individuals because he did get suspended for 10 days. I suggest not to work for this because if you do something wrong you will get let go. The supervisor for inventory control has no supervisory experience and if you pass her up she will do anything to get you fired because she was afraid that I put so many things in place and made her look bad she decided to go with the manager from transportation and lie about my job performance. Don't work for this place because it their all for managers and not for employees but this is a lesson to be learned. So stay away from this dirty rat please.
bad,They worst management you will every work with .disgrace to what they do to the people that actually run the place management always looking to pat each other on the back . The management is made up of people who have been fired from their jobs for being incompetent. It's a joke
bad,By far the worst job sarasota distribution is always having injuries and don't care about employees please look away
bad,"This Company is growing fast by buying up smaller company's. Managment is bad, The work load is constantley increasing with no additional help hired. HR is unhelpfull and strickly for the company. Benifits have been slowly taken away. the last notice not long ago that we were not getting our Christmas bonus. Everytime someone leaves Managment expects the remaining people to obsorb their work load. This Company is a huge corporation with a corprate mentality. STAY AWAY!"
bad,Stay away from this company!!! You have no life working there.
bad,It was get there and get to what you had to do with the quota given which it was not the issue. I liked doing that cause it was fun and fast paced. I had to get 200 cases of things in an hour and riding on a high rise forklift was dangerous and fun at the same time. management however ridiculed me for coming during a mid shift and get some empty boxes which resulted the loss of that job though it was a stepping stone to get to California. 
bad,I have worked here for almost 2 yrs they have required me to work mnths straight with no days off working up to 18 hr shifts. This D/C is also undergoing a strike lockout situation and for they are looking for scabs to cross the Union picket line....don't be a scab and don't help this company destroy the american middle class.
bad,i though it was a good company to work for put the management was not very good. they played favorites at time. they always thought that people were exaggerating on there times. and the forklift drivers were always complaining about something. the battery powered pallet jacks were cool but some were worse than others often people would get stuck with a messed up jack.
bad,For someone who is not well versed in the warehouse industry the pressure is on. They say they’re giving you two full weeks of training but that’s a lie. Job requirements are completely unrealistic and management doesn’t have a clue. There is no one there willing to help you when they put you by yourself to pick orders. It’s not worth the emotional stress if you can’t keep up to par with their job number system  stay away at all costs!
bad,"Fast paced freezer selector job. Pick items, wrap pallet and drop off in staging area. They work you long hours and expect you to reach impossible goals."
bad,Had great pay and benefits. They chose to terminate all of the 250+ employees while relocating over 50 miles away and hired all new employees with low wages and no benefits. The problems began once unfi bought out supervalu and started running the company into the ground.
bad,Not a great atmosphere. Many people were upset about the bad working conditions. Workers arent able to leave no matter how long they had worked already and also how long they were going to work. Training was not very good. Also not very informative about the points and all the varied points systems.
bad,"If you are not in the click of the managers and supervisors, you don't get good paying route and you get nothing but a part time pay with full time benefits."
bad,Watch your back!! They do not follow their own policies. They are constantly changing management positions. Very micro-managed. Would not recommend this company.
bad,"The worst management Ive ever delt with ... have no clue how to run a warehouse, spend too much time messing with employees rather than focus on how to run the warehouse better to keep the customers happy ... seems like harrassment to the employee is all that matters ... horrible benefits, point system is a joke and almost impossible to take time off for any reason"
bad,"Long days, never know when you're going home . Never know if your working weekends. Pour management, terrible schedule and they lie about a lot of things especially the days."
bad,"An experience at the UNFI Non-Food Warehouse in Stockton. "
bad,"The worst place I have ever worked. I'm a very patient person generally speaking but the management seemed to bring out the ""f'$& you"" in me. "
bad,"They are a horrible place to work. Worst job I ever had. Horrible work culture that does not value its employees. No work life balance at all. They are struggling and laying people off.  They laid off people who worked for them up to 20 years just so they could move their jobs to Rhode Island and get paid for ""creating new jobs"" in that state."
bad,"This is a slave warehouse where you do lots of hours with no notice, if you don't have a life and don't care how you get treated and all you want is money this may be for you, no life work balance at all"
bad,They always say things are getting better and nothing gets better they never tell you when your getting out or a general time to expect to go home like its a bad thing to want to go home and see your family after working for 13 or more hours everyday and then they are bringing in new people that dont want to work as hard as it takes so its slowing everyone down so much and making it harder for everyone else they just took money and valuable points and unpaid sick days away.. if you dont like your family or seeing your house other then to sleep then work here you can pay for your apartment/house but you wont see it the 5 days they schedule you for 13 plus hours from 9 am till whenever the works done but if you have no other options work here the people and some of the guys that have been there a while are acctually good people but not alot of selectors have made it longer then 6 months at the ct location
bad,"Lack of technology. Tagging is done by hand writing;. warehouse very disorganized and product is placed everywhere. Poor management oversight. To save money they don't use any RF scanners. You must tag everything by hand. Not enough equipment. Co-workers steal lunch bags, no respect in the work environment. I quit."
bad,They will drop you for any reason they dont care about you. Its a revolving door. Management is poor. Its not a long term job they make sure of this..
bad,"Management here is very bad , they want you to be at 95 percentile for productivity ..."
bad,"As a supervisor a typical day at work is fast past from the time you enter the building to the time you leave. UNFI is a circuit training boot camp.  This company cannot be taken seriously.  Regional level management actually the compensation is fair in comparison with the long hours worked and the mountains of work they are consistently assigning to you.  The culture is awful starting from the top level directors and managers down to the receptionist.  Lack of professionalism, confidentiality, recognition,  job security and overall safety.  The hardest part of the job was the long hours.  You could never be certain about your schedule or feel you had job security. If management do not like you they will plot to terminate you.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the benefits.   This by far is the worst place I have every worked.   If you are a robot this is your dream job otherwise run."
bad,"UNFI fosters a truly toxic environment. Most of everything they advertise as a good place to work is literally just words on paper. Just ask them what their turnover rate is? Or why they don't offer paid sick time (They are kind enough to allow you to use your vacation but it still counts against your attendance). Ask them how big their training department is (there isn't one) so you can feel comfortable about your on-boarding. They claim to be green but print everything out on paper. This happens because they've invested no capitol in technology (everything is done in dos systems or in excel). So if you're looking for a place that values it's employees (they spend nothing on employee appreciation day or customer service week) or invests in your development (again, no training dept. or trainers and no formal development process) you might want to look a little longer."
bad,UNFI is a fast pace work environment.  The typical work day is showing up and doing the task provided. and leave for some departments when the job is complete.  Some departments require overtime as others you only are required to work an 8 hour day.
bad,"Horrible place to work at no balance, unprofessional management, too much turnover and unsafe cold and freezer work, bad equipment, no opportunity to go anywhere else in the company."
bad,"If you quit do not use them as a job reference.  They will claim you intentionally sabotaged customers orders,  mispicked items,  etc.  90 degrees inside the warehouse,  claim they can't fix the electrical problems with the fans.  Filthy food warehouse,  ridiculous inventory system,  old product with outdated codes dating back 3 years +."
bad,This company does not care about the people that work for them. They have no appreciation for their employees. It's impossible to follow their unrealistic point system. Selectors are trying to make their numbers so they don't lose their jobs meanwhile a ton of mistakes are happening and customers aren't getting the product they wanted and are unhappy but UNFI doesn't care about any of it. All about the numbers.
bad,"As a customer care representative except to be treated horribly, you are responsible for a call card which is at least 100-200 calls a day. You have to stay in the queue all day as well so it's very hard to make the deadline times as trucks close. When you are in queue expect another 200 calls in between your own customer's. The management team does not help out at all. They just expect you to keep doing more and more. No guidance, no room for growth, you are a slave to UNFI."
bad,"I Worked for Earth Origins who is owned by UNFI. I worked in their Sarasota store and what a mess this place was. It should be condemned for infestation,and the employees and managers all need to enter a rehab program,since I would see managers hungover and employees calling in sick daily! Working in grocery I could see a bit of all departments. The deli was very gross and the supplement woman was in oblivious to it all. I blame it on UNFI for letting this store go down the tubes. Do yourself a favor and RUN..................."
bad,if you work for this company make sure you have no life because when you start you will have no life. All upper management could care less about anyone under them. The company does not care about its employees all it cares about is the bottom dollar. This was the worst job I ever had.
bad,The company used to be a great place to work. It has grown very fast and the people they have in place do no know the law. The treat their people unfairly and do not live up to their mission statement. The do not have a clue about the work/life balance.
bad,"If you want to know the truth about this place from the view of an employee, it is not much different from any other company out there. I was given the wrong impression about the company after being hired - being promised a sustainable work/life balance with the American dream in mind but the truth is that all changes once you're out on the floor. You have no autonomy or say-so in this DC whatsoever. Managers typically are related to one another and enforce the ""Run by Fear"" mentality, constantly threatening your job/livelihood and reprimanding you for any reason that they can find, on top of being understaffed and expecting miracles out of you (like doing the work of three people over the course of a 10-16+ hour shift when pallets and debris are blocking your way, no I'm not joking), and then writing you up for performance measures later when you don;t make rate whether or not you just gave them an honest effort is irrelevant. You are constantly looking over your shoulder being micromanaged to the point of near insanity. Stay away from this DC at all costs, while it does pay well, the emotional, mental, and physical abuse that they put you through is NOT worth it. Having to work on almost all holidays and being EXPECTED to drive miles through blizzards is absolutely insane. If you don't, their ""point system"" will see to it that you get in trouble or terminated for attendance, further adding to the list of problems. My advice to management is to STOP treating your employees like worthless cattle and to implement QUALITY management systems in your operation. I'm so much happier"
bad,You get to work in a over heated building with limited breaks. Yet they wanted you to get the job done in a timely manner without passing out.
bad,This place has to be the worst warehouse I have worked for in a long time. The management team does not care about their workers at ALL. Hours are VERY long  usually 12+ hour shifts all the time. You get very little sleep because you have to come back to work the next day after a 12+ hour shift day. I would 100% not recommend this place to anyone unless your short on money and have nowhere else is hiring but even that I would still avoid this joke of a company
bad,"A ruthless environment with unrealistic expectations. As a woman who measures 5""2 weighing at 150 with no experience in the warehouse business I felt overworked and burnt out by the first month and was expected to hit a certain quota on a daily basis in order to pass the 90 day probationary period."
bad,You can’t leave until work is done. Your scheduled for 10 hrs but u work 12-15 hrs everyday. All they care about is getting orders out. Attendance policy is horrible. The benefits are good but you won’t work there long enough to utilize them
bad,Nada mas que decir sólo somos números nada más tienes una lección y después que te recuperas buscan cualquier excusa parar despedirte
bad,"In my years of experience in the order selecting field, UNFI is by far the worst place to work. You come into work , they give some meaningless meeting which is always the same thing ""Be safe and make us look good"". There is no proper stretching program , it's all on you. Most of the equipment UNFI has doesn't work properly, so you must get there early and run around looking for a good enough pallet jack / fork lift.everything is always trashy looking , skids of product always in the way, always crowded, supervisors are always hiding, ... put it this way..if you want to work here get ready to ssy goodbye to your family and ssy hello to doctor bills  because you WILL pull something..enjoy your awesome job at UNFI...#STRESSFULL"
bad,"By far the absolute worst place I have worked at. All with the exception of 2-3 supervisors, the managers/supervisors have no clue as to what’s going on or how to even do their job. The company says they like to promote internally yet, in the time I worked there they brought in every single new supervisor and higher up manager in from outside the company. Only one of the employees got promoted to a supervisor because he spoke Spanish! Not to mention he hadn’t even been with the company for very long before getting promoted. The hours are just beyond ridiculous. If you have no life and like to work between 12-18 hours every single day then this is the job for you because it completely consumes your life. The hours were bad when I started, then they seemed to subside for awhile as we went into the ‘slow season’ (still working 40-50 hours a week) but since we joined with SuperValu the hours have been non-stop crazy. They took on too much work for this warehouse and they don’t want to admit it. They say that bringing more people in will bring down the hours, which it would if they could actually make them stay! But the reality is no one ever does because they see everyone else working these crazy hours. Honestly the place should just be shut down it’s super unsafe using the equipment for that many hours everyday and people getting barely any sleep, then getting scolded for coming in late. Racks shake every time a lift driver puts a pallet on it, there’s an infestation of rodents and birds, the janitors hate their job therefore do their job awful. The same spill could sit there for"
bad,"Poor decision in bring in a director that is awful.  He is rude a bully and is driving associates and managers out.  "
bad,"Piece work mentality in the distribution centers.  Cut throat corporate culture.  Endless conference calls, issues, and problems.  Two best days are the day you get there, and the day you leave.  Abusive managers are encouraged to act that way.  Pass"
bad,"The ridgefield location is so disorganized, they blame it on construction but it really is management. Work here and have no life working up to 16hrs a day, its the perfect place for you."
bad,UNFI was a good place to work for until the new management came in and change everything. You can be a good driver but the minute you mess up they throw it in your face. At first they will act like your friend just to get you in the door and once they do its a whole different world. Management has such a lack of respect for drivers. They talk to you as if they know how to do your job.
bad,Treat people like people not machines. No time for a one size fits all need to get messages across to all.Micromanagement will destroy a company  because of trust issues. Companies need to learn you cannot treat people like dogs and expect to get the best out of them.That mentality is insane indeed.
bad,"They work their employees like dogs. Long hours, working on Sundays. There is nothing good about working at UNFI. They expect way too much with their unreasonable quotas."
bad,unfortunately the shift seemed to go from doing what we could to assist the customer to what was easiest and cheapest for the company while shifting the blame if things didnt work out.
bad,"The only good thing about the job is the pay, but the pay isn't worth the stress and lack of sleep. They say they give you down time that very rarely gets put in and if it does, it doesn't count towards your incentive boost. People leave or get terminated frequently and the hours are ridiculous. 10/10 will never work there again."
bad,. Worst management ever. And the standards are way too high considering the conditions. Way too many hours worked in a day/week. Very unfair point system considering the overtime and the demand
bad,"The job pays well but the strain on your body is not worth it. They always push you to go faster, and the time limits they give you to complete a task are a bit unrealistic."
bad,"I worked at unfi for 2 months and in that time the only positive thing about the job was meeting new people. They expect you to work at least 15 hour days and dont care to he as r if toyre tired, they want your percentage up or they'll fire you. They want you to be fast all day a d lift thousands of pounds of product and build pallets all while a bunch of new people are driving around and holding everyone up. This place is designed to make you want to quit. I wouldnt recommend this job to anyone."
bad,"For me this was a terrible place to work although I have heard it is better in some departments.  Overall working environment was worse than being in junior high.  Lots of drama.  Management was terrible and pointed out your mistakes all the time.  Also thought we needed to be babysat all the time.  Company doesn't know what they are doing anymore and nobody really likes to work there unless your upper management than it's great.  Most people are very sarcastic and negative and unhappy.  It was the most stressful job I ever had.  Plus, they are a multibillion dollar company yet they pay pretty low for the amount of money they make and for the area we live in.  Probably the reason why they move some of the departments to the east coast, it's cheaper."
bad,If you think you're going to work 8 hours a  day 5 days a week forget about. You will be working anywhere from 13 to 17 hour days 5 times a week for over 75 hours. What kind of life is rhat.
bad,"The management team doesn't know what direction to take this company. Also the HR department doesn't know anything about rules, laws, nor regulations for the company. All together this company is not worth working for."
bad,"Poor equipment Work you to the Ground poor management trucks never on time shuttle drivers come in at 4 p.m. and leave the yard at 5:30 Ryder service yard was the worse place for service  , some days will work 14 or 15 hours a day trucks were loaded backwards and sometimes just stuff thrown in the trailer"
bad,"This place is horrible to work for. Their managers are spineless and don’t try to solve a problem you are having. Managers in one department will overstep their boundaries and try to tell employees in another department what to do. The pay is low compared to other facilities. There’s no job security. It seems if you work there for ten years and over, they’re trying to push you out. UNFI has already laid off people that’s been there for twenty years.  The attendance point system is very confusing and no one seems to have the right answers about it."
bad,This job is perfect for anyone who likes being treated really badly and does not have a family. They are always understaffed and require you to work your days off.
bad,"A typical day at work usually entails ""work until the work is done"" When coworkers call out you will work the extra hours until the work is finished. Decent benefits, around $14/hour to start. Do not expect to see too many smiling faces, its a job to pay the bills."
bad,"I worked for this company for years and then I quit.  I finally I got feed up with the nonsense . You work every holiday except New Years, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.  They don't care if a blizzard is outside they expect you to come to work. They are one of the cheapest company's ever. They give you 1% to 3% raises every year if you follow there rules. "
bad,UNFI is not a workplace conducive to maintaining mental health. the pressures put on the management and subsequently the work force are the tool they use for productivity.
bad,Terrible company to work for and horrible management.  I would not recommend this company to anyone.  There are much better places to work.  UNFI does not value their staff.
bad,"If you don't mind working a 17 to 19 hour shift, then this job is for you. They have an extremely high turnover rate. Management lies to you just to get you in the door. Management also lies to corporate, so they have no idea what's going on. Supervisors have no experience in warehousing, hence them not knowing anything. They pacify employees by playing music."
bad,"UNFI has a fantastic executive level of leadership. However the average employee deals with the Vice President to Area Manager Level which has a group of leaders who struggle with leadership skills."
bad,"UNFI is not a good places to work, your working long hours often working 12+ hours (that the norm not the exception like they say )never know when you will  be done . there is no work life balance . Management talks down and poorly to associates and often bad mouth about associates and former associates  in front of other coworkers  like all places they like to play favorites  . they do not take feed back if you bring something up they just tell you that is the way it is or  blow you you off.  They do pay good and do a a lot with volunteering in the community are the only good things i can say."
bad,Management only cares about packing every inch of the trailer not if you can deliver it or not. They play game with the drivers causing fights and firings. Costumes hat the games the sales team play by over ordering and making the drivers clean up the mess. It's not worth the headache and aggravation!!
bad,"Long unappreciated hours even after dedicated, record breaking work, no compensation reviews, HR is a joke, and the morale is horrendous."
bad,"Used to be a GREAT place to work !!!!.the current management at ALL levels has"
bad,"Worst company ever! They make you work ridiculous hours and the pay sucks! Management is horrible, they don't communicate with their employees. If you're interested in working like a slave, be my guest but I would not recommended you work here."
bad,I would not work there. Company moral sucks! Too much favoritism . They force you to work extremely long hours.
bad,"UNFI is not an employee friendly company - they are focused on their $$ goals and nothing else. They do not care if their employees have families or other responsibilities outside of their job. The turnover is extremely high and they have very low employee satisfaction. Management is replaceable and if you go slightly against what they want you to think, you are gone... without hesitation."
bad,You are treated like slaves here. There is no advancement. No crosstraining. You work 16 hours a day. Are held to an unrealistic production standard. Injuries are extremely common. Always people on light duty because of that. Pay might be good but you'd be better off poor and happy rather than worked like this. No appreciation whatsoever. I've worked here for 2 years and am constantly looking for a way out. I don't recommend this place or wish it upon my worst enemy.  Stay away!!
bad,take advantage of u great money but forced me to work 6 days a week 15 hour days. never saw my daughter and she lives with me
bad,"From one of the best jobs I ever had, to a place that gives me nightmares. It's a revolving door, filled with felons from 3rd party travel teams. If you look at the company stock, it'll explain most everything. Seems like SuperValu bought UNFI, not the other way around."
bad,"too much violence in the work place. very unsafe place to work, there is no supervision. total chaos . There is a lot of discrimination going on in the workplace. I would never work there again unless there is a lot of changes. UNFI for being a food distribution is a very filthy warehouse. broken damages in the racks damaged product just lying around for weeks, causing a bad health violation, something needs to be done."
bad,"This job gives you no life at home with family "
bad,Twelve to sixteen hour shifts five days a week! Management keeps promising things will get better at the same time as wanting you to work harder and faster.The pay is great but you give up all social and family life and your body starts to wear down.
bad,"Overall, your just a number there. Some of the people are decent and a couple good ones. However, the stress from pressure that’s placed on selectors is absurd. It’s an artificial timetable anyway. No matter HOW FAST the order is picked, (or slow), it doesn’t matter because it ultimately will sit on the dock until the truck shows up to get it. ( usually it’s hours and hours up to a whole day) . The difference between getting a “bonus “ or getting “reprimanded “ is minutes and doesn’t affect the flow of business. It’s insane."
bad,"Good company for make money ,but no time with ur family,hours are crazy ,up to 80 at week ,they pick favorites,hard to move to first shift,at lease you are best friend with supervisors even u are the lazy employe In the floor,never organize,no time to go home ,easy you start at 11:00am and go home around 2:00am sometimes 5:00am ,morning to morning,they fire you if u call off after work 20 hours ,not professional place"
bad,"Good job for you if you don’t mind your schedule randomly changing. Not to mention an awful way of order selecting since the device is programmed to never hear you correctly. Management is just as bad, almost like they are the jocks of the high school and will talk poorly about others even in front of people"
bad,"The money is good (used to be better) but it's not worth the wear and tear on your body or getting bullied by higher management who can't run a business. If u suffer from anxiety, stress, paranoia, etc, then this is not the job for you because this job will worsen it. The managers and supervisors talk to you however they want, fire you if you don't work how they want you to work (or simply if they just don't like you), gives out unnecessary write ups, unnecessary changes to the company and punishments for reasons that doesn't make any sense. They give out points where if u get up to 10, you're automatically terminated. They give out a few for ridiculous reasons but one of the few things you get points for is taking a day off for personal reasons such as family emergencies, having an illness, etc. The bosses don't wanna hear that even if you ask them. They're gonna want u to come to work anyways or u will be dealt with. They can care less if your family member is on their death bed or if you're not in the right state of mind to work; they want you to work. That place has been opened for way too long for the management to still be as questionable as it is. That place is a prison but if you wanna be a slave for them, go right ahead."
bad,"I have worked there for a good amount of time and I can tell you they have good benefits. However there is no time to use them. If you have a family or spouse, be prepared to hardly ever see them. They work until done, that means if it takes 17 hours to finish the work your there for at least 17 hours. The company says it is a 10-12 hour job. They do have those rare days of 12 hours but those are few and far between. Management always talks about ""if you hit rate we can be out of here at a good time."" They expect you to run for 14-20 hours a day doing heavy lifting and don't want to hear anything about you being tired. Their turn over rate is bad for a reason and those of us that don't quit suffer for it. While management and higher ups leave when they want, supervisors work in shifts so they aren't there the entire time that the warehouse associates are(~8 hr shifts). The average work day is anywhere between 14 and 20 hours a day. If its the beginning of the week (Sun,Mon) expect a longer day. I have found myself and coworkers being thankful for a 15 hour day. They work you 5 days a week, the 5th day is an 8 hr day(tho they try to get you to work longer). If you train in any other area aside from Grocery you will be required to help that area finish then help Grocery finish i.e get freezer's work finished then get cooler's work finished then get grocery's work finished before you can go home. We generally work with a small crew (which changes in size a lot) and they (corporate) just keeps adding to our work load by adding more stores and still expects us to be done in 10 hours."
bad,one of the fastes workers  got fired for someone that did not like the job and was always looking for problems . and management did not do anything to prevent this from happening.
bad,"You're treated as though you're an animal, and told you're replaceable daily. There is NO training, at all. You're left to fend for yourself. They allow their employees to bully others. Interal interviews are not taken serioulsy, I was very literally laughed at in my recent internal interview for a slightly higher position, and was told I need to already know how to do the job to be considered for it. ...... what?"
bad,"UNFI York is not an enjoyable place to work, the employees are treated in a disrespectful and belittling manner. Definitely not the place for advancement."
bad,Management is terrible . No one cares in that place at all . If you do work here do not be a selector horrible conditions . Your incentive is capped and the cooler quota is impossible . You get 53 minutes to select 450 cases . They hire just about anyone they don't care about the employee . The pay suck for what you do .
bad,they where not willing to work with me and the bus scheuld...... most of the managment fely yhay they where better then everyone els..
bad,"I worked for this company nearly 10 yrs in various departments, some good times for sure, but constant management changes, departments understaffed, impossible job expectations & minimal support from managers & supervisors.  Shipping guys will some days be required to work 15 plus hrs/night, lots of stress & cannot say how happy I am to no longer be there.  I transferred departments and my new manager Ada H. agreed that I could have a 45 min. lunch break (combining my 2nd break with my lunch period), then denied this agreement when HR inquired about my ""long"" lunches.  This was the final straw when I decided to quit.  Mgr's will sound great & seem nice in person, but watch your back & get any agreements in writing."
bad,long days 12 to 15 hours a day. Seen alot of good managers come and go.
bad,"*order select for supermarkets "
bad,"Todos los dias trabajas 12 o+ al dia ahy trabajas asta 20 horas en un solo dia no le reconmiedo este trabajo a nadie, si tienes familia muchos menos no vas a tener Vida esto es un trabajo para perros y despues que trabajas 20 horas "
bad,"The supervisors/ leadership team lacks the knowledge to inform employees of their rights or their responsibilities.  The high up leadership is terrifying in how they treat their employees like children sometimes.  Stuff was taken without permission, by the main boss, because they didn't like where it was stored in the lunchroom.  The freezer is poorly taken care of as well"
bad,"At unfi, the dispatchers and management are so clueless and incompetent that they couldn't manage thier way out of a paper bag. If you want to be belittled and treated like crud daily then this is the place for you!  They also don't abide by fmcsa regulations, so have fun! I wouldn't recommend a position with these a@@hats to my worst enemy!"
bad,"Management seemed very optimistic, but made so many promises they couldn't keep. Shifts got longer not shorter, revolving door of new hires quitting the second they hear you stayed till 3am. I was honestly really excited at first but then it became more dreadful each day. I'd go back if they got their business working like 90% of the rest of the world. But the single shift doing all the work is unacceptable."
bad,Keep to yourself do the job.   Very cliquie   Do not trust anyone .  Hr is the worst. Do not give any personal information about your self or family. If needed they will use it against you.
bad,Les dare dos semanas de training y el dinero bueno que generaran no es complaciente con ese equipo de supervisores ni el tipo de trabajo donde nonse valora al empleado y trabajan basado en amenazas y burlas. Hace falta el buen dinero pero piensenlo antes de entrar a Unfi en York PA.
bad,This place is horrible. Management doesn't do anything for employees you are just a number. Good pay but not worth the stress. They will never allow you to go home. Will work you 18 hours and fire you for coming in late the next day.
bad,management not the best but improving. hours suck during season. supervisors have no voice. some supervisor know what they are doing. associates are great but work to hard
bad,they're always trying to get new hires fired for the simplest reasons they don't want to hear any excuses you're always wrong they're always right yet the company is still failing as a whole.
bad,At the start of my 14 years it was a wonderful comany to work for. I actually invisioned myself retiring from here.  After several changes in management it progressively went down hill. They would keep employees who should have been let go and let go of all their productive employees. Their job hours in certain departments and requirements are not realistic and not safe.
bad,"Don't be fooled by the signing bonus and higher hourly rate..."
bad,"I quit UNFI after 10 months of working there as selector. I was on a 10 hrs 4 day schedule but in reality I was working 12 to 14 hours and on top of that management decided to take one of my 3 days off away due to poor staffing. The over turn there is ridiculous; every other week they bring about 15 new employees but only 1 or 2 stay. Management doesn’t  get involved at all unless an accident happens or the company is getting audited. I didn’t like the culture there neither, people seem to be in a bad mood and give you attitude for no reason, this because the long hours and little rest they get, not to mention all the pressure they work on to meet unrealistic quota. I contacted the Union (teamsters) a few times to complaint about the work conditions but they did absolutely nothing about it. Overall, I would never recommend this company."
bad,"I applied and took the job because I  fell on hard times and the pay they promoted was outstanding but boy was I in for a rude wake up call the orientation part everything seemed cool and the managers showed there nice side only because the big bosses where around and to make it seem as if they had your best interest at heart but as soon as you start its a spit in the face and a  kick in the behind if you get sick your screwed because theirs a very unfair point system that does not make any kind of sense regardless and despite a drs note, they have favorites and the ppl handing out the work look out for there buddies and hand off the giant shots to the new guys or the ppl they dont like and save the short easy runs for the guys they know leading to certain chosen few to have high incentives and the newer guys get crapped on the managers back up there favorites too and are ready to throw you right under the bus to save there selves and positions sickening job I will never recommend a person here its abuse and they know it.I am currently looking for a new job soon as i get the chance i'm out of here!!!! If i even make it that long! worst place ive ever worked hands down."
bad,Horrible place to work. Will work you like a dog day in & day out. Zero work life balance. 15+ hour days are normal for minimal compensation. Management is disfunctional.
bad,"The only thing good about this job as far as I'm concerned is the benefits. Other than that, this job is a complete disaster. The supervisors and managers talk to u however they want as if you're a prisoner. They don't care if u got something personal going on at home or if you're sick. If u don't come to work, you'll get a point or a write up. They just make an easy job hard for others with all the unnecessary ruling. Also, if u don't mind your money being played with, then this is the job for u. They will condense the hours on your pay check so u won't get paid as much. I don't wish this concentration camp of a job on my worst enemy."
bad,"The only good thing about working here was to gain experience in my career field.  I have no idea how those who are in Management were able to get there. It was an awful work environment, unless you were a favorite. I do not suggest working here if you want to grow professionally. This place is a joke, especially in regards to the HR department."
bad,"HR doesn't do their job, people get hurt left and right and they don't care, they just fire 10 and hire 15 more then wait for that bunch to burn out before repeating the process. Management talks about people who have been let go, which is illegal, and they don't pay you when they're supposed to. They expect you to work 14 hours and still hit rate without providing reasonable breaks. Worst job I've ever worked."
bad,it is not a easy day but its a great pay check you work very hard but at the end of the day you are paid to do a job it not about who like you its about producing numbers
bad,"Just last year we were working a lot of hours but only straight pay. But after the first of the year they had to start paying us overtime after 40. So now they cut all of our hours way down to between 40 and 48, but some weeks you won't even get 40. So drivers are losing between 10,000 to 20,000 a year out of their paychecks. The only good thing UNFI had going for drivers was the good paycheck, now that the paycheck is gone drivers won't be far behind. To make up for the cut hours the hired around 50 to 60 new drivers but have a hard time keeping them."
bad,"Your racing time get a good percentage while the reach lift drivers chill and get in your way. There's always shorts and when you lose time picking them. Supervisors will say they give you time back, but they don't. You pick other people's slack if your a good selector, and if you don't Supervisors and Management will be on your back. You never really know when your getting out.  Since people call in , quit , or get fired...mostly get fired.  Yeah you get good benifits , but your going to need them for all that tole your body takes from the labor."
bad,poor managent and hr fails to help its employees fix and or deal with situations that are created by the job itself...way to many hours.good luck it is way under staffed
bad,"Picking "
bad,"Corporate nit picking at its finest! They are so hung up on the minutia they only care about getting the sale stuffing the truck and whining when you can't get finished within the 14 hour DOT limit. If I wanted to hand truck every item into a store I'd go work for SYSCO or US Foods and get overtime. Yeah no overtime straight time. Equipment, liftgate trailers and pallet jack is poorly maintained and always breaks down. Customers are fed up with getting wrong items on a weekly basis but are stuck with no other vendor for items they need. Money is good benefits are good but everyone in the office is a chief and there's no Indians. Not worth the headache better off somewhere else"
bad,Only work four days a week but you are under constant pressure and scrutiny. The benefits are amazing and affordable. There's also a danger factor. Every where you look heavy machinery is speeding around. People have been injured.
bad,"Company growing too fast  can't keep up with itself, HR very much its own Clique non supportive and  Associates run ramped with telling managers what they will do or not do.... Zero accountability , area Directors ARE CLUELESS."
bad,"I work worked for this company for a year and a good portion of the time I enjoyed it. However, upper management only cares about the financials and drive impossible deliverables to the facility staff and terminates staff for not being able to do two job roles at the same time."
bad,"UNFI has grown by buying out many former independently owed companies across the U.S. and Canada. I work as a driver for years and the strike of 2012-2013 turned mgmnt @ this location vindictive and cold towards everyone. Even pre-strike it wasnt a great envirinment, but post strike it's almost unbearable. Mgrs increased work loads on drivers by cutting routes and consolidating customers by giving big corp. accts priority and ignoring ""Mom and Pops"" who were the backbone of the company. Mgrs say they have an open door,  but no matter what the issue, you wont get a good, clear answer. Often it seems they fix things that arent broken.  Very micro-managed by self important office workers who look down on Drivers."
bad,Newly formed enterprise lots of struggles and hurdles. Rude management and no compassion for employees.
bad,If you dont want a life and be with your family then that's a great place to work..supervision is horrible..they dont have no supervisor skills or communication skills .H.R quits what that tell you..negative place to work.if you love your life and have a life..if you work there you will not have a life..AT ALL..
bad,You'll never advance as a buyer unless you came in as a waitress. Seriously the most difficult interview for one step up ladder position while already having worked under both interviewers. Complete joke. Don't bother.
bad,Would not work for this company again unless it went under new management and more reasonable hours. Not a people place they only care about production and not there employees
bad,The work was steady and engaging. The benefits were great. This is not a place to work if you have children who get sick or if you get sick. Point system is ridiculous! They love to give you points for being sick or if you are 4 minutes late to work.
bad,"Safety Rules are heavily spoken about but not enforced unsafe work environment. Warehouse reminds me of High-school watch what you say not what you do if you are not in a clique you get a big target on your back, singled out and made fun of."
bad,"If you can make it through the war zone, you may succeed. I can only speak for the DC were I worked. It could use better management, for future assets. The workplace culture is like high school and unorganized. The pay and benefits are the only thing that will keep you motivated here. If you have dreams and drive, the best advice is to get in and get out."
bad,The problem within the sales organization lies with the fact the you have top heavy management with no experience in the natural food industry. You do however have massive egos.
bad,I didn't like the job. Great pay but OT is why you make it. Managers are disrespectful and don't care about employees. Not a great company to work for.
bad,"Very long hours, constant threat of job security. Mgtmnt. is nonexistent. At the end of the day, all that is important, is if you hit rate. This is not a family friendly job. You are treated like a robot, with no concerns of health. 15/17 hr. days is the norm not the exception. The employees are and should be any business's prime concern, but at the end of the day, all that counts, is if you hit rate all night. If your looking to make some money,  your single, and you don't mind being talked down to, this is the job for you. Doesn't matter how good a worker you are, in time, they will figure out a way to terminate you. Supervisor's for the most part, try to help, as they to are going thru just about the same thing. But can only do so much."
bad,"Day averaged from 10 to 14 hours. Lack of company communication, training for route driving and safety. Great pay and benifets"
bad,"The pay is good, but then it has to be for all the BS you have to put up with. Any decent person won't make a career out of unfi. They don't care about their employees, all they care about is that you make the numbers and if you're not making the numbers and you're not a butt kisser then you wont make it with this company in Atlanta."
bad,Will fire you no matter the situation or the amount of years put in. Great pay but for the work you do it's fair. Management is a total joke. Their point system for calloffs is a joke
bad,"During the interview everything sounds sweet. The job, pay, benefits and people seemed so great but then you start the job and the true colors are shown. Management is a joke.HR who? They are non existent. Don’t call out even if sick they will write you up and you can be terminated even with doctors notes! They make zero accommodations for their employees but expect so much from you. Like I said pay and benefits are great but the people, company awful"
bad,Supervisor & management in higher authority use and abuse privileges and power. No integrity!!!! Supervisor has their own selected associate to get their job done because they’re lazy & just want to sit behind the desks. I experience alot at UNFI because it allowed me to not be subjective to such unprofessionalism
bad,"Managers suck and everyone is so rude and disrespectful and there is so much favoritism. Lunch is only 30 minutes for a 10 to longer hour shift and no one follows safety guidelines, and God forbid you get injured you're lying about it and no one gets drug tested"
bad,"First off, drivers are not given assigned routes until they have reached seniority.  Every day is a different route, different start time, in a different truck. Route supervisors will lie to you just to get you to do a route and even change your DOT hours so you can work longer.  Loads are loaded very poorly with boxes mixed in from other stops, meaning there's lots of sorting to do at each stop. Trucks are filthy, and poorly maintained.  They give little regard to DOT regs and rarely fix maintenance issues, even if they are critical.  You are expected to be on call at any time of the day or night, with supervisors sometimes expecting you to be in within the next 2 hours. Not a place I could recommend with a good conscience. HR is the worst, barely responding ever to issues."
bad,They micro manage all employees. Management is AWFUL and the workplace is full of drama. It is not an enjoyable atmosphere and you can’t trust anyone you work with including supervisors and managers.
bad,The working  conditions were poor and they expected you to do every job and not get paid as though you did. The company would make it so that you had to work overtime and you had very little time with your families if you worked night and it was hard to request time off.
bad,"Employer took on an abundance of new work with the same one shift of employees to get the work done, resulting in working 17 hour days. We are always short staffed because no one wants to work the long hours, very little time at home between shifts to rest and recover. Most people have families and children that they get to spend very little time with."
bad,"I think the worst place ever work in my life definitely need a new management, need to make this place more safer . If you want to sacrifice your life for some cash this is place for you but you will regret in the end"
bad,"They fired me for ""being distracting"", without prior discipline. Be cautious who you talk to, I suppose. I think it was because I made the mistake of wearing skinny jeans on Friday."
bad,This place was the worst place I've ever worked for. You have no home life if you are driver the management over the drivers Sheen even be in their position. Plain and simple this company doesn't care about your needs or your well-being the only thing they care about is the value of their loads and their contracts and making their money. As far as home life you don't have one you're working constantly all crazy hours anywhere from 12 o'clock in the morning until the afternoon their schedules are terrible. And you have no way of planning anything for your own family because all you're doing on your off days are sleeping. I would suggest to anyone who is considering working for this company not to consider it and look elsewhere. Don't work for a company that does not care about your knees or your well-being or anyone else's Therefore your benefits for yourself and your family would not be met. And as far as the slogan they have on their trailers about more play is a lie and is false advertisement.
bad,"-Management was ridiculous. "
bad,"Horrible management, and no one can run the place. Human resources is beyond corrupt. Treated unfairly. They tell you what you want to hear, but don't actually fix anything. Does not care about their employees, and was told in a staff meeting that we are all replaceable."
bad,a normal day is supposed to be 9:30 to 8 but you don't really leave until the work is done. so you could be working 12-15 hour shifts. some nights you don't even get a full 8 hours of sleep just to go back to work the next day. were force mandatory days on our days off.
bad,No work life balance but they sell you on that dream during the hiring process. They hold you hostage until work is finished. By the time you leave there is only time to nap before going back to work. I got a demerit point for calling in during a bad snow storm when every other business shut down for the day.
bad,"I enjoyed working here... while I was an employee. New upper management laid off our entire department for the west coast. Then started going through the warehouse and eliminating ""excess labor"". Not a very stable job which is a shame since I rather enjoyed my team and management. A friendly atmosphere before we were all treated as disposable."
bad,Not a good job. Not a job for anyone who values quality of life. They do not care about the people doing the hardest jobs in the company.
bad,out to get each other type mangment. in fighting and backstabbing.....evil
bad,"I went through a temp agency (which I didn't know was a temp agency until I arrived at their office) at the time and they got me set up for an interview almost immediately which ended up being this place. I interviewed with the warehouse manager at the time and I don't think the interview was more than 20-30 minutes. After we were finished with the interview, he gave me a brief tour around the different sections of the warehouse. He was going around to other selectors telling them I'm showing the new hire around, He didn't even tell me he's hired me but evidently he did. Within a couple days I was told to attend basically a safety/company presentation, because there's lots of forklifts and the smallest one is a pallet jack and it is the same one you'd use as a selector, which weighs as much as a car. Anyways, I'm about 3-4 days into the very thorough hands on training to drive the pallet jacks, how to navigate around obstacles in isles, rounding corners, turning, yielding, etc. and I start to feel a cold coming on rather quickly and not subsiding despite the medication I had to carry with me. Now, the instructor who I advanced on with amongst other trainees, had already backed me up when another selector was telling me what to do as if she's my boss when I'm not even out of training yet. My instructor told me she use to be an instructor but ""then she got injured"", you know how that goes. Some time after that scenario with my instructor having my back while clearly coughing my lungs out, my same training instructor told me I'm not supposed to be eating candy in the warehouse..."
bad,"clock in, get on forklift and heat up computer and start pulling stock for stockers. What i learned is that they do not care about you or the truth only that u touched it a week ago and now you have to go cause it danaged property??"
bad,Unfi has horrible management they expect you to his 95% everyday but make it there mission to make sure you do not succeed they force you to come In on ur day off an if you don't they make it there mission to get rid of you do not trust a word they say it's not a family it's there way or your fired

bad,"It's a great place to work, with the wages being fair, but the hr Dept and the time clock system are not right. I'm frequently missing hours and bonus pay every week. This is a common occurrence,and issue, not just for me, but many others as well. Only stay because it's still better than most places. I hope that hr can get their heads out of their butts, and get the systems working properly."
bad,They will work you to the bone and can you when you are exhausted.  You are just a number to them.  No fun. Management was good up until a few months ago.
bad,Managers worst hr just as bad... I heard it was a decent place...I didn’t mind the work but the managers brought their personal issues and feelings to work....
bad,"Distribution center in Hopkins, MN treat there workforce poorly. Supervisors openly disrespecting/mocking union workers. "
bad,"This place actually used to be a fairly great place to work. I work in a small office with a few other people and I used to enjoy my work. Now? Not so much. You can tell at the environment of the warehouse people are starting to lose their drive to care which is leading to poor decisions and poor work ethic."
bad,"Long Hours, Overly heavy workload, insane expectations, Rude managers, Terrible VPs. One Law for them and another for us. Don't work here, you will be chewed up and spit out faster then you can say work life balance."
bad,Your day starts at 11am till done no set hours the turn over is hiiiiggghhhhh tooo mannnyy hours but if u need some quick money come and swing cases they dont mind paying ot
bad,"Truck drivers do not work a consistent schedule, which means you will be expected to adapt to different sleeping patterns every day. This is a VERY unsafe practice for a driver. They will work you to death and not allow you to have a regular sleep pattern. Home life or social life? Not with these guys.  You will be married to your job.  Professional drivers, steer clear of this driver abusing circus.  Your life is worth more.  Oh, and if the f'd up scheduling wasn't bad enough, they have in can cameras pointing right at your face so they can spy on you all night.  No wonder they are desperate for drivers..."
bad,"Not a company you want to work for. Allows bullying behavior, and doesn't take care of the main bully. Discriminates if you have medical issues. If you speak up they follow you around as if your the problem. If you want to go to a job and work hard and do everything you can to be a good employee this is not the company for you. Do not waste your time!"
bad,Was hired as a full time driver but was never told it was only seasonal. Was let go after the holiday season was over along with 5 other drivers.
bad,"At first I loved my job, they closed 3 warehouses and told 3 unions that it sucks to be them and got sued lost the lawsuit, appealed, was losing again and sold the company to get out of it, as well as hr yelling at employees who were not performing their duties as well as usual due to their house being flooded with the heavy rain, and if you don't meet the 100% standard every week you will be fired  100% is nearly impossible to meet given that the facility is 1.2 million square feet and you have about 1 second at each station for both transit and loading the product  , "
bad,Neveragain....and I would never refer any one to work there...too much going on there.....you have supervisor that act like regular employees. ....smh....the hours are ridiculous for someone with a life....now someone thats single would prolly love it
bad,"Everyone knows UNFI has it's issues but we (drivers) has voted in the union local 445 as of July 7, 2016 because of the distrust and abuse we get everyday thru management, so big changes will come very soon!!!!! ...... We as drivers demand respect!!!!"
bad,"If you have no life outside of work this job is for you! 5 months strait of 72+ hours a week. You go in at 9am and get home between 12-3 am with (usually) no offer to come in late the next day. Very physical job, with the long hours and no sick days its impossible to make incentives without killing yourself. Would be a great company if they listened to their employees ideas of how to improve moral and productivity."
bad,Make money working 6 days a week 12-20 hours a day. No time for anything else including sleep. Never close for blizards or other harsh weather and work holidays. Super fun.
bad,"The pay was decent but top off at 5 years no more raises, not even a cost of living. Insurance overpriced for how bad it is. too many mandatory hours (was working 70ish every week for almost a year before quit). Very fast paced to get rates. Ran poorly. Wonder why it's ALWAYS understaffed and forcing outrageous over time on everyone?"
bad,Attendance policy and strict rules. Management states they are willing to work with employees but there is NO place for advancement and management is NOT willing to work with employees regarding work/life balance.
bad,no room to grow. management unorganized disrespectful.lack of knowledge from supervisors. all employees need team building skills with management and team supervisors.
bad,Place sucks the culture and management are unbalanced great facility and equipment but there is no future here pretty much no job security if you have a family and want to take days off pretty much you have to take points they run on a 10 points a year system revolving door turn around rate is very high.pretty much no life first shift is at 3am second 11am Raider Nation!!!!
bad,"When you start like most jobs , you will like it . They start off telling you about all this opportunites of advancemenf and etc when you get in .. its a whole different story . "
bad,Strict policies and extrodanary low performance increase (and slary)not to exceed 3% EVER.  Nice crushed ice machine.  Job is rote.  Not very creative.  Meet deadlines!
bad,"Your up against the system, called the “standard” which has no understanding of obstacles in your way, mechanical breakdowns and voice system errors. This company has a high turnover rate and as always poorly managed."
bad,"this started out as great job new management sucked they want more and more out of you sometimes 14 hr days you have no life outside of work mandatory overtime all the time they deny your request for time off because they cant hire enough people to cover you, I wouldn't recommend this company ever to anyone if they would like more out of there life than just work."
bad,Moreno Valley unfi has the worst management in that facility. They are out to get everyone don’t believe me give it a try and see for your self. Give it a good month and your looking for another good. VERY HIGH turn over rate. Just take my word for it not a place if your lazy and don’t wanna work hard even that they will still try to get you fired for points “attendance”. Which is high at Moreno Valley. Good luck.
bad,"Worked there for 3 months, boss laid off, continued to work there for 9 months with additional responsibilities and no increase in pay and no opportunity to learn, grow, or join meetings. Raised concerns on my work life balance - no follow up from management. Then I was laid off."
bad,"If you do not mind working lots of hours and having your job threatened for every issue that comes up, then this is the place for you. No work/life balance. Management expects 1 day of training and 100% of production met on the next day. Turn over is out of control and it takes a month or more to find replacements. The new management manages by intimidation and has created a very negative and hostile work environment."
bad,"This company sucks if you expect longevity,  and security!! It's a revolving door at that place. I worked there almost two years and in that period of time I think I seen over 200 people come and go. "
bad,"A typical day includes taking incoming calls from customers, usually to place orders, verifying that customers have their orders in before the truck is ""closed,"" sending order confirmations, etc."
bad,Company is not truthful about incentive pay.  Work is too hard for the incentive and it is a joke when you do get it.
bad,Co-workers are what keep u going. The hardest thing about the job is the hours and the physical demand on ur body. Some room for growing if they want you to. Not because u are a great worker. Safeway pays the order selectors 16.50$ to start. 
bad,"Over all a good company ,but the staff don't know what to do or they don't feel like doing their jobs . They don't care about most employees the only thing is you picking those cases . because when it comes to an employee getting sick or a family member going to the ER. They take you're points away until you have no more points they fire the people who actually  work than those who slack all day at work."
bad,"Unfi was a good place to work, been there for a few years now. These days the managment team does not seem to care about the people who work there. Hr has made themselves unavailable, maintenance manager refuses to fix things. You are a roster spot not a person. No real work life balance. Unrealistic expectations to workers. The safety team is the only team that seems to care. It's a really sad mind numbing place to work."
bad,To many hours to work with short staff... 1 ...15 min break and 1.. 30 min break and then they expect u to work overtime with short notice. When you see Food know you gonna be working OVERtime 15 -16 hours some days and then expect u to be up and ready and on time for YOUR next shift with little to no sleep. REPEATING TO SAME THING THE NEXT DAY. SMH...HIREPEOPTRTGELIKE YOU NEED TGEM
bad,"After working as an order selector for a few months I was given the opportunity to bid for clerical posisition. Awesome!?"
bad,"They expect you to work 14 hour shifts consecutively, the incentives are a joke, the managers are no help, and after working 14 hour shifts they expect you to clean the warehouse after while the managers just sit in the office cracking jokes. I should of applied to capstone instead."
bad,I worked there for 3 months never knew who's was my supervisor thats how bad management is. Never know when you going home. They don't used RF scanners to pick you have to tag everything manually . long hours. .
bad,"Very unsecured line of work, it is all about the numbers and you are at the mercy of the accounts you work with. Work environment is very hostile and stressful."
bad,I couldn't believe the things I saw at this place.  An extremely dysfunctional management team.  The hours are crazy.  I had an employees work 45 in 2 days.  I would not recommend this place to anyone.
bad,At first hours were crazy and the work was extremely over barring. It took company approximately 3 Months to make some changes to my unbearable schedule. Finally company made some changes and we lost the contract. Very unfortunate they UNFI only gave us a 2 week notice of loss of employment and a lousy 2 week severance package.
bad,"Long Hours if on 2nd shift. 9 to 15 hour days with split shift. "
bad,"UNFI is hard to work for under an unfair and harsh PTO system. If you have a family they don't support you. Hope you or your children never get sick. There isn't really any advancements, what you were hired for is where you stay."
bad,Made to work well over 12 hours a day 7 days a week with no work-life balance and an inexperienced management team to make it even worse. Felt like every day my job was at stake and the stress level was through the roof. The employees outside of management all worked together and looked out for each other and the warehouse was always well kept and clean.
bad,I go to work for 8:30 and leave at 5pm. I sit at a computer and do customer service and data entry all day. Customers call with problem or special requests and I would do my best to take care of it.
bad,"i wouldnt recommend this job to my worst enemy , its all about who knows who & who worked with who in the past . management is not knowledgeable of any department they run . their in those positions cause of who they know & not cause of their experience"
bad,"Office personnell is no help and the turn around is quick. They give out awards for telling on other employees. Also, they work you without providing you with appropriate sleep."
bad,"you'll cap out in pay in just a couple years and see no raises. Management is very clicky, they all sit around in each other's offices all day laughing it up while their employees bust their backs. They make fun of employees behind closed doors and won't go to bat for you unless your a favorite. They expect you to go above and beyond on a daily basis. Loads are late everyday as they can't keep warehouse pickers to save their butts. Your off days are typically Saturday and a random day during the week. Sundays and fridays are the biggest days and you'll always be late leaving. People walk around talking bad about the company and management constantly. Seems everyone is always looking for a job."
bad,"At first this company seemed to be a good place but I've realized it has many flaws and needs improvement. Starting pay is $14.80. High School like environment with a very uneven/heavy work load. Management incompetent, not available or doesn't care. Very strict attendance policy and will not make exceptions no matter how good of an employee you are. Lack of opportunity leading to a dead end job with an annual 3% raise at best. They offer a lot of broken promises when it comes to training and opportunity. Management gossips and engages in rumors along with the rest of the staff.  There is also no acknowledgement if you work hard and excel at your job. Not all employees are held to the same standards. There are some who get away with anything while others are reprimanded often. Some staff can surf the internet all day while others are too busy to take a break. This company will get you experience but I would not recommend working here for more than 3 years."
bad,Not enough employees to get the job done for the results asked by Management.  Typical day was 10-13 hours due to the overload of work that Supervisor was doing that should of been delegated to Management role.   Difficult part was no support from Management and the most enjoyable was the team of 15 that I supervised.   Team Players work together.
bad,UNFI is a company that has reverse discrimination. I was treated like a outsider from day one. They expect you to work until 3 every night. The workers won't move out of your way and are nasty. The management is a joke.
bad,started out great doing 4 10 hour days then it went to 4-14 hour days then mandatory 5th day... some I was working 75 hours a week and asked to work a 6th day... but what's best is being a top 10 guy in my warehouse I went home sick 1 day to return to find out I was let go because other said I quit... lady from hr said she tried to call me but never did. they want to over work you and our incentive rates sucked... out of 100 ppl only 10 of us made incentive.. some days I'd start at 11am and leave at 4/5 am and still be expected to get back 11am ... management is fresh so they have a lot of bugs to work out.. we'd have nights where your done you clean up and they call you back to work on 2 more trucks cause they just found them
bad,"Greenwood DC.  Stay away.  They pay very well, but use that as a means to abuse you.  16-18 hours a day, not comp time for holidays,  and you are treated as a number.  Very unprofessional and retaliatory environment."
bad,Needs new management within warehouse and transportation office. Good company but poor management. Poor management is making the place unorganized.
bad,Unfi took a bunch of people with warehouse experience let them go amd put people with brand new ideas on how to run a company and nothing gets done the way it should they promise all sorts of extra benefits and pay amd doesn't deliver
bad,"UNFI bought out my previous employer, then proceeded to build a new warehouse and laid off 250 employees without honoring their union contract to follow their work. Did not offer any employee a job at the new warehouse. They also agreed to abide by the decision of a Arbitrator, but once the Arbitrator ruled in favor of the employees/Union, the company decided to fight in court.  This company does not abide by their Union contracts."
bad,Management was horrible. The GM started working at the new warehouse before it was done and for the last 6 months he turned his back on us and never looked back.
bad,"If upper management cared just a little about there employees like they use too,the job would be decent again. But as of now don't waste your time,the job isn't worth the headache."
bad,You have to be faster than the illegal immigrants that they hire and they do know they're illegal immigrants as long as they have paperwork they'll hire them they don't care all they're worried about is their numbers they don't concern about you you're not concerned about anything but their numbers if you don't get their numbers you don't get a job they don't care about work safety they don't care about anything it's sad
bad,As long as you are kissing up to management they love you as soon as you want a vacation or day off they mess with your hours they don’t care about you only what you can do for them
bad,Their turn over rate is really high. They fire people daily. The supervisors are pointless they do not listen to your complaints or if you need something new.
bad,Management turnover is very high. Upper management does not care about operations staff. They are very pig headed and power hungry. Lack of planning and support staff. Stay away.
bad,"Not a job for everyone. Hours are long, you are on your feet lifting and bending for 10 hours plus each work day. You have to work hard and fast or you are booted out the door."
bad,"Hard Work... batched pallets,  inconsistency , Long Hours"
bad,"They work you like a dog and could care less if you get to see your family or not. They have the supervisors work 12 to 16 hours a day, but the Managers work 7 or 8.  It was a miracle if the GM was even there 4 days in a week."
bad,"Pay and Benefits are good. Management and Processes are terrible!!! I have several years of experience in the Industry with some of the largest companies  in this business and this company is horrendous! No training, No Support, A Director that has no business sitting in her office. Treat Buyers like garbage, and show no appreciation for the long hours and hard work employees put in"
bad,At first its is an ok jobs until you start to realize that your mangement is taking advantage of you as a worker. Also it seems that instead of helping workers become better and fix problems mangement throws you under the bus and then helps out one of there friend
bad,"not up to date. high turnover rate with management. dont have basic supplies needed to do my job."
bad,"Typical day at work was working so hard so fast that when the day was done, I realized I had not eaten lunch. (Almost Everyday)"
bad,"It was a great job at first,but then it got worse. They have no respect for employee's personal life there is no balance between work and home life. You are expected to come in even if there is bad weather a blizzard or any such thing. No communication between management and no respect to individuals. overtime is expected even if you have plans and were told at last minute. Point system is the worst."
bad,Horrible hours. Mediocre pay. Management doesn't care at all. No pension. Dirty warehouse. No normal schedule. Super physical labor. Don't let their employees have a normal work/life balance.
bad,"It's okay if youre really hurting for a job. And the benefits are fairly priced. Hr lied on orientation, saying you get $1 raise for every year but it's actually 75c then after that $1. They have poor managment on second shift. The manager is very negative and talks down to his employees and makes racist remarks towards great workers. They have 5 supervisors and none of them talk to each other or they'll lie and manipulate good workers into working harder with no recognition. They're constintanly moving people around trying to fill holes from people quitting. You're supposed to get an extra $2 more for working in the freezer but they'll ""forget"" to add it to your pay. "
bad,I regret accepting the position. I hated my job. Management is horrendous. They say they will help you get promoted when they hire you. Don't believe it. They get offended when you try to leave and better yourself. If you do get promoted you hear a lot of nasty rumors that originate from your previous supervisors. They are very unprofessional.
bad,The benefit package was good. The only downfall to working at UNFI is there point system. If you were late because of a snow storm or stuck in traffic you would receive a point. After 10 points you would be fired
bad,"The turnover rate with UNFI is very high. Management is always changing things because of their lack of knowledge instead of just talking to the associates. Schedule changes are the norm around here, associates are never the priority."
bad,"Chronic delivery issues, shortage, and miss-picks. Time allowed at each store was not enough to do the job correctly. Support from management was questionable at times. I felt like I as viewed as a complainer but issues where never getting resolved."
bad,This place is very competitive as in you have to compete for your job everyday you work long hours everyday and if you don't keep a quota you will be let go
bad,"The new Gm has changed everything! We no longer work long hrs..at all! We barely get 8 hrs & yet we’re still only scheduled to wrk 4 days a week. Coming in to get overtime is suddenly a problem when we’re barely getting 35 hrs a week let alone 40. Management sucks but the supervisors are alright. Weekly pay, start at 14.25, full benefits,Start time 10am, no advancements, no opportunity for growth, A LOT of favoritism but if u brown nose you’ll be fine lol. Just a job. Regular warehouse issues really"
bad,The management team I worked with was very green. There was no leadership. You did not get the necessary support or feedback from management. One manager tried to provoke an argument with me. This person was a very poor manager.
bad,"I think if I was on any other team at UNFI, I would have had success.  I explicitly expressed the desire to have training upon being hired, and was not provided any; however, I was expected to perform job duties to a standard I didn't fully understand/was never taught.  I was not set up for success at all and felt that I was always trying to catch up from behind rather than excelling at all."
bad,"Management is absolutely terrible, very hot in my area of the warehouse.i can't complain about the pay. Mandatory extra days are terrible, they say its temporary, but I have been doing it for over a year."
bad,Long hours going in early in the morning not sure of what time you are off and huge orders of organic food that you must select to be shipped you spend alot of time away from your family
bad,Summary says it all! They work you like a slave and even told me that my wife had to wait in the hospital cafeteria until the end of my shift and she had just had our BABY!
bad,"My suggestion is if you need money and have no need of a life outside of work, this is the place for you. We work until the job is done which should range anywhere from 11 hours a day to 16+ hours a day. however when things get bad, the get horrible. 4 day work weeks at 50+ hours at the end. and occasionally they make it mandatory to work days off. People quit or get fired and the days get worse from there, as of the time of writing this we start at 11a.m and will be lucky to leave by 3a.m"
bad,Good company to start out with. Easy to get into due to noncompetitive pay and high turnover at the company. Take on roles beyond the job description due to people quitting. However very many dissatisfied clients due to disorganised management.
bad,Even in the office area their is a warehouse mentality watch over the shoulder type atmosphere some awesome co workers but for the most part company is behind the times.
bad,"My worst work experience."
bad,"Local management was great. Corporate culture, not so great. The landscape has definately changed, and not for the better. Good ride for ten years, but time for a change. I will miss the few I have worked with for the past ten years, won't miss the strikes (2) and the newer Risk Management/Safety regime. I was all about people, they are all about cost. Mores the pity."
bad,Management changes all the time. Poor communications between different departments and regions. No growth opportunities. Long Hours. Friendly and diverse staff.
bad,"Badly managed. Militant. Dirty. People are clique, no advancement, raises reduced from 3 to 2.5.  no incentive. Hard to take time off.  Pay is ok. Benefits are good"
bad,Too many changes in HR and management and the overtime is nice but ridiculous sometimes. A decent temporary job but not long term. They would single people out and QA their orders constantly if you were any type of problem and some of the people from Ghana would give you mispicks to make you lose your incentive so you would slow down and create more overtime. Racial issues were constant there because of this which was a shame.
bad,"there is no life/work balance you spend more time at work than you for at home, the supervisors are pathetic, they don't have a clue to what's going on.."
bad,"I worked at this exact location in West Sacramento. Pay is just okay! "
bad,Day starts off with a pre-shift meeting then it's on to your pallet jack to pick orders. Orders usually range from 800 pounds to nearly 2000 pounds. You will have to pick orders this size up to 20-30 times a shift. Your shift typically lasts 12-14 hours depending on how short staffed you are that night. Management only cares about meeting numbers. I rarely saw a member of management help pick any orders on nights they knew we'd be there til 3 or 4 in the morning. Once your shift finally ends you go home and turn around to do it all over again. My body has never hurt so bad from a job until I worked at UNFI. The turn over rate is also very alarming due the reasons stated above. They also go through a temp company to fill positions. That is a red flag.
bad,"Please consider if this is what you want to do because you will be lifting all day heavy cases of water to boxes of chips. Very repetitive job and there rate system will get on your nerves eventually. I never know when I'll leave work, you work until the work is completed. They don't want to hire people to other positions like a 'replenishment driver because they need selectors so bad your just another number."
bad,"Pays well enough, but you will work hard, long days, constant worrying about job security, and you never know when you're done for the day so very hard to have a life after work."
bad,"I was at a job fair and was offered a job, if passed the usual background checks. I was not told that this was a cold storage facility also. I did not want to work in a cold storage environment. Being told that you have to stay until done, when you have schedule shift. Otherwise do not put stop time for a shift. Equipment that is out dated or lack of preventative maintenance for the equipment. "
bad,The workplace always has new hires present replacing others no longer with the company.
bad,longs hours. no life always working overtime. no management control
bad,"I was excited about working for this company. During orientation they sell you on the dream of what can be, but all of that goes away once you are actually on the floor. I was hired as a forklift operator, the pressure to get the job done was very high almost to the point that it felt unsafe to work at the pace expected. The training was very little to none, especially in the area where I was working. I had several years management experience under my belt and was interviewed for a supervisory position. I was never notified if I received the position or not, they just brought in people from the outside to fill those positions. Very unprofessional,with no room to grow. In my tenure there I didn't speak to anyone who had move up in the company, some could not get promoted from within for being ""friendly"" with the other employees, but most had no desire to move up for fear of losing their job after the promotion. Apparently this is what happens to people who move up to the next level, the next option is the door. Management had no concerns with helping new employees learn the job. I asked a questions and the answer i got was a shrug of the shoulders and ""what do you want me to do, go figure it out..."". I was praised for my performance on occasion, but my 90 day evaluation never came. And my position was a good one. I feel bad for the order selectors and what they go through, but that is a story for another day. This place SUCKS! Don't believe the hype."
bad,Management doesn't care about anything you're just a number. They have good benefits they pay you very well you have PTO. There's a lot of people that get special treatments by management and HR. they will fire you in a heartbeat and take your insurance away after you already paid for it the week  before.
bad,"After working with unfi for several months I saw a steady decline in appreciation and consideration for the employees. It became a numbers game real quick. Which is interesting because UNFI stocks are dropping fast."
bad,You and your work is not valued at all. You are at the mercy of the accounts you handle with no support from higher ups. The pay and the benefits are not to bad.
bad,"Work here in Chesterfield is very tough due to the mismanagement and micromanaging that is constantly going on with your lower, mid and upper levels of supervision.  It used to be a great place to work when they cared about the employees and the customers. Now? Not so much. It’s take, take, take. One of these days either the union will come in or management will go, not sure which happens first. I would advise you to stay far away unless you enjoy getting abused. I’m here because of my age and my seniority status. The latter is becoming a moot point slowly. We have not gotten a raise in over 8 years. Not even a cost of living. Nice huh?  Quite sad..."
bad,They recently acquired another large company and are in a transition phase.  Current downsizing is happening nationwide as well as divestiture of assets.
bad,Hard long hours where you must meet a requirement of production which is sometimes unattainable. If you have a family that you would like to see this is not the job for you.Managment is overall decent would be a better place if you had two days off in a row. Some good things are the money is good and you can advance if you do your job good.
bad,"I worked with Gourmet Guru when they were purchased by UNFI. I was optimistic of the future with them since I have always worked with large companies prior to Gourmet Guru. We were a small company of 80 people. Systematically, UNFI has laid off all but 4 of the former Gourmet Guru employees. Some of those have been some of the best sales people I have ever met. Furthermore, UNFI is so compartmentalized that you will never interact or meet people who work with you unless you stumble into them somewhere by chance."
bad,Lacks consistency with policies.  Only certain staff meet 3x week behind closed doors; NO communication to remaining staff.  Vague diversity with employees.
bad,If you don't mind having any time for yourself or family then this job is great for you. 70+ hours working a week. It was to much for me I could not balance my work life with my family life
bad,"nice company to work for if you single with no kids. Its a lot of long hours, 12 to 16 plus hr nights. I feel like its poorly managed. It has a very high turnover rate."
bad,You need to make sure you hit your UPH or you will be looking for a new job soon. They would have you hit a ridiculous amount of cases per hour and having to be short staffed didn't help with the amount of hours we would have to do and have to keep up with the pace like a robot. Some day you would work 10 hrs but most days they are working 14hrs. The room for growth is good but that just because they seem not able to keep anyone in key positions
bad,See above.  Not much fun to work there.  Very long hours and no support from upper management. Always shooting from the hip.  No plan or structure of doing things.
bad,"Company has good pay and benefits.  Most fellow employees are really cool. Management sucks. This company does not appreciate anybody nor do they care about you. Its only about UNFI, not happy employees.  No work/life balance.  Write ups for EVERYTHING!"
bad,If you are applying to this job PLEASE do not expect advancement and an extensive social lifestyle. Hours are long especially when the workload is heavy. Management could careless of how hard you work each day.   This job is strictly for a paycheck.  Just a stepping stone to something better.
bad,management was not very helpful because they did not know much about the job to be done. Co-workers were not trained rite as how to do the job rite.  Keeping up with numbers.
bad,"system they work is old, you place labels on the product which you are picking and you continue this throughtout the wharehouse untill your order is done. you wouldnt know what time you would get off cause so many people call off its funny, everyone has different days off ,except for saturday they said they were for the workers and if we have a problem tell them, but they never do anything"
bad,"With the high rate of turn over in the management department, UNFI Auburn suffers from the lack of sustainability in processes and throughput drivers. The Union environment makes it very challenging to effect improvements and hold a associates accountable for their performance or lack there of. The overall operation shift personnel were fun and enjoyable and UNFI is a great family centric company."
bad,"This place is full of idiots, and they're operating pallet jacks and reach lifts. TWO people knocked their reach lift over in my first 90 days. "
bad,"The people are very immature. It's like high school all over again. the people are very competitive. If you dont wanna work this is not the job for u."
bad,always ready to fire the topped out pay employees the harder you work the more work they give you to make up the slack of the other workers good pay and benefits but that's about it a lot of wear and tear on your body
bad,"I worked at the SUPERVALU division of UNFI.  SUPERVALU's business is challenged, daily, by independent grocer contraction due to competition in their marketplace and a very competitive marketplace of Wholesalers."
bad,U dont have route when  u start u can work day or night layovers shuttle work in the yard  Start pay 23.50 top pay 31 is union shop bad thing don’t have union  pension turnover is super high a lot paperwork u can do something wrong they can fired u for anything is one guy and one lady in transportation department be carefull is one anti union company .
bad,Very stressful and poor management teams. Extremely hard to advance unless you have a friendship with someone in management. Needs serious process improvement.
bad,"-pay was good!!"
bad,"Not a bad entry level job, but poor inexperience managers makes the job not enjoyable. Also this is not a secure job due to contractual bid or contracts."
bad,the work is easy. Low level pay. too authoritarian. Not a bad place to start out working or your career. I wouldn't stay here long though. This company has low profit margins.
bad,"this job is fast paced and the manger expect you to do your job. there is favoritism and judgement. if you hang out with one ""bad seed"" they consider you are the same type of person."
bad,"The culture is different for every department. "
bad,management was more concerned about numbers than employees welfare. Stressful environment with video monitoring happening. Direct manager was helpful but anyone above her was clueless.
bad,"You either work 1st shift (2am-4am start time) for receiving, or 2nd shift (usually starts around 11:30am) for pickers. "
bad,"This company has a great new hire orientation. It seems like a great job at first but you will see after a while this company takes one step forward and two back.For example one grocery product pallet would have 2-3 stops on it. Same with dairy pallets. They eliminated multi stops on grocery (one step forward) but then put the entire trucks stops dairy on one pallet and same for frozen (two backwards). Sometimes you'd have 175-225 pcs of dairy on one pallet with 10 stops and you have to break the entire pallet down to get 8pcs for first stop on bottom. Lets say you have 9 stops in Brooklyn, maybe you drop off at 1or2 stops the rest is going to be hand truck in.The stops will be all over the place too. You could go from Brighton Beach to Williamsburg to Park Slope. Runs are bid on by seniority. The people they hire to work in transportation office have 0% experience in trans and logistics and the chaos of the work day shows that.They are just learning as they go. If you get done early then they'll send you to go help another driver. Most of the customers are great and they will tell you this used to be a good company but has gotten to big to fast. There is to many moving parts and not enough experience in industry for trans and warehouse to work together. Pay is good but you will earn it and have no time to enjoy it. Barely enough time to get home and eat and relax a minute before sleep to be in 10hrs later. Best to work overnite here alot less headaches or go with Penske directly across the steet."
bad,"Most of Service Desk is made up of contractors who have zero benefits and whose ideas and complaints are not taken validly."
bad,Rough place to work for any level of management. No Teamwork makes for angry staff.
bad,"I worked at UNFI up until I realized they were trying to bust their union following a recent employee strike. I have since moved on. Word on the street is that the management is poor and the company is unlikely to exist at all in 5 years. Work here was pretty grueling. Shifts could go up to 10 or 11 hours at a time. Every second of your productivity was tracked, and you could be punished for not picking fast enough"
bad,I worked 3rds as a reciever. You work until the job is done. With my job we had to be out of the way before the pickers and next shift came in so we didnt get the bad end of the deal when it came to long hours. The warehouse was cold. Colder than any warehouse I have worked in. The day shift people sometimes where there for 20 hours a day. The benefits were decent and decent priced
bad,I cannot really rate this company that high because in the 11 years i have worked here it has sold 3 times and becoming UNFI was the worst. I am not sure at this point if I will have a job.  They are moving the warehouse to Centralia be the end of the year and my job has not been posted yet.  When the company was Supervalu I got laid off but accepted the position i am in now.  It has been a very stressful and horrible experience.
bad,"if you need a job, this is a great place to work their is opportunity in different departments and believe me when I say they will take care of you, but do not become a supervisor. They will take advantage of you, they will tell you that you are not a good supervisor if you do not work more the 10 hours a day when you are scheduled for 8 and unless you start off as a supervisor they will under pay you if your one of the few and work your way up. I was not the only supervisor that they underpaid and took advantage of. You will see that with overtime the hourly associates will make more than you, and believe me there is a ton of overtime."
bad,"On the task I am doing now I pretty much follow the same routine every day I write the load diagrams for the trucks and we always have the same runs every day. On the first position I had I was in charge of processing damages and  returns and also writing the diagrams. That, I enjoyed more cause I had the opportunity to move around the warehouse and learn from different areas. The work culture is poor with too many irresponsible  people and no corrective actions toward them that makes it discouraging."
bad,"While my immediate manager was great and the CSO who left was great, the way in which managers and others were treated by the senior management was at best inconsiderate and more aptly described as unfair and personally motivated.  While I actually benefited from a couple of the demotions and removals, I did not want either to be unfairly next."
bad,"1 Month of craziness. There isn't a training program and the main system is 30 years old. Constant computer issues and even though it has the feel of a call center environment its not. The main function are their transportation routes but scream to get calls when they back up on hold. (madness) "
bad,Great group of Fllor associates as well as Middle Management
bad,"This is a very demanding job, normal work hours are 70 hours per week"
bad,"The morale was terrible at this company.  Multiple people around me were fired for minor errors, often not even their fault.  You're considered ""on call"" on your days off, whether you want to be or not, no matter what you have going on.  The managers were verbally abusive.  Employees have to provide proof of everything.  If it's election day, you'd better hope your polling place is one of the few that gives you an ""I Voted"" sticker, or they won't believe you.  If you're sick, you're expected to have a doctor's note, even though most people don't go to the doctor every single time they're ill, because it's a waste of money.  Someone I worked with was forced to go to the ER one day when she was sick, or face being written up.  "
bad,"Mixed feelings about working here. I thought the warehouse was amazingly set up and it made it very easy to get your work done. We had brand new machines. Our guns we used for order picking and replenishing always worked well. And it was very organized. However, the hours and overtime were very exhausting. We only had 1, 30 min break. In a 10/11 hour shift. Unless you were a smoker. Management would play favorites with the work given, because depending how fast you go you get extra pay. It's physically  demanding work."
bad,buen ambinte de trabajo y buen sueldo pero con pesimo trato a los empleados
bad,The jobs good but the company doesn’t care and is anti union or our union is fighting for us. We are teamsters 117 and I was emoloyeed by supervalu until UNFI bought them out.
bad,Worked for a couple years for this company. Management tells you that they will fix issues and that they care for your valuable feedback. Then they turn around and make fun of you behind your back. Not very professional. Management will not change anything unless it benefits them. Pay is great but the stress is overwhelming.
bad,"I worked as a delivery driver for years there, had bid routes. Was ok place back years ago. Thing's have changed though. Was a yard jockey and city driver. Pay was good."
bad,This place is actually decent when it comes to pay and the atmosphere is great. The only problem is that its rules are far too strict in the first 90 days. Its extremely easy to work very very hard and still get fired for being sick one day. Be Warned!
bad,"I was employed there for 3 months, my pregnant girlfriend got heart failure after a car accident and had flight for life to Milwaukee. I missed a few days when they were gonna do a procedure on her but would drive to work from Milwaukee and drive back down every other day. I was let go because they said it seemed like I didn’t even wanna work there. My girl was pregnant and was in the ICU and HR even said they would not give me points given the circumstances. Never know what time you’ll get out. Could be 3:30 or 7:30."
bad,"They make it seem like your going to work 11-9:30 which isn’t bad if that was the case.. it was supposed to be 4 days a week but they will make you work 5 and they don’t let you leave until the job is done. You could  enter at 11am and leave at 4am and still expected to be back to work the next morning and possiblly  go until 2am, you just never know.  They stay later than usual almost EVERYDAY. You get screwed over because other people call out. Don’t recommend working here unless you don’t have a life."
bad,"Overall lack of clear processes and agreements about how UNFI and its customers are going to do business. Chaos ensues.There was a lot of running-faster-on-the-hamster-wheel rather than progress being made, which ended up being an exercise in chronic frustration."
bad,"The best part of the job was working with all the nice people all over the country. The stores, vendors, brokers, sales team and fellow employees in all different departments."
bad,"Not organized or ready for customer orders."
bad,"Over all pretty good place to work . Fast pace fun at times very strick management, Fun coworks.Hardest part of the job is working really long  hours"
bad,This company does not care if you’re walking limping or hurt they will fire you and let you go for that reason because they do not care about your well-being they will work you to death and then turn around and try to work you into the work is done and it does not matter how long it takes you can take a whole day.Oh yeah if you try to tell  this company that you have situations that you are  going through they don’t care they cut they  Cut their losses and go on about their business
bad,Great place to work if you don’t have a life or have a family to go home to.  Very long hours when I say long I don’t mean 12 hour days I’m talking about 16.  Work is very repetitive.  Repeating the same process over and over.  I don’t recommend working here.  Save your joints and back for another job.
bad,"UNFI is a easy and great company, but the long hours can be overwhelming, you never know when you are getting off.  Sometimes you can work 15 hours in 1 day. The longest I worked was 20 hours in 2012 due to a lot of call ins. You don't have a set time when you can go home like a regular 8 to 5 Job, you go home when the job is complete, which can be hard because I have a daughter that I barely see because of the long hours and by the time I finally make it home she usually is sleep, also very hard trying to go to school and work at the same time because you be so tired and have to get up and do it all over again, which makes the process of school a longer progress that could have been completed earlier. That is the hardest part for me is being away from my daughter for so long. I literally be at work more than home."
bad,"I was one of the first employees hired into UNFI so I was pretty high up on the seniority list making top pay.  However the hours demanded of the workers were far to extreme. During the xmas holiday we had days we started at 9:30 in the morning and left at 4:00 am the following morning then expected back by 9:30 that day to work yet another 14 hour day.  In my personal opinion fork lift operators should not be allowed to work more than 12 hours a day and should be allowed a minimum of 10 hours between shifts."
good,"16 hour work days working salary. You feel like your getting paid minimum wage for the money you get in your pay check. No work life balance what so ever  "
good,When I was there the supervisor had expectations but they espect their expectations meet asap. And a lot of favoritism by the supervisor toward a specific group of ppl.
good,they do not care about thier employees only how much product is going out
good,The company tripled in size in the last year and there is a lot of confusion.  The systems are being merged and its been difficult to grasp everything.
good,Not a place i recommend working due to the executive team's expectation and compensation.  The salary positions are expected to work until the job is done which will never happen due to the nature of the business so employees work over 50 hours a week.
good,get to work on time 11pm get out of work after loading trucks all night at 5am the next day
good,"I was second shift , I was a really fast picker, the company wanted everyone to meet our numbers at 95% which was hard for a lot of people , If people did not meet their numbers they would get a write up, which wasn't that fair because their was complications on the job, like spills not getting picked up , tight spaces , people got crowded. it was mostly stressful."
good,"You will work every Sunday as it is mandatory with Saturday off and one week day. You are a 50 hour employee so 10 hours of overtime is built into your schedule. During busy season you will work well over 10 hours a day. There is a high employee turnover so you will see new faces often. The material handling equipment is old and limited. Get to work EARLY of you want a good lift or pallet jack. Making your Production percentage will be your biggest stress. Breaks are every 2.5 hours from clock-in and lunch at 4.5 but breaks arent mandatory. With the work load and production don't expect to take ALL of your daily breaks. At the end of the day, it is a warehouse and that comes witg typical warehouse Drama, that said you get paid every week and with overtime you will make almost a $1K a week before taxes."
good,"UNFI has some really great people to work with.  Although, their culture leaves much to be desired.  Many employees feel underpaid & underappreciated.  Employees are constantly required to give more and more while the company does nothing to provide you with the tools that you need to be successful.  For example: Old computers that are very slow and an accounting system that is extremely outdated."
good,"The company operations are still trying to catch up to their competitors (Sysco, Unified, DPI) in regards to operating systems and their overall business plan.  "
good,"Lots of change and management has no direction or vision. Future financial security and job security is in question. If you okay with constant change and do not expect a work like balance, then this is the place for you."
good,I was working 2nd shift going in at 1030 AM I learned how to pull orders and replenish with a reach forklift most of the management team weren't that good they were never on the same page that was the hardest thing about working there but the associates are good people that was the best part of working there
good,"I had a two-day orientation process after my initial hiring date (free deli sandwiches one day, pizza the second for lunches ), along with four other new hires.  We were sold on the company history, values and all things that made it a positive experience to work there, including the ""promotion from within"" business model. We even heard from veteran employees and their personal positive experiences with UNFI. The counselors told us all about how team-oriented the culture is and how green the company was ( offering a monetary incentive if you purchased an electric or hybrid vehicle ) and a 20k lifetime tuition on your education.  Who could say no to that? "
good,"You never know what time you are getting off, and the employees are not made to stay to ensure that everybody get off at a descent hour.  The hours of work is unknown daily."
good,supervisors don't communicate between each other making employees do superfluous tasks. Disconnect between culture of hourly associates and salaried leadership team. Not much respect given to supervisors. Pay is decent but not what i would call a one person salary to provide for a family would require 2 income to support a family. Benefits are good as far as medical and vision. 401K is decent not great.
good,"The pay is great but its not worth the struggle of being yelled at all day and never being able to go home."
good,"Most people appear to stay in UNFI's IT department because of the inconvenience of finding and starting a new job. Some good managers, but  insecure micro-management is the norm and tends to win out. This starts at top. You must be willing to endure a lot of corporate cheerleading. Upper management employees get frequent title changes and promotions. Below director, promotions and raises beyond cost of living are very rare."
good,UNFI had good people to work with and management was not all bad. It was fun in the beginning and work life balance was not bad. But 14 plus hours working a day for 6 days caused a lot of turnover.
good,use to be a good company to work for.  now there slowly taking away your benefits. and they promote the people that do the least work. most of the supervisors are related
good,"A typical day for me would start out with me making boxes for the orders that i would be picking for the day. i would walk around the warehouse getting the product i needed for the daily shipment, when finished picking the order i would then stage it in designated are for shipment."
good,Long hours but will be worth the pay. Benefits are expensive i pay 400 a month. Overall its ok for lazy ppl that wanna work this aint the job for you..
good,"The schedule that was advertised on their add was not the actual one  I worked the picked it for me. The have a high turn over rate. There were times I would get off at 12 or 1 in the morning. It's a VERY physical job. You have a percentage to maintain which is based on how fast you can complete your order and not by the pieces you pick. It was very frustrating at times. Was very cold at times, didn't provide work gloves."
good,"The work load keeps growing making it difficult for many of the employees to complete what was expected in a typical work day, therefore many of us were expected to stay hours after our normal work shift. There was also no way to move up, and after 5 years I needed to move on."
good,"Is a great company to work for, but has poor management and no structure benefits and pay are  excellent. Has a high turn over rate due to tardies and not coming to work. Physical work 4days of work! Will be at work more than home. Hr has gotten better within a few weeks!"
good,"When I first started here as a Temp, I absolutely loved it! I didn't start disliking it until, we heard that the company was moving the whole second floor to the east coast. Toward the end of the transition it was obvious that the management had their favorites. So those temps got into permanent positions, while the not so favorite temps were let go. Regardless of if they had more experience and better attendance. Which is a JOKE! I'm honestly glad the supervisors and managers didn't push for me to get hired on, like they did for others, because I would rather not work for a company that has those type of values! They have a very cooperate mentality, which is sad. The employees felt it and so did the customers!"
good,"This company has gone through several supervisors and department managers is the past few years. Why is there such a high turnover?"
good,"The money was not bad but the hours were terrible. Even if you were not scheduled to work Sundays, oftentimes you were forced to do so. Advancement was a near impossibility."
good,"work from midnight to when work is complete"
good,Management really did not take time to develop their teams. It seems they cared more about the business than the employees. Really no room for advancement on all levels.
good,Some employees are kept despite their glaring incompetence. Week management. Union seniorities are complicated and absurd. Warehouse is falling apart.
good,The hardest part about this job is the hours. Working over 60 hour weeks most of year and 70 plus hour weeks during the busy season that sometimes last for months.
good,"I enjoyed working here, the set schedule was perfect because there were no weekends. I have to say that there is no leniency with regard to your personal life however, so that can be difficult if you are a single parent."
good,"I have nothing to review and refuse to submit a review at this time. You have answers to your questions, use them at your discretion. No other information available"
good,"If your a long term associate the pay scale becomes favorable and there is plenty of overtime, but you are literally worked to the bone. Apply for a management positon at your own risk. The management turnover rate is absolutly ridiculous. One year wew litterally went through three GM's. If you make one mis-step as a mananger your probably fired. This philosophy does not allow for any kind of stability in culture and team buiding. Work life balance does not exist here if you are a warehouse associate. You never know when youre work shift ends since its dictated by how much work we have for the day, which is usually a minimum of 10 hours. This doesnt allow for any kind of planning or consistant family time schedule. Overall though, the money pretty decent and competative to the other similar warehouses in the area, but the trade off is no social or family life."
good,"Long hours, 12 to 18 hr nights, on production keeping your production at a certain percentage for the night. Cleaning up spills, & pulling orders while you working in replenishing shelves."
good,On average during a week you could get up to 70 Hours and the minimum is 50.  It's a good place to work but if you want to spend time with your family or have a social life don't work there.
good,Fun place to work but the way management runs is not good for the employee.No job security too many threats as far as productivity and what not.If people don't take care of themselves there they can get hurt easily.
good,"Starting off was great. I mean really great. I really enjoyed this job until late. "
good,overall  ten good company too much travel! its started out good but became to much travel! The pay started as salary plus commission and then became only commission!
good,"I gave UNFI 7 years of my life and over that time I witnessed a family oriented company turn into a corporate monster. I am kind of happy they laid me off. Money was more important than their associates."
good,My experience with UNFI was a good working experience. The over all management was good at compensating for needs or working with you for requests off. The down fall of management was that they were very unorganized policy's and procedures would change but management wouldn't have much detail or knowledge of the changes and how they would go about our daily performance. Overall the job was a good experience and helped build my excel skills.
good,Was good but getting worse each year and taking away some benefits yearly.
good,hours very uncertain and not fair work. Need to be in a decent physical condition. High turn around rate.
good,Acquisition by UNFI to buy SUPERVALU  has been ongoing with many hurdles and many unknowns at this time.  Confidence in leadership team is low and difficult to know where company is headed long term.
good,"it wasnt that hard , the management need more training but i enjoy it for the most part ,i learn to drive the pallet jack and forklift  "
good,"They're unfair and do not keep you updated, they moved from Auburn to Centralia but did not keep us in the loop we were lied to and management left while we waited for the move"
good,"The job itself is very easy to learn, long as you listen and study the job the way you were trained. Me myself have learned a lot by working there and started from the bottom working myself up to where I am now."
good,It is very stressful right now with the acquisition of Supervalu.  There have been many layoffs and it feels like there is more to come.  The job is ok but there is not much room for advancement.
good,"Constantly actively moving around, you have to know what you're doing and stay focused, the number one thing they stress on is safety. There's a lot of machinery you have to be consciously aware about"
good,Employees work a lot of OT my highest two week pay period was 133 hours. There is very little room for work life balance. There is no 401k just a $0.40 per hour worked pension plan. Overall it’s hard work and it takes a special person to get through it everyday.
good,Too much work without consecutive days.. Its has a bad timing for the production system they always are on your back about production but it is almost impossible to meet
good,It is a good place to work when they have hours except for the wearhouse mistakes that the driver gets in trouble for or the fact that they will cut your hours then spend a month telling you you just have to wait till they get them
good,UNFI is a great company in a sense.  They know what they want to do and are willing to get it done. They also have some awesome supervisory leadership that takes care of their staff when they can.  The major flaw though is they take on too much work and the ones that slack off are never reprimanded for it and cause others to have to pick up their slack greatly.
good,Not willing to write I would rather not say as I was brought up to not say anything if you didn't have anything good to say at all.  Many things will open your eyes working here.
good,The company is constantly changing their employees positions and hours. Which makes it impossible to balance work and personal life. The benefits are good overall.
good,"If your looking for a job that gives you lots of hours then Unfi is the job for you. Its fast pace job, you have opportunity to grow. First shifts starts a 2am. Second shift 10am."
good,UNFI is a great place to work if you have a cushy office job with straight days. Second shift is awful. Very long hours with very labor intensive work.
good,Planning a roster of head count in each department to better plan how many hours in a day by the number of customers sales. Moving associates around to better each department for the amount of work to better service our customers.
good,i was a selector and it was long hours and pretty much a workout from when you started to when you finished. very hard work but i enjoyed it while it lasted
good,"Longest hours you will ever work, solid 11 hour days of straight work. If you are not afraid of hard work and love to use machines then this is the place for you."
good,"working long hours every day like you are not going back the next day.. i am tired of the long hours and pay is not pleasing, no sick time just PTO hours"
good,Personally unfi's montgomery site still has a lot of improving to do its a new warehouse with that being said its still going through the start up stages a lot a people in and out in my 2 years working for the company I've seen a lot of people come and go
good,"Read emails to ensure that we are on schedule with customer request. Coordinate with customer service to see what special documentation I might need for a particular shipment"
good,not much of a work life balance. lots of hours.  pay use to be good.  company slow going down hill in my eyes.  should really start listening to the employees and their complaints.
good,"The day would start at noon with all employees clocking in, then we would have a start up meeting and stretches before starting the work day. All employees are easy to get along with and the employees made the job fun and exciting to go too. Some managers were easy to go up too and talk and some weren't. When I got hired in 2013 of November the hours were very long with no time to sleep or have a life and that was very taxing on the body."
good,"The job pays well, it has good benefits.  It is a job that the employees work until the work is done.  Difficult to get approved days off, Seniority has the right away for requests. High Pick rate with little to none down time approval.  Supervisors need to work more on their teamwork, that is the team of supervisors, communication and being on the same note and standards is not at proper professional level.  Coworkers like to talk and be friendly with each other.  "
good,Would b a nice company 2 work 4 if they would get new management
good,"Christmas bonus, Free food for the holidays, fsst pace working condition Drove double pallet jack and forklift"
good,"People are nice and the company pays good, it still a great place for people to work. They always welcoming people there so I will advice people to work there"
good,"Associates need to be appriceated more, high turn over rate. Favoritism when it comes to promotions.work life balance is promised but management doesn't deliver."
good,Unfi could do better at treating its employees betters. They can also have better management that will be willing to listen to problem instead of ignoring them
good,started as selector got promoted within.worked my butt off.hard work does get you somewhere.opportunities to travel alot to other DC'S. incentive program gets you paid fast
good,"Working at the company for multiple years, they have to see you're on your way out before you get real recognition and offers of advancement."
good,"Good company to work for, good work life balance, good pay, they provided the most up to date tools to do the job, work environment was good, good benefits."
good,"think about the production of the day to think about stretching exercises then I took it as an exercise on a daily basis so the day ended shorter and happier with the team workers and the environment, the staff was treatable the only bad thing about the work are the hours worked."
good,"not enough time to breathe due to management. Cared for bigger customers than smaller customers who helped start the customer."
good,Had to cover sales rep route.  Did not know where I would go until you got a call in the morning.  Sometimes I had to travel very far.  I had to pack out product from a pallet.  Management tracks the time it takes to finish work.  Trainer was very experienced.  Job was very stressful.  Had to be efficient and fast.  If you are slow they will tell you.  Have to be prompt all the time. Made some good friends.
good,title says it all. great people who work there. management could be better.                                                         its a great paying job.
good,Four day work week with an average of 13-16 hrs per shift or until all shots are done. Very fast paced. Half hour unpaid lunch and 15 minute paid break every 3 hours. Discount on their products with mini store in warehouse for employees.
good,"I originally loved the job, but the corporate powers that be decided that promoting bullies and disregarding attempts to do the right thing were ignored. In a company where people are acknowledged up on a board when they help members of other teams or do something to improve process, they're insulted and bullied until they no longer have a choice than to leave. Unfortunately good people leave this company as they're taken for granted and their voices are ignored in favor of those that talk the loudest."
good,"the pay is more then competitive, but the work load takes up everything not much  of a home life. All the overtime hour will beat your body up. P.P.O takes a long time to accumulate."
good,"Nice coo-workers, lots of overtime. Right now management is making  big changes to the entire warehouse lots of supervisors and warehouse workers leaving because of the changes. but overall good paying job and good work experience."
good,Management is hard to work for. Benefits and employees are great to work with but the hours and stress levels caused by the management is to much if you have a family.
good,Good place to work if you are wanting experience. The pay is good and the management staff work with the employees. Good place to work if you are want
good,"Extremely long hours, very short staffed. Good management team and great team members.Enough equipment for team members to do the job that was needed. Hourly bonuses went a long way but team members should not be held accountable for slipping under quota after 10 hours especially at the 14th hour. Company always ensured team members got brakes in a timely fashion."
good,"I loved the people in the departments we worked close with, there was not a lot of room for advancement from what i saw, they did not do a great job with training the associates with what needed to be done how they would like it."
good,"UNFI is more worry about Employees Performance and not about the employees,a good thing is that you can accumulate up to 120 hours of paid PTO,nice co-workers."
good,The culture is fake. They pretend they are a family friendly company but the truth is they are just another big company that cares most about the bottom line. Compensation is middle of the road. Benefits are pretty good. No room for advancement in many departments. Constant re-orgs.
good,"This company has many benefits and very positive people through out the company."
good,i like working here but the work is hard and they don't pay enough. payroll is almost always wrong and pay rate varies. i do like the fact that they offer direct deposit.
good,"A typical day on the job that I do is. Driving to my first location to help the sales rep get an order put away by loading up carts of product to be put up on the shelves making sure to have each cart loaded with product that is all near each other on the shelves to insure good productivity to work in a quick and efficient manner. "
good,"Solid, very little room for advancement."
good,I am tasked with providing program / project management expertise to drive the execution of business  and technical enterprise-wide initiatives.  The environment is challenging and stimulating as the organization is in a state of evolution in terms of PM accumin.
good,"It was fun to work there, working in freezer was  a little bit difficult but with my co-workers it was getting much easier. "
good,"Initially, my experience working for UNFI was a great one later to find out Management was highly unorganized, nothing was never agreed upon prior to making a change. "
good,"receive all running products many people trying to do their job, abserbando supevisores people to do everything right, and that no accidents happen"
good,N/a I got nothing to say bad  it's has its goods and bad this how I feel and I worked for this company for long time it's hard work long hours so be ready
good,Overall the company is good but needs improvement with management. Turn over is very high. I loved the benefits and pay rate however over time was inevitable and my family time was compromised.
good,"I started at UNFI on day 1 when they built the new warehouse, brand new equipment. I trained people that never drove a reach truck before, I was trained from people that have been with the company for over 15 years, first  business day was chaos, people crashing into rails, spilling product,  working there is very dangerous, management did very little to correct. as months go by I have learned that you don't leave till all the trucks were loaded, 8-14 hour days seemed fine till my girlfriend and I have come unreliable picking up my 5 month old son from daycare, or any plans we have made, so I witness a nasty accident, in isle 86 that when I decided to quit sooner or later I could of been injured"
good,"Things could have been a lot more productive and organized if allowed to do my job without very poor direction from management at that time.  To much  interference , plus poor judgement on how to handle people and their overall production."
good,"The managers couldn't care less about you, HR couldn't care less about you, decent pay but you'll definitely work for it, no personal life is allowed outside of work.  Great place to work if you have no family, kids or no spouse probably work around 60-80 hours a week.  Good benefits though."
good,"long days, work on the weekends. pay checks are good work life balance is not. management is not that great, save all paper work, they will lose it. if need a job recommended, not a career"
good,I enjoyed my time at UNFI until the CIO was replaced in 2011/2012 and massive changes occurred. I hear they are moving to Minnesota and cannot talk to the work environment since I left.
good,Overall good place to for very high in demand job that always looking for experience selectors and Forklift operators. Good environment with good benefits and 4 day work weeks
good,Pretty ok it just depends on what you like pick ans pack and hit goals and ride equipment and move for 12 plus hours i work there it was lots of money but no free time.
good,money is good but when you get the hours the  way they treat their employees is horrible they have a horrible point system their turn over rate is the worst i ever seen literally can get fired for anything.
good,"Low starting pay makes you rely on overtime pay. Unlimited overtime available but no family life due to hours worked. Good management,  good workers. The turnover rate in the warehouse is high."
good,"Good company to work for, very laid back work environment.  Up to date technology.  Co workers and vendors were a pleasure to work with.  The work life balance was very strong aspect of UNFI"
good,It was a fast-paced job and I get the work done before you can go home you have a bunch of selectors driving around you selecting all during the night with headsets on and they play music
good,I liked working for this company because it was a flexible schedule for my personal life. It was very busy work which I also like. My typical day was resetting natural foods sections in Farm Fresh. I always felt sense of satisfaction when I stood back and looked at the new section I reset.
good,"Working there was very stressful. You usually Work 10-12 hrs a day.you do receive benifits after the 3rd month in . You get maditory overtime and usually work 6 days a week, having saterday off."
good,"Learn to operate a few new technologies (headsets,rf scanners, etc) but know that management will put you on chopping block when it comes to your performance. Not gender fluent. No equal opportunities for woman. Segregation between females & males."
good,UNFI is a good company to gain experience in the distribution industry. It is not a good company to grow with. The morale is low and they dont make you feel valued.
good,A typical day at unfi is walk clock in start picking your orders to fullfill the requirements of the day management change often work place was sae and clean hardest part was their was a supervisor every few weeks most enjoyable part was when shift was finally over
good,"come in fight for position meet new expectation daily."
good,It's labor intensive so expect a workout. The management is good. I never had a problem with anyone. Just show up on time and work hard.
good,"The general consensus from employees is overworked and underpaid. It could be a great place to work if they hired more help, but they have high expectations and too much stress on their employees from overbearing work loads. Most people can't handle the stress and end up leaving the company once they find another job. Company displays interest in helping the planet and local communities, yet employees fear they'll get too far behind in workload after participating in philanthropic events. They have the potential to be a great company, but while i've been there it;s only gotten worse. Even holiday bonuses and company events have been withdrawn."
good,"While UNFI is a very large and competitive and very progressive company, career advancement was very challenging to come by."
good,Liked working with the people. Not given enough training to reach their level of competence. Each person seems to have their own way of doing things which makes it hard to learn the job
good,"Start off a day at work by pulling orders to go and select, rap, label, load ,and ship. Fork lift certified on everything but a squeeze truck. Learned how to pay close attention to dental. Also do quality control to make sure product is safe to ship, and do drop downs. I have a cool boss I got to get to know over the years. Love my team and the guys I work with, hard working good people. The hardest thing about my job is it's VERY PHYSICAL and Repetitive. The most thing I like about my job is the team I work with.  Just want better ours and opportunity, A 1st shift position is just what I'm looking for."
good,"If you like to work and make as much money as you can, UNFI is the place to go.  The shifts they work are the only bad thing about it."
good,The job was okay. There was not much to the job. Okay place to work. They have been around for many years.
good,A typical work day was picking or shipping trucks to different companies. The hardest part of the job is working over 20 hours to come back the next day on time
good,"Good environment to work in, very fast paced. A workload can get you all the way through a shift. You just have too stay consistent. There is always work."
good,"Great equipment(tractor, trailers, lift gates), hourly pay needs increase..drive and deliver(dry,cool, and frozen items) in 5 boroughs with electric pallet jack and hand truck, trailer lengths and heights depend on your routes listed precautions..,once empty usually bring a backhaul back to DC, overall ok job"
good,as the company grew it the work got more demanding . They changed the systems and production requirements always upward making it harder for people to meet goals.  changed positions not any better.
good,Goes by favorites no matter how high you are on the seniority list good company good benefits would occasionally do catered lunch for employees on holiday or for just working hard
good,"I was a receiver and  most of the day is spent in a 38 degree environment.  Great experience for anyone looking to be educated in warehouse work.  Forklifting is optional after all product received for the day.  Good team members around you.  Performance is a bit micro-managed and relies on metrics.  Be ready for lots of rules and regulations, which may be necessary due to size of the company. Leadership/management will take time to speak with you with questions/concerns/input,"
good,"Responsible for sourcing and staffing all Finance and special projects for the company through the on-boarding procedures. Special projects included Extensive experience in Recruiting and business development. Consistently exceed sales"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of fulltime hours stocking and driving pallets with two 15 minute breaks and one 30-40 minute lunch break."
good,"I work with a lot of good people and a lot of whiners. Some people (in the warehouse) hate it but still come in every day and never apply for internal positions or try to leave. Some people are real happy with where they are at and their compensation. It’s like most corporations, where if you let the job suck then it’ll suck. If you make the most of it and come into work with a purpose and something to look forward to outside of work then you’ll be good."
good,I worked for UNFI on a temp basis that lasted a few years. I designed a billing and catalog system for them and then the company closed. The staff was friendly and management really wasn't that involved.
good,You have to rush to make your numbers and if others are in your way it would affect your time.  The company is very big on numbers and only good thing is if you  are really fast you can make really good money.
good,"Working at unfi my position is a selector pulling orders has requested by operator. On daily basis I pull orders for example (soaps, snacks, toothbrushes, sponges, and other store products)."
good,"Poorly managed, long hours, poorly staffed. Supervisors are disrespectful and poorly trained. Equipment is scarce. Human resources is very rude and mean"
good,"Typical day was answering customer phone calls and keying in orders in the computer, helping customers resolve problems with orders, or shipping issues"
good,"Cool place,  favoriteism, not for me. Maybe someone else would enjoy not having a life. But I need one.  Enjoy your day I need a few more character s to finish up."
good,"self motivating job "
good,"A typical day at work is usually not typical. You have to go with the expectations that every day can be different. The demands of customer orders, associate call offs, etc."
good,"Good place to work, if you like rows of cubicles.  Fair pay but raises were non-existent.  Large company with hundreds of employees, good work environment."
good,Overall it was a ok place to work tons of things to do everyday great people to work with. The management was good most of the time . the plant manager was great
good,Good company. Great benefits. Must be willing to work long hours. The driver corps is outstanding. Management tries very hard to make it an enjoyable experience to work there. If you work hard you will get ahead.
good,"divers tie, management was fair work was quick fast pace. the most part of this job was meeting new people. and learning how to work fast and drive the fort life"
good,When I started it 24 years ago we had aluminum ramps and hand trucks now we have lift gates electric jacks for a job is definitely a lot better than it was 24 years ago. We still go to New York City lot of people don't like to go to New York City and we also go to Boston which sometimes not that fun neither so if you want to come work for UNFI expect to do City runs and New York and Boston and hand truck deliveries throughout all of 95 through Connecticut . Plan on starting between 12 a.m. and 5 a.m. Monday through Friday and on Saturdays we do have doc deliveries to Whole Foods and Market Basket. But most of your dr. Larry you would need a lot of seniority to get those runs unless you are spare and will pick the do so.
good,"pay wasn't enogh for the long hrs and the degrees of difficulties you may face on a day to day bases. Management was ok with helping with a problem, but not with the understanding of the nature and hard work that workers do."
good,"Has great hours and decent benifits.Great for people who can work with little supervision. "
good,the company is fast paced and fires its employees just as easily as they hire you. they say they are about family and balance of work life and family life but they don't really show this in practice.
good,"Nice people, bad management...this place seemed like it was the one...unfortunately it didn't work out because as locations closed...the workload was put upon the remaining staff...which led to an unfavorable review due to upper incompetence..it was us against them"
good,Low Pay.They never made me full time even though I work full time. This is man's work and hard on a woman's body. It is exhausting work to throw all of those boxes and then order. Good freedom.
good,"decent pay, decent hours, lots of work, long hours, home daily, good thing is you have an early start time , you can beat the traffic, no room for advancement,"
good,"Over all a good company to work for."
good,"Great PNW regional team!  If you like to tackle a big job for a lot of clients and help them increase their sales - then you will like this position.  Do not expect a lot of involvement from middle management. This is a great position for someone who is self-directed, motivated and can work from home and the road."
good,"Good company to work need better skilled supervisors "
good,"Good place to work, great team to work with and supportive supervisors.  Good Benefits and pay, great 401k program. Great employee purchase program"
good,This company is an organic food distributor with a focus on healthy living.  They are relocating the Business Services Department to Rhode Island.  Good Mission.
good,If you are a hard worker then Unfi is a good place for you. To be part of the team thanks succeeds is great. Hours are good on the first shift if you like early hours.
good,"Great pay but no communication, worst scheduling, alot of runs barely, time off before next  ,dont care about drivers or customers, just how much freight you can force into trailers, dont care about mispicks or damages."
good,"none stop work, and what I learned was is to stay busy and the management team are ok, my co workers are very friendly, and the hardest part about the job is trying to bet the unrealistic production time for some of the orders....200+items and they give you 1hr... an the enjoyable part of the job is going home after a long day of work and payday"
good,"team players fast pace had long breaks and a 45 minute lunch"
good,As warehouse it is probably no different than any other. You go into work everyday with no idea what time you are getting out. If the demand is high you can be stuck there for over 13 hours at a time.
good,Got to see the new grocery and HBA items that where coming to market. There was a lot of variety in my daily job requirements.
good,"Hiring within wasn't considered at the time, benefits were good, employees were fun to be around, forklift experience, logistics, processing and troubleshooting, and critical thinking, all began at Sun Opta/Unfi,"
good,"Bel environnement, travail d'équipe valorisé"
good,"I was only employed for 3.5 months , I drove an electric pallet jack to pick up customer orders. I wanted to get to working in the freezer but no openings."
good,"its a young persons job,and too many supervisors not enough workers,mandatory hours instead of hiring more workers,too many boses"
good,I enjoyed working at UNFI and found most of the people to be helpful and honest. Supportive management and good benefits. A lot of red tape each year and seemed to be increasing in getting health insurance. Need to be more supportive of the sales staff as they are your bread and butter.
good,"It was a learning experience that taught me a few things about myself."
good,"This is a great learning environment.  I have grown both professionally and personally while working here.  I have advanced my skills.  Overall, a very productive workplace to be in."
good,"UNFI is a good place to work- it is stable, the work atmosphere is good and the people you work with are great. Although advancement is few and far between, the jobs positions themselves are relatively stable."
good,Its a good place to work if you are in the right department. the company outings and holiday party are very well presented and shows the amount of appreciation the company has for its employees
good,picking order and QC the order learning how to Operate Warehouse Equipment
good,"normal warehouse operations.good people,long hours and. I started in consolidation worked to a lead and then became a supervisor.13 years of working their i got 13 years of safety awards.employee of the year in 2006.the one thing that was always a concern of mine was the high turn around of employees and aging equipment other than that not bad .i learned a lot and made some great friendships"
good,worked with nice coworker but the supervisors would not do the jobs they were suppose to so it made the employees job more stressful and longer work days
good,Everyone competes to see who can select the most orders I learned how to stack neatly and work faster
good,"Good job with greats benefits and great pay. Incentive pay for selectors and lift operators once u meet your daily production, up to $1000 on bi-weekly check."
good,"Select pre-orders goods for customers in the food industry. Worked in a fast paced environment, safe and clean."
good,There is plenty of work at unfi. Much of the work is a result of incompetent management and unorganized procedures.
good,"I first started at UNFI as a temp through pro-staff. I had just moved here from Michigan. I was brought in to separate and fix chocolate that had been located in the wrong part of the warehouse during the Texas summer. The manager at that time liked the way I worked. I already knew how to drive all fork lifts and order selectors. He was impressed. He kept me on after the chocolate. I worked in the chill department of the warehouse. Cleaning up discrepancies, locating pallets, looking for lost pallets, cycle counting, putting away returns. Fixing pallets for lift drivers. I did this for four months as a temp. During this time the manager had quit due to the stress. The new manager who took over loved my accuracy, speed, passion and drive. Manager decided to hire me after my four months was up. I pick up on things very quickly. I am easy to teach. I was doing adjustment research after being hired. Any adjustment made in the RF or the WM or WBS system had to be researched a counted. I did this for three months. The position for inventory control Supervisor was posted. I had only been at UNFI permanently for 3 months, but I applied because I believed I would excel in this position. I was awarded the position. And taking this position was the best and the hardest thing I ever did. The manager was great. A great teacher, very knowledgeable of the whole warehouse operations. The associates did not take this very well at all. Most of the inventory team applied and had been there for 2 or more years. I was there 7 months total and got the job. "
good,"A typical day at work consisted of constant cleaning, sweeping, mopping, pulling pallets, riding pallet jacks, forklifts, Scissor lift and filing. I learned new skills and gain experience. My co-workers were friendly, focused, and hard working. The hardest part of the job would be working in the freezer and the most enjoyable part of the job would be the available amount of work, I was always busy."
good,"UNFI can be a really nice place to work, but there is a lot of gossipe that float around inside of the company. The human resource managers have a way of listening to certain employees and not others. HR tend to be influnced by someone that they might like. Matters are never investigated as they should be, thus causing their turnover rate to be very high. Speaking only of the distribution center in lancaster, texas. Management is very poorly ran."
good,Fast paced organic food distribution company
good,It was an equal opportunity employer. And I liked the job. It gave me a chance to work with people of diffierent nationlaities and backgrounds. And the never discriminated.
good,"It was a Union Operations and a hard and though place to work because of the years of neglect and poor employees culture and development!"
good,It is a good stepping stone to how most wharehouse work and will prepare you for possible future in wharehousing and life in general if you have a good work ethic you should have no problem keeping a job with UNFI
good,UNFI is a fast paced job. You are held to a production rate of 95% efficiency. It is a good opportunity for younger individuals starting their careers seeking to gain experience in related fields.
good,UNFI was a good company to work for was there for a year I just felt like when I lost my grandfather they treated me like I was lying they had me providing all types of documentation they never asked other co workers for after providing information I had managers coming to tell me that human services had co workers looking info up on the computers. The work enviorment became really uncomfortable.
good,"I enjoyed working there, it was a good job most of the time. Although in some positions you never knew what time you were getting off work, management was fair at times and sometimes unreasonable."
good,The work is easy and monotonous and can be physically demanding.  Some departments are better than others.  If you work hard and get along with supervisors it is not a bad place to work.
good,I have joined this company switching with 7 year old. In a month an individual similar to my role in Management turn out into a hater and passed racial comments to me and tried to had a physical contact with me by using extremely abusive language. It made myself heart broken and i have to leave this Supervisor position as the investigation process was so slow. Just worked for a month and felt intensive self insecurity with his eyes full of rage always staring at me.
good,"Was  your average good work environment. Montreal office is a very small office, under 10 persons at the office. Very quiet days at times..."
good,"the pay is the only reason why I stayed so long here, other than that if you cant master the skill expect to be there 16 hrs days. your only suppose to work a 4 day week but they man date 6 days"
good,"The biggest challenge at UNFI was sometimes the amount of hours worked per week. I found it difficult sometimes to motivate team members past their physical exhaustion or body limitations. I believe team members loose productivity when worked on a consistent basis 11+ hours. In my experience, it usually result in team members becoming unhappy at home because of lack of time spent. Which also in my experience always result into a unhappy worker."
good,"An environment that has many moving parts and moves quickly.  The facility is quite large and has multiple departments that make up the team (Receiving, Shipping, Transportation, Facilities, Inventory Control, and support staff (i.e. Human Resources)."
good,"Pick orders based on customer needs and did not finish until all work is done in warehouse."
good,"The work/life balance at UNFI and benefits were awful. If you're not in one of the main office branches or know certain individuals  you can't expect any personal development or growth opportunities."
good,Good place to work but very cold and fast paced being a food distribution center.  You are expected to dress warm and learn your job quickly. The pay for associates is one of the top in the county.
good,"A bunch of managers that lacks leaderships. Managers who micro-manage. Great co-workers, true team players. Great and relaxed atmosphere. Tons for free products to try."
good,"This job is the perfect job for someone that can pull up to 75 hours a week, doing the same fast paced mind numbing job each and every day. The pay was good and the benefits were great, but management was severely lacking and productivity was always down to lack of hiring, and not managing a good work flow."
good,"UNFI is a good employer. The best part is the relationships I've developed over the years. Benefits have been outstanding in the past, but seem to be on a slight downward slide, especially regarding healthcare."
good,Pay and benefits are good but work/life balance needs lots of improvement
good,It's a job. Dealing with store managers at accounts is the worst part. 100% commission can be rough. My manager always has my back as long as I'm doing the right things he isn't afraid to go to bat for you. Pretty much make my own hours but you don't get to go home until you are done.
good,I was not able to progress into another role since my manager wanted me to stay in their department.  The culture and people I worked with were awesome
good,good and hard work.  they gave and expected max hours daily!!! manager  at time cared more for stock holders and not the drivers!!!  great at keeping trucks and trailers in good working order...
good,This is an overall ok company to work for it just depends on who you know. There are constant changes in management which make it hard to adjust to the many changes here.
good,I supervised UNFI Warehouse in all areas Grocery Repack Cooler Freezer Loading.  Long Hours with Manditory OT. Customer Focus on accuracy and quality.  Good Benefits and pay is good.. Incentified work productivity based on a percent
good,"You'll be working in a pretty cold environment, at around -35 degrees. Coats provided by the company isn't enough so you have to invest on your own. No food courts so you have to bring your cooked lunch."
good,"As a supervisor always worked 14+ hours, learned a lot and moved up within ranks pretty quickly."
good,uncomfortable place to work forced to work overtime managers will blame maintenace for anything that makes them look good on paper.its very easy to be thrown under the bus by coworkers and production.
good,"UNFI is a mixed bag. They offer pretty great benefits such as 401k, health, dental and vision. The problem lies with the lack of proper hiring every year. Having been there nearly 5 years, I've seen the same pattern every year. They always wait too long to hire when the work load increases and then the whole crew gets stuck working 13-14 hour shifts nearly every day for the next few months until they can play catch up. The chances of moving into a supervisor or higher position is almost zero. There's an opening like once every 2 years and 25 people sign it, so you have a near impossible probability of getting the promotion. To end on a positive note, their pay scale is quite good. You start at over $15 and hour and top out at like $22, which is decent for the work that you are doing, which is almost completely unskilled labor. Overall, if you like the warehouse environment, I'd recommend it over most other warehouses."
good,not much fun at the workplace. The place was very stressful with the bosses sitting on the neck of the floor staff. Not mentoring and no advancement. People comes in and leave frequently
good,"I liked my job as a repack replenisher they have deleted that position. Three of the 4 days that I work i am still doing that job.what bothers me is the fact that my supervisor lies to us all the time. There is no really tough parts of the job. The people that I work with can be real fun. "
good,enjoyed working here but reigned due to the fact of a union strike lost a ton of business overall nice people to work with and would recommend working here
good,Awesome place to work I truly enjoyed the time i spent there as a order selector. I learned how to quickly and safely select organic food orders in a cooler and dry wharehouse environment.
good,If yo want to work like a dog for a nice paycheck this is the place mandatory overtime everyday. Stack pallets 6 ft tall every night. I usually start at 12 don't leave until 11 at night. Nice paycheck but it isn't worth the strain on your body. Oh yea you could make up to $4 extra an hour if you can pick at 100% or above
good,"People in management who don""t care or take the time to truly address employees concerns.Very diverse company everybody is friendy."
good,"Great People, very BIG Company.  Lots of autonomy in the field and with Accounts, difficult to secure resources outside of what was made available."
good,"a typical day at work for me is to get my computer up and working"
good,A typical day will be filled with challenges that will make the average individual think outside the box and to interact with multiple parts of a company.
good,You had to work hard and keep up or you would get written up and left go If you couldn't make quota. The pay was good the insurance was excellent. I didn't like that we had to work overtime all of the time we couldn't go home until all of the work was done.
good,"Job(s) get very repetitive, but it greatly varies depending on your job function. Takes a long while to get the hang of procurement lingo and responsibilities. Compensation is average, time off is average. Flexible work from home once a week after 6 months of employment."
good,Room to move up fast but hard to trust management. Great overtime but poor guidelines. Lots of frustration in the air and HR reps will fire you with no notice.
good,"I liked working for U.N.F.I but they have a lot of improvement to do.a typical day at work consisted of putting pallets away and replenishing pick slots. I learned to receive and how to work in timely manner. Management needs to get off their high horse and join the action too, Co- Workers need a break and the most enjoyable part was going home."
good,"Stocking, picking orders, transferring pallets to other warehouses, fast paced environment, fun work environment."
good,"Good Benefits,But we can work up to 16 hours in one day,no set time to get off.Sure we get three days off but you be too tired to spend time with your family."
good,"a typical day at work is fast paste, my coworkers are great teachers to the new employees who come in. Management at times chooses to show a blind eye to some of the things that go on which at time cause the work environment to be a little hostile."
good,Decent organization to be apart of. Allowed to recruit and hire as what was best for the company and the positions that were open. Really focus on having an positive work environment.
good,Open my day with daily check of pti check list ...supervisor was very pushy on getting equipment that was scarce ..no informative relationship with supervisor unless its involvement of sports or debate. .human resource department is awesome + some managers..overall great experience...I hope the next company I'm with greet me as family...thanks for the experience unfi atlanta
good,"Dsc offers great benefits,"
good,Working at California Mantle was a great over all epieriance. It was my first job and i learned alot about having a hard work ethic and work values as well. It was a great stepping stone to being as successful as i can in my work life.
good,Be prepared to work long shifts. Shift is not complete until all orders have been completed. Slower during the summer. Sundays a must. 4 day work weeks. 5 day work weeks during the winter months. Start time is 9 a.m. High turnover rate. Immediate benefits.
good,"The management for the most part is hired from within so they understand the problems and hardships of the job. The supervisors sometimes take thier jobs too seriously and tend to clash with employees. The supervisors clash with employees cause they used too be in their position, so they want to assert thier power to show thier importance. The atmosphere is that your never really doing enough or that you could be doing more. You are paid inventively so it's your choice, but sometimes its feels like they push it on you. The system for employees is broken, 100% is where you need to be not to get fired. The average worker wont last very long, need to be super motivated to maintain employment."
good,More training ......old magmt needed to go we need fresh ideas new time new beginning old magmt don't now nothing can't even lead....stoppp writing people up for dumb stuff...untill we fix the problems in house...stop  the writing ups you'll running people out  #  wrong approch #wrong politics #we have good people here
good,I was an op replener in repack. I really loved what I did and most of my team mates and supervisors. It's good hard work but you can do it if you try. Worked 2nd shift starting at noon couldn't complain if I got off Before 3 am. Idk how I feel about upper management or hr. Probably better left unsaid. Good pay not a bad job
good,"Tedious place to work, Very one dimensional and you get no support from the higher ups a very me first workforce no teamwork at all"
good,"You can definitely make good money here but the hours for my previous job there were very hard to handle for me. Tons of overtime when people call out sick, which happens a lot."
good,"On a typical work I would head to my first stop on my territory. Greet store management, survey company product, check for damaged, out of codes, out of stock, and customer request. Work back stock and write credit if needed. While writing order, do a follow-up walk thru and check with management before I leave. Repeat this cycle the rest of the day. There may be a few deliveries scheduled in some stops. So they would be merchandise.  For the most part,  I've worked well with management (e.g. grocery, assistant, store managers), and receivers too. Always try to have a positive attitude, even under difficult circumstances. The most important thing, good communication and keep my customers happy."
good,Easy work not your typical call center environment. Over all a good place to work. Management is decent. If you have attendance issues don't work here!!
good,"arrive before shift at 4:00 am have meeting then released to position on the dock , recieved products coming into  stock , identify the product, count label and release to be stocked in the warehouse,"
good,It wasnt a bad experience. i learned how to be hard worker working at UnFI because it was a very physical job but at the same time i didnt have no life because i had to spend 16 to 20 hrs everyday at work and thats why i quit
good,If you not use to hard wrk this job is not for you. Thats means your mind got to be right to wrk in this type of inverment. But it depends how bad you need the money. They paid me right but treated me bad our should i had enough. No hard feelings thats life.
good,The place isn't horrible to work for as far as pay.....as far as your typical corporate company you're pretty much replaceable as most big companies.  No REAL job security.
good,"this place is good for work life balance; however, management communication is terrible and very little opportunities to advance - politics are huge here so not a long term place to be at"
good,Great pay and benefits but I dont understand how your transportion manager can be your boss but does not have a CDL or has never done your job.Very confusing!
good,good work place loved my coworkers. some of the supervisors and managers were disrespectful and mean. because they have the power of authority they think they can just treat workers the way they want to. but overall it was a fun work environment because of the workers.
good,UNFI has a very fast paced culture and they are very unforgiving when it comes to mistakes or lack of speed when selecting. They do however provide excellent benefits and compensation
good,"Instead of people being assigned a schedule based on good work ethic, they are assigned by seniority. A lot of poor management and laziness. part of a Union (brotherhood) where no one actually looks out for one another. Also, no benefits to being part of the Union. Paying union dues every month for ""job security"""
good,"Fast pace, sometimes long days.  Good benefits and pay, poor work life balance.  Good incentive program if your a motivated worker will make money, however work life balance is not great for family."
good,"Shipping and Receiving, packaging and loading box's  on pallet then to the loading dock"
good,I liked my job because I had the freedom to work my route and handle all situations with little or no supervision. They had good benefits.
good,"Select account product ordering, merchandising, problem solving and product education for account associates."
good,We still on a 5 day schedule. I barely get to spend time with family. I’m always at work. Life doesn’t matter when it come to unfi. They don’t give you all your pto.
good,Great place to work when we was working out of Cardinal health yard in Montgomery N.Y when they opened the new warehouse everything fall apart. Everything got very disorganized. Every employee in the warehouse was new and it was a lot of mistakes.
good,"It's good pay lot's hour to work , friendly place to work with.. Lot's of job opportunities. Good benefit like good vision, good midical and good dental"
good,"very fast paced, because of there location we always had a herd time getting applicates, but the ones we got we could hire really worked out, I made a mistake in leaving them and if I could take it back I would."
good,"I typically driver a full trailer to a domicile driver from Denver to Casper Wyoming on Monday night.  From Tuesday night to Thursday night I driver a team route with deliveries in Tulsa, OK, Fayetteville, AR, Harrison, AR, Springfield, MO and Joplin, MO then back to Denver.  On Friday night I driver a full trailer to a domicile driver in Hays, KS.  All totaled, about 55 to 60 hours per week.  We are payed by the hour at UNFI and that I why I prefer to work there.  I have done numerous routes that require mountain driving in very poor weather, requiring a lot of chaining up."
good,"UNFI remains true to its culture. Leadership make decisions that can sometimes seem like odd business choices, but it is all in an effort to keep to the core values of the company."
good,It is a great place to learn basics of Supply Chain. It is a food and natural product distribution company with sites throughout the United States and Canada.
good,"this is a real live warehouse.Plan on standing, bending, pulling, lifting you whole shift. work pay is great but hour are long never know what time you will get off. Not much room for growth but you will get a raise yearly"
good,Very good place to work pay is great an work is not really hard but you do have to work and its cold so if you cant work in the cold weather dress very comfortably and you have production rates you have to hit
good,"Great pay and benefits, never home, always expected to be on call. As long as you have had your 10 hrs off your expected to return to work. takes over 2 years to get a set rout schedual."
good,Great place to work if you can keep up.  Good workout and the pallet jacks are really fun to ride.  Still miss working there.
good,"After 2 and  half years with UNFI, I've had 3 VPs, and 2 Directors Unfortunately the company is promoting people who have no previous skills with  people management and some of the managers do not come with any type of business professionalism or etiquette. "
good,I loved working at UNFI and would still be there had it not been for layoffs due to restructuring. I believe in the products they sell and their sales team is top notch. Best company I've ever worked for.
good,"UNFI is an ethical company that treats its employees well.  Management in the area that I have worked in has been quite satisfactory.  Customer- facing positions do have the disadvantage of often working the holidays, depending on the customers' needs.  Overall, I like working at UNFI."
good,"UNFI is a team oriented work environment. I have learned to multi task, problem solve and have polished my customer service skills. The management team is supportive and offers continued guidance when needed. I enjoy the interaction with the customers and the employees through out the process of meeting client needs."
good,"It's a great job, the coworkers are nice."
good,"Start time early in the morning, pretrip the truck & trailer."
good,There is nothing special about working there. Its like any other warehouse I've worked at. The one exception being fully vesting employees after five years of service.
good,fast pace working envoirment. nice employees good management
good,"I run/produce a lot of reports and send many emails to customers every morning.  These include invoice, coversheet, and proof of deliveries. I might have projects assigned by my supervisor or manager that I have to do.  Most people I work with are laid back and go with the flow.  Everyone is very nice.  The hardest part of my job is trying to stay busy.  Most of the time I have enough work to keep me busy, but sometimes I am waiting on work from my superiors.  The most enjoyable part of my job is getting my hands on a lot of different projects and departments.  I have worked with our cash application department and also our claims department."
good,I started as a basic lift truck mobile mechanic. I worked in the field for three years. I moved into parts consignments. I would spend the morning gathering orders and planning my trip. The latter half of the day would be spent delivering parts and completing inventories. The hardest part of the job was being gone so much. The best part of the job was the people that I met.
good,"With UNFI I worked the second shift. My job was one that included elements of human resources, customer service, as well as manual labor. As a member of the operations team at UNFI I learned to work within a team structure meeting group and individual goals. UNFI helped me gain valuable information in regards to the food industry, as well as overall warehouse work."
good,Supervisors flimsy at best. They will gladly stab you in the back if given the chance. Managers are very good. Company has great benefits. HR not always so honest. Building so clean you could eat off the floor.
good,"You take inventory in the stores of your authorized items, write orders to replenish the shelves, up sell to gain incremental displays AND most importantly— you are the person who packs put the order you wrote when it’s delivered to the stores."
good,"Good place to work for a single man or single woman long hours good pay No life  "
good,Crazy overtime but good money.   That would about the only thing I can think of and since I have write 150 characters for this stupid review this is me rambling. There 172.
good,My time at UNFI was actually good got along good with just about everyone. it's a love hate relationship with this place if i could go back i would  i was good at my job there most of people there are okay  some idk  but as long as you did your job  no one really complained.
good,Really enjoyed my time at UNFI INC . The management was fair and the people I worked with were very professional. I only wished I would've been warned about certain policies so that I would've done a few things different and could've remained at the company.
good,The workplace culture is professional and pleasant. The workload can regularly exceeds 40 hours a week. Above average turnover in management. Employees may have a new manager every one or two years.
good,"I enjoyed the independence I had with this  field rep position I had. We were able to manage the territory that we were given within guidelines set forth by supervisor and delivery dept. I don’t think the accounts were managed well at higher levels in the company. We lost Smart and Final to a competitor which resulted in my job loss with UNFI. We started with well over 1500 sku’s Of products in Ralphs Grocery Co., and when I left we were probably around 300-400. Opening set orders ranged 7-8 pallets, 1full dairy and frozen. Opening set orders for new store is about 1-2 pallets of grocery now. Other than that, the pay seemed adequate for the job responsibilities . If my supervisor called me back to offer a similar position, I would take it."
good,Was a great temporary job while I was in college. The staff was very friendly and always willing to help if there was an issue. Training was provided at hire.
good,"Would work there again,  Very philanthropic sustainable company. Many opportunities for associate involvement and charitable giving.  Good benefits, 401k, etc,"
good,Job is a challenge but the environment is positive. Holidays are a challenge but you are paid overtime so it’s well worth it. This company has an excellent sense of teamwork.
good,"Good place to work with opportunities for advancement. Many benefits to employees including tuition assistance, health benefits, company events and employee market."
good,"Overall was good, but after the buyout,basically lied about keeping the company separate. When it was Haddon House, a much better experience.  After the guy or, typical corporate takeover procedures.  Cut, and save"
good,A typical work day envolves a lot of email correspondence. I have learned the ins and outs of behind the scenes corporate. Dealing with business systems and learning data entry. How to credit a customer. The management is outstanding. The hardest part of the job is multitasking between emails and day to day responsibilities but the challenge makes it fun and exciting. The most enjoyable part of the job is all of the outstanding management and team building exercises we do. I feel like the workplace culture has gotten very better over the years and I am proud to be a UNFI employee.
good,"I would pick orders along with many other people . I learned how to pay very close attention to bar code numbers and to double or triple check before moving on . Management was on top of everything and i was very impressed on how the company operated on a daily basis . the hardest part of the job was the quota involved with picking . You needed to pick so many packages an hour with no mispicks . the best part of the job was riding around picking orders listening to music was allowed via phone ,Ipod,or MP3"
good,"I was able to build on my already extensive customer service experience in this position.  I was also able hone my skills with Microsoft Office, specifically Excel.  My knowledge of legal agreements, specifically supplier agreements and their technical nature is another skill I will use that dovetails with my detail oriented approach to work."
good,enjoyed working with UNFI will miss this company. we all work together to get everyone's work done together.  we had a multitude of different cultures and we all meshed together well.
good,Typical day is peaceful.  Micromanagement is minimal. Most co-workers are cordial.  Hardest part of day is when co-workers are not inspired to start work and its most enjoyable when they are.
good,I did door to door sales at new residential area and able to work under hot sun. I'm able to communicate with customers and also gained experiences from my leader.
good,"It's a great company that has always valued making good food available to all, connecting farms to families, and continues a mission to create and advocate sustainability with regard to their eco-conscious facilities and how the food they offer is sourced.  And they give millions every year to righteous causes all over the world.  They are a company to be proud to work for."
good,"Even though this was a seasonal job, I enjoyed the job and to learn how These actual trucks are loaded a certain way"
good,"A typical day at work began with prioritizing the day's tasks to complete in a timely fashion. Cash reporting, check inventory adjustments, review weekly auto journal entries, review MDF invoices, and resolve any net cost, banking, or MDF issues."
good,"Good Team, Growing company.  It is food Distribution so there is some compromise on holidays if you are part of some of the operations.  Can be some long hours."
good,I enjoyed my time at UNFI as a Field Sales Representative. The workload was fairly high but manageable and there was a good support system from other reps and management.
good,"Opportunity to advance was fantastic,  really felt as if they wanted me to succeed,  the system in which they prefer to promote from with in is excellent for advancement."
good,Associates are good and hard working. HR does not really represent people. No follow-up. Does not listen to both sides. Culture is not consistent. Changes as positions open up in management.They talk about it when applying but if not promoted they go back to their old ways.
good,"Good place to work."
good,"Job was awesome.  I worked in the field and mainly worked alone but when there was a major job the other merchandisers worked slow because of their age.  They need to Hire employees that can perform the job to the set standard.  When 3/4 of the team is about to retire or they can retire then they tend to work slower and have the I don't care attitude, which makes it harder for the employees who want their job. "
good,"I typically work 12 to 13 hours. This job is very demanding at times. At times, it is very rewarding and the new GM is doing a good job of correcting some of the production issues that have held us back. The new management seems to be changing the D.C. in a positive way."
good,"Work flow didn't always give time for effective use of cross training techniques for appropriate staffing. Local managers and directors have little impact on corporate decision making, sometimes leading to feeling left in the dark."
good,Learned a lot. Good people to work with.  Management very political with people who did not know there job and constantly changing.  A good deal of favoritism was often problematic.
good,"Typical distribution selector position. Repetitive, mindless, order selection. They had small, grocery and cooler/freezer positions. The best part of the job was going home."
good,"Time fly at UNFI, there are always new projects and many changes to cross over. during the last 10+ years with UNFI I was challenged with many changes to keep up with the fast growth and I had the privilege to work with hard working professionals who carried the company's vision with great pride and ownership. during my journey with UNFI, I gained so much knowledge and grew to obtain new skills every time I was tested with new project or change. UNFI greatest assets are the people who believed in its mission."
good,If you have a hustler mentality and are not afraid of hard work then you will like this place. The hours and work can get overwhelming but if you stick it out then you will have a nice fat paycheck. There's also incentive pay if you work hard. Benefits are also pretty good.
good,"A typical day at UNFI is to be pro-active in preparing tasks to be ""close"" ready, and providing support to business partners."
good,I enjoyed working at Unfi because the salary rate can afford me and my family. I worked there and liked it but it was a short term for me since I was hired from a staffing.
good,"A fast-paced crazy work environment that requires a lot of energy. It's not easy when your workday depends on the orders of the day meaning you won't be able to leave until they are all fulfilled. However, the pay was above decent."
good,rely trucks getting there on time and products being on trucks. Management was good and the most enjoyable part was meeting people in the stores and accounts.
good,"A typical day at work entailed picking up a pick order, completing the list, and returning to collect another pick order. The hardest part of the job was enduring other associates and their attitudes. The most enjoyable part of working at UNFI was the freedom of speed and comfort knowing the operator collected the correct items."
good,Salary and benefits are good. People are okay to work with but for someone who lives far from the area it is not enough to make me stay on the job plus it is physically taxing.
good,"The management knows their job and role in the company. They take care of their workers. "
good,"I clock in,i pick and pack for 4 hours,then take a lunch,then i start picking and packing until the we finish with all the products that need to be shipped out."
good,"A great place to work, great people and good salary. Great work-life balance and great benefits. I enjoy working here and enjoy the people I work with."
good,"My whole experience here was one of ongoing improvement. like any other warehouse ive been in, it was very fast paced and there was a daily quota to make. But the management worked close with the employees always trying to improve the quality and efficiency of receiving and shipping of the product."
good,UNFI is a good  place to start career in the food warehouse industry.  You can learn may positive traits and the environment there is always positive.
good,"Overall a great company with good benefits, a good place to work, the management is just not good. The pay is great and they give you a lot of overtime hours as needed."
good,"The company back in 2012 was relatively new and had a lot of minor things to fix. the pay was great. The hours were bad sometimes getting 80hrs in a work week,"
good,"Very fast paced job functions, challenging."
good,"UNFI is an incredible company that is growing and consistently changing to be a company that represents the product they carry.  UNFI strives to focus on internal culture, sustainability, and philanthropic initiatives."
good,I worked from 12 in the afternnon till about 2 or 3 in the morning. I replenished slots and helped fill orders daily. My co-workers and management were enjoyable and easy to get along with. The hardest part of my job was not having job securityand the most enjoyable part of my day was interacting with the co-workers and the team work it took to finish the job.
good,Unloading an loading pallet for trucks and pulling orders. Enjoyed the serenity of being alone in cooler at times .
good,Company that UNFI was supplying product to decide to stock there own products so no service level was needed by UNFI. Which create the lay-off. Store chain could get the products cheaper and stock the products themselves.
good,"If you have been in distribution long enough, you know it can be rewarding and a challenge. The one certainty is there is always changes. Goal's, management, and crew to name a few. I was fortunate to work with some great people, and like any operation you run across those who are not a pleasure to work with. Like anywhere, you have the ones that works the system which damages what could be a great culture.  Fortunately there are those who will step up."
good,"Very fast paced and demanding. Lots of hours worked. Great culture. Learned a lot of new strategies, and skills pertaining to my field of work. Very busy and great compensation."
good,"Repack dept. is pretty laid back yet competive the pay decent and the works not too bad. Theres not a lot of down time and you generally dont know when your going to finish your shift. The supervisors are nice, but higher ups are a mess."
good,"It really depends what department/team you get into. My first job was average at best. My current position is enjoyable! Management is very good and accommodating where possible. As a growing company, there are challenges working within different business systems."
good,Overall good place to work. Management was good teamwork was good. Training was good. Pay was great. Paid weekly. Alot of overtime hours. One of best experiences.
good,"The food industry is very competitive, so every day was a learning experience. My food industry and food safety education continued. Management was very knowledgeable, all business. Workplace culture was all business. Hardest part of the job: interdepartmental synergy. Most enjoyable part of the job: the people, my managers, my support staff, my team."
good,"As a whole, UNFI is a great company, well run and with excellent ethics. But the Lancaster location is like the black sheep of the family. In 5 years of working there we went through 7 GM's. That's 7 captains of the ship that could not turn around a messy warehouse and messy management. It seems like the place was built on some ancient burial ground and it is haunted. Not by spirits but by something that keeps it from getting it together in inventory control, shipping, on time deliveries, keeping clients happy. I like a little chaos in my work but this was a bit too much. However, I did appreciate the job."
good,"Good place to work nice work conditions and other employees help support you, Managers don't hound you and there is a easy working condition and every day is not the same."
good,"Looking to do warehouse work. Hard worker, hoping to transfer within my current comapany Unfi in the California area but if not... Fresh start in a great company."
good,Sucks having split days off but the pays pretty decent driving a stand-up pallet jack selecting orders some orders are easier than others good job for someone willing to work long hours and hard for their money
good,"I can't complain about the pay, but very few days off. You work most holidays even if your clients are closed! The medical benefits could be better (they cover 80% of everything) which really adds up."
good,"Great place to work, great benefits, great pay but horrible hours. Anywhere from 14-16hr shifts . 1 day off per week and the management most of the time are not understanding."
good,"Order, stock, merchandise and position company product."
good,"Typical work day:"
good,"The job I was hired for, was a departure from my career objectives and had no involvement with Purchasing.  It was an IT job, which is not in my field.  Company said they would train me in IT, but it was not a good fit, so I left the company."
good,"Only left due to layoff"
good,"Great pay easy work "
good,I enjoy warehouse so I like this work environment! Some things could be better but the pay and benefits are worth the come/up I call it! Its my daily workout!!!!!!
good,They raised their salary to meet with competitors. It's a very peaceful working environment and has good job security like RRSP matching and benefits.
good,"UNFI is a great company to work for that takes care of their employees. There are many good people working there, and plenty of discounted food to purchase. Also plenty of volunteering opportunities as well."
good,A typical day included ordering and stocking shelves with product along with building displays.  We would introduce new products for consumers to try.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work independently with limited supervision.  The hardest part of the job would be how time consuming holiday hours are.
good,UNFI is a great company to work for. They provide a good benefits package as well as a competitive wage. I liked the hours for 1st shift too.
good,The hours were unpredictable and schedule changes were constant. But the culture of the company was awesome and management as well as HR were truly about the employees. The pay was great and the benefits were out of this world.
good,"I ran various report and charts every day with an extensive use of Excel and PowerPoint.  I learned a lot about Excel and organic living.  The management was a bit ""old fashioned"" with their management style, but I could see the changes that were being implemented and are now completely different than when I first started.  My co-workers were some of the the best parts of my day. They were very supportive and continue to be friends today.  The most difficult part of my job was the lack of customer interaction.  I learned a lot about the inner working and different departments of UNFI (i.e. warehouse, purchasing, business analysis, sales, finance/ accounting, customer service).  The most enjoyable part of the job was the ability to broaden my views of non-GMO foods, the organic, natural food and health industry as a whole."
good,Good place to work.  Would have to relocate to move up the ranks though.
good,A lot of opportunity for overtime and room for advancement.  Great schedules with days off
good,Its a decent place to work but the pay could be better. Work lifestyle is okay - sometimes under-appreciated but the benefits are a plus.
good,Fast pace food distribution environment.  Customer orders changed daily. Good working environment.
good,"Typical day?  You work 4 ten hour days, but really, you don't leave until the job is done (not a complaint, but reality).  "
good,Fast pace
good,"Good place to work,typical day would involve reporting to work picking up an order to be selected using an electric pallet jack.Good management and team leaders,friendly co-workers.Hardest part of the job was meeting quota.Most thing i enjoy about this job is that is a hands on and fast pace enviroment."
good,It’s not a bad place to work if you want to work long hours some nights and every year you stay there your pay goes up a dollar but if u go in the cooler you get a dollar and freezer you get
good,"I loved working here as I have small kids, I was able to work around my schedule to facilitate the needs of my family. Compensation was mostly commissioned"
good,Lots of physical work required but it is a great job with good benefits and pay . You will never be bored it is great for drivere who dont want to just drive.  Customers are great and the company has a lot of benefits
good,"Those you work at UNFI will find that they will be working long hours, upwards of 50 hours, but the work is fulfilling and the pay is good. Certain areas reach -20 degrees, but they will suit you to be able to work in those environments. Do be prepared to work in any type of area though."
good,"Good long hard working days, good management, helpful people must be able to put in the work to earn equal pay. You can pick your own days and hours and place to run routes"
good,Lots of opportunities to grow within the company when available and many departments that you can try to work for as well. Enjoyed my time at UNFI. Great benefits package.
good,"I have been very happy working for UNFI. The pay seems to be higher than most other companies in the industry. The job itself is great, you have a lot of freedom and very little stress. As long as you are preforming well your boss will trust you to manage yourself, and you should receive an annual raise. I would recommend working here."
good,"Ambiente de trabajó dinámico y con presion, overtime todos los días y con mucha frecuencia hasta los días de descanso, a sido el mejor empleo que e tenido."
good,"Great place to work!   People treated you like family.  Fast paced office, phones were busy but not overwhelming."
good,Great place to work..... communication great throughout the company....... management style focused on employees..... very involved and committed to surrounding companies.
good,"Daily reporting , order entry, projects given by managers."
good,"Loved working there. Was laid off due to time on job and new management responsible to show a higher profit margin very quickly. Learned much to contribute to my customer service skills, DOT regulations, had 86 drivers which also contributed to help drivers on the road with service calls, T-Cheks/Com checks, also software used for tracking drivers, trailers and temperature requirements .Just a small amount of all I was able to add to my knowledge in the transportation industry."
good,"I enjoyed working here good people to work with on a daily, fast paced environment with your choice of shifts that very. The pay is fair with a chance to grow."
good,"good place to work, great team atmosphere, easy job with fairly easy routine follow on a daily basis. interaction with public is best part of the job."
good,This company is slowly growing. Opportunity for advancement is also slowly growing. Very low pressure management. Lots of free and discounted organic food.
good,"Everyday is basically the same with small variations. Management is attentive and do want the employees to be happy. Morale tends to vary based on how a person handles the job itself. The hardest part of the job is the hours; most nights are 12 hours. The best part is when you finish an order and place it. Overall it's a great company, but the work is hard and the hours are long."
good,"Great place to  work!"
good,"I was in the front of the building when I worked there and the staff up there for the most part are very helpful and welcoming. When I first started working there, I really didn't get the training that I should of, they seemed very busy and preoccupied with other issues that were going on at the time. I had to do a lot of learning with trial and error."
good,"I WORKED ON THR SECOND SHIFT WHERE WE START WORK AT 1pm. i go in and first get my machine in place depending on what I'm assigned to do. we don't have a specific time we close. we work till every order is shipped out. on the average, we do like 10 hours daily. since being there I've learnt how to use the jack and forklift. they've programs for individual and community development. management is quite good and there are friendly people there. its quite a tough job especially selecting and the long hours but it pays well. the fun part about it is when you get to travel to other branches in different states to work. overall its a good place to work."
good,"Good hrs great pay, room for advancement its a little bit of work though not just driving, you have to unload and that is a challenge a lot of the time because they batch pick, and it makes the drivers life very difficult  some times all the burden is put on the driver."
good,This was one of the best companies  to work for from the field  work to being in the office. I would still be here if they did not lose the contract for Specialty Foods
good,"Select product for Whole foods and surrounding natural food stores."
good,"I enjoyed all my co-workers, and the freedom the company gave us as far as what we an wear.  The management and the systems need some updating, they were not always on the same page and it was frustrating at times."
good,"a typical day at work fun, i learned people have different problem, good management well trained, co-workers are nice helps others , making sure all departments are fully staff, working with the people"
good,The people who work there and the management are friendly and helpful for the most part. The job has a high turnover rate which is unfornate and slows down the experienced pickers and often leads to forced me to vertime or longer nights
good,"Constantly changing and evolving to meet the future of food. Internal groups are doing their best to meet a variety of demands from internal customers, external customers, suppliers, etc."
good,Stable job. Good benefits.holidays off. Helpful supervisors. Friendly co-workers.It is a fast paced work evironment..detail and customer oriented. The company is a distributer of organic foods and materials. They have facilities nation wide as well as in Canada.
good,"They treat their employees fairly. Pay well, offer good benefits after a couple months probation period. Competitive, fast, challenging work environment."
good,Great job.. Pretty good hours.. Lots of overtime.. They do provide benifts atfer a few months.. They pay was all that great.. I've heard that they have increased they pay since then.. Overall a good company.
good,The company was a great place to work till we were bought out by another company. System problems with the change over made it harder for our employees and customers.
good,All of my managers were supportive of a work/family work balance. I was able to work remotely as needed. I had opportunities to learn new technical skills.
good,"This job is great for those are drive by speed. If you love to be in a fast working environment then UNFI is the place for you. They are really good with working around your schedule in order to ensure their employees are well taken care of,over all a very well establishment."
good,On a grading scale of one to five ireceived I scored mostly fours. Which was very good. Rarely did they give a five grade. Reason being is there is always room for improvement
good,This was a good place to work at. The customers were always taken care of when there was a pallet missing we would have to let the company know at the time of delivery. And when they were notified they would put a pallet on an available truck asap. And the customers were always satisfied with the service
good,picking orders from 8 AM until all the orders are done and completed for the day. Hardest part of the job was trying to be quick and catch up when theres either traffic or a spill. Most enjoyable part was the employees were great.
good,"If you want to work and get paid off your work you should definitely give it a shop you might find it interesting and motivating. It’s also a good way to maintain physical fitness due to the walking, lifting, and stacking while also earning a Nice pay check at the end of the week! Did I say it was weekly?? Well it’s also located in Montgomery ,NY"
good,Gestion autonome de la journée de travail. Tâches variées et non-routinières au courant de la semaine. Culture d'entreprise motivante axée sur la responsabilité environnementale et sociale. Avantages sociaux compétitifs
good,"I truly loved working for this company. While I may only be able to speak for myself as many have had different experiences, the time I spent at UNFI was adequately compensated for while my concerns were adressed in a timely and sufficient manner."
good,UNFI was a company that offered union coverage and great benefits and required a lot of time and energy but enabled you to learn warehousing and supply and demand very properly
good,Enjoyed the independence and autonomy of my field sales representative position.  I was getting into the rhythm of the stores I oversaw and was looking to grow.  It took about 3-4 months to get a handle on the ordering and usage. I established relationships with the store personnel immediately. Meet a lot of very nice people. Contract was prematurely cancelled.
good,UNFI is a fast-paced distribution work culture.  I became friends with associates from a wide -based multi-cultural backgrounds.  The managers were always available to assist any way they could to help us with any issues we may have come across.
good,"UNFI was a good place to work. Excellent team members, working with customers on a daily basis was quite enjoyable. My position offered me the opportunity to travel to Oregon where I've since relocated. Immediate supervisors made themselves available. Great benefits and discounts. I learned more excel and access program skills that I hadn't known before. It was very fast paced, which I also enjoyed."
good,a good place to work fun people good management close to home I really got a long with my co worker we listen to the radio all day it made my day easy..
good,The items you are required to select are alot of time in the wrong slots and when you pick the wrong item it counts as a mispick even though the guys doing the put away are being lazy.
good,"Only been there for nearly 2 months, workers are great, friendly and very helpful. However, these management expect for every order picker to meet 105 qouta per hr which is impossible. Thinking about it gives me a lil stress. Aside from that it's very good place to work at. Organized."
good,"Working in the warehouse, my day would start at noon, and would typically last until 10 pm, although the end of the day would vary based on how many trucks we had to load, and how much each customer ordered. I would drive a reach truck and bring down pallets of product to lower levels so that the pickers, who build the pallets with customer's products, could have the products available. It was a fast-paced job, my hourly wage increased after 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. The schedule was 4 ten-hour days per week, with the option to work one or two of your days off to get an extra 10-20 hours of work when you needed it, or you could have yourself a 3-day weekend, which was nice to have when you needed it."
good,"I took a lot of pride in my work for this employer. They really appreciated my work ethic and abilities, as well as my personality. The benefits and the pay were terrific."
good,"I worked here and it was probably the best job that I have had. There is a reason that most of the employees work here for 20+ years. Management is great and so are the coworkers. The hours varied for my position for about 9 months but evened out to set hours after that. My only regret is that I left, but it is not the career for me."
good,"Very busy atmosphere, never a dull moment. Non stop business decisions. Overall a great team environment. 24 hour business schedule. Endless opportunities to move up the chain."
good,be ready to work and very fat pace demanding physical job. be ready to work up to ten to 15 hours day. the employees are friendly and very helpful. be

good,"busy start(sometimes heavy depending order given)"
good,I loved working here I think everything about this establishment just screams great production and i would advise anyone and everyone to apply.
good,"UNFI is a great company to work for- the pay can be on the lower end, but the company really cares for its employees.  They do have many benefits that make up for that drawback."
good,"A typical day was fun, we use to compete with each to see who can Replenish more on the forklift. That made the time go by fast also. But Management and Supervisors would good to work with, my co workers was a team player."
good,picked orders learned how to drive a pallet jack and use scanners good managers great people to work with the hardest part is if we got behind on loading trucks and getting orders done the most enjoyable part was when we get all of our orders picked and done for the day
good,"This company mandated way too much overtime which was very invasive on family time and my kids. Good pay, good benefits but there is no room for error here at all. You must work at a certain percentage and if you cant you are at risk of loosing your job. Its very unsettling.  Also a very physical job."
good,"As a supervisor most days are filled with removing roadblocks for associates."
good,"Since starting at UNFI I have grown as an individual and added to my rapidly expanding skill set."
good,"I learned a lot working at United Natural Foods especially since I have not worked at a place like this before. It was interesting to me how a food line was distributed out to all the competing grocery stores and what items were the most popular. In that sense, that is how I found my position there. The work environment was fun, light and casual. I very enjoyed working for that company."
good,Loved every bit of it. Pushed me to become a hard worker. Great co-workers and just overall fun place to work.
good,Pretty busy the whole time at work. All aspects of warehousing is what I learned. Management was easy to work with. Co-workers were easy to work with. Management was a little tough at times. Co-workers and the chance to advance was the best part my job there.
good,"A very conducive environment to work, but I had to move close to home."
good,"The day went fast , loved servicing my acct, work was fun but the job got done"
good,Sustainably is an important footprint for the company. They were always striving to find an environmentally enhanced way of doing business. Customers satisfaction drives the heart of the company
good,UNFI is a great place to work. UNFI offers great starting pay for the associates and there is enough overtime hours. the company is expanding greatly which offers great opportunities for associates especially if you are willing to relocate.
good,"I loved UNFI, for the most part. I think they are straying from their initial goal of being a distributor of Organic and Natural foods to competing too much with Amazon and catering to stockholders. Their focus has moved from people to profit, to the detriment of their company and employees."
good,Once a week we have a team development meeting. This allows the entire team to interact with one other and voice everyone's opinion and updates any information regarding the work place.
good,Greats hours and I love working at a fast pace.  I learned a lot about safety.  Management was outstanding and pushed you to get faster with production on a daily basis.  The hardest part of the job was keeping up with Guys that been there for years.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the activities we participated in.
good,"Truly a shining star of a company to work for.  This company consumed my former company in 2016, and pushed our company forward while giving consideration to proper treatment of employees. The culture from the top down, was phenomenal, always allowing employees to voice opinions.  The benefits package was also excellent!"
good,It was decent enough if you can get through the first 3 months of adjusting to the environment than you can make it there with no problems.  Diligence
good,"Everything has deadlines, be prepared for a fast paced and strict working atmosphere. Room for growth and pay increases. Good management and perks working with UNFI. (discounts, lunches, etc). They offer great benefits as well. Long work days and crazy schedules."
good,"This place isn't for everyone. If you like moving fast, non-stop for 10+ hours a day then this is for you! Good benefits and great pay! Management is top notch."
good,"ENJOYED the JOB a lot - management and workers very helpful"
good,"•	Responsible For having a strong understanding of equipment, pick locations, pallet building, productivity measures and safety procedures."
good,typical day starts with a team stretch and friendly banter.  management is easiy accessible to all associates. Co-workers are friendly and helpful. the hardest part of the job is the repetions. The most enjoyable part of the day is the team meeting.
good,"I had an extremely satisfying career with UNFI.  I enjoyed my position because it was challenging yet rewarding.  My team was knowledge, professional, and genuine."
good,"Enjoyed every part of it, little disappointed with the employees always looking for short cuts, deleting peoples order just to get out of work early  besides that great place to work... "
good,"An experience of a life time watching a new operation grow. During my time with the firm we came together to fight through so real challenges (Southern California Grocery-Chain Strike) for the smaller location. Once used as the testing facility by the corporate. We proved that we could do more with less labor if we had the right planning behind it. Once a 10 million dollar monthly sales operation six years ago, I am sure it has increased since then with new facility and greater capacity."
good,"I don’t have much bad to say about this place, they have great discounts, and benefits. They pay really good and offer a generous PTO package. My manager was really understanding the problem came with anyone higher up."
good,Order processing and customer service call center. A great team environment with competitive pay and excellent benefits. flexible hours and room for advancement.
good,"Work there but don't mess up. Paid breaks but punch out for lunch.Wear light steal toe shoes, don't breathe in all the dust if possible. Show up on time and don't eat other peoples food in the break room."
good,Environnement de travail est très agréable. Belle équipe avec qui j'adore travailler!
good,Working on UNFI is always been appreciated because of growing culture and adaptability of new technologies and I found peers very marvelous helpful and always found productive.
good,"Extremely enjoy my career at UNFI. Unfortunately, the finance department is relocating to over 2 hours away. Would love to continue my career at this company but really looking to continue my career in finance/ accounting."
good,They are very strict with policies but have a good natured environment. Plenty if not excessive amount of hours that when you put in for a long period of time you may develop back pain (As I did). Doesn't give you much time with family or friends due to overtime and hours can range from 10am-11am to whenever at night. I've worked all the way up to midnight some nights because you go until you get the job done. Hours are unpredictable so overtime can be one day and normal if not less the next so you never get full amount of overtime hours in that you actually acquired some days. Managers were great while I was there but they were just starting to change management when I left so I don't know if it is any different now. Hopefully not. Benefits are great as well and helps feed the family and pay bills.
good,"Work with functional areas to assist in process improvements. I work with my team and functional department to identify process and reporting improvements."
good,My days at UNFI were usually 9 to 10 hours long. Everything was organized and the production was well. The people I worked with taught me how to work in there and how I could get better if I just tried. The hardest part of the job was trying to deal with out of stocks. The out of stocks would slow me down and kill some of my rate. The most enjoyable part of my job was bonding with the people around me. That helped build motivation for me when ever the day was just not right.
good,I enjoy working for this employer because of their commitment to the sustainability of our planet and the communities in which they operate.
good,"Great job, friendly folks, fun to be around with."
good,Every one was treated with the upmost respect and treated very fairly.  The benefits are amazing and management was very willing to coach for advancement.
good,Company was very good to employees. The salary was very good and above the average.  It was a very fast paced environment and one had to deal with a variety of store personell.
good,"Paid by the hour, good over time, great management. Can get really busy during the holidays. I liked the management, always helping you when there a heavy day."
good,"this is a very busy and fast pace work place, 10 hour days plus overtime. i enjoyed being busy and always having things to do."
good,"This company really takes good care of their employees. From your first day of work, the management team helps their employees be the best at their job while providing them with the best benefits and other programs that they have. They make work fun and made everyday at work a good day. they are very positive."
good,"New management team has reinvigorated the business. The company believes in family and workplace balance. Customer loyalty can change in a flash. Finding new products to sell can be enjoyable and often hard if it is to replace the sales of a larger one you are losing."
good,it was a good company but they had two different companys hiring for them and I was with the temp agency and was let go after three months and I was unable to apply for pinnacle to be directy hired because I work for the temp company that was not good other then that loved the work and most of the management
good,"I loved my position, I handled two of the biggest accounts which include all HawaII Accounts, and the biggest food chain, Whole Foods Market. I enjoyed working with each and every accounts on a daily basis, formed good relationships and communication. Every day was a new day, a new challenge."
good,Everything was well set up but not organized. I would say my review for them will sit at a 6 maybe even a 5 due to management on partial credit on their behalf.
good,I really enjoyed working there even though HR employees are not very respectful the management team was awesome and so were the coworkers. Long hours but they pay is well
good,a hard place to make production no supervisor with job experience
good,Good job just long hours but always get 3 days off a week. Coworkers and bosses are the best ive had ever. Also has good benefits for you and family. Ive been here a little more than a year and pay is commensurate with your time and experience.
good,estoy buscando trabajo y me an hablado de que es bueno trabajar en la unfi
good,"The job itself is not hard, but it could use more people who actually care about what's going on. And are more aware why people aren't enjoying the job. You can tell your manager a million times the same issue and it's resolved for that day but it arises the next week."
good,environnement tres saint pour le boulot et tres securisant
good,The best job Ive ever had. Great pay and great benefits. The hours were extremely long but it was no big deal for me. I appreciated the overtime and big paychecks
good,again the only reason i am riting here is because i am being forced to before i can continue along with this process. i really need to find a job please help.
good,UNFI is a good company to work for.  Sometimes there is not enough hours.  Other times there is more than enough.  Very honest and dependable company.  Enjoy working here.
good,"i liked the company , i really didn't like the way the was always having me work in a warm climate and also in a cold climate , all day..i got really sick ."
good,It was  a great opportunity working at UNFI as machine operator 2nd shift. I learned a lot from the warehouse and also I contribute meaningfully towards the attainment of the company profit
good,"UNFI is a great place to work and is currently leading the way on how customers can get all natural and organic foods from the farm to the table."
good,Great job that really cares about the associates and the environment.
good,It was a great company overall but I had to relocate to be with family
good,"stocking freight, managing multi accounts, customer service , scheduling checking dates, .You work alone managing your accounts may have several a day. ordering product , you stay very much in connection with stores managers always"
good,its a job if you like fast pace. learing new jobs every day. a good job to move up in. Making a lot of co workers from different countrys
good,"Supply Management located in Rocklin, CA."
good,"i like this place.  great employees, nice tractors and trailer.  I only looking for another job because there building a new DC in the bay area"
good,"I really enjoyed this job ,i learned selecting product from different departments like chill ,dry,repack  and frozen and knowing all departments to be able to locate product in case of missing product and sending the right product to the costumer .,The hard part of the job was management i did not like it at all, changing the people all the time even human resources  my co-workers and i just doing our jobs trying to manage the changes that always affected us by changing  rules and the system ."
good,I loved my job. Very easy.Management was not in the same town so I didn't see them much.Very nice and helpful. We always had to get on group meeting's once a week. The hardest part of this job ( but not really) was traveling two hour's away and driving back the same day.
good,"My typical day at work is just going to work making UNFI a better company to work for, I learned how to be more business like how to cop with other people, when i was there management was very very poor if management did what they suppose to i probably would still be there, they tried to over work their workers, i enjoyed work, hours, pay, and the gathering they have at the end of the year."
good,I enjoyed my time at UNFI. This job was very competitive but everybody was friendly to eachother. This job will make you feel comfortable but after awhile things get very hard.
good,"Good jobs with great benefits, management is somewhat clickish. Best part of the job is customers and advancement within."
good,have to work on the hours better and do make there employees work over the hours that they was told to work . love to be in the mix of unfi company because it helped me understand more about what was needed to better me in the future.
good,UNFI is an okay place to work. They do not pay what the employees are worth. They also need to give Holidays off. Need to provide better benefits.
good,A productive day everyday in repack. Some early day and late nights.
good,All days would have different orders so everyday you would see how many people you would need to finish job in a timely matter.people would then be moved to places needed.there are always some people capable of doing more so they would be moved to areas most needed.I learned that people do a much better job when working together and it is much more enjoyable for them when you set goals they can reach.Management needs to be able to trust in workers and supervisors..As you get to know your coworkers you can better understand their point of view on things and you always need to listen to them before you make your choice as a supervisor. The hardest part of the job is making certain choices as you know you are the one taking responsibility for your actions and the actions of others.Of course the most enjoyable part of the day is when people work together and everything else just falls into place.
good,"UNFI is a great company, Small things really need to be changed but over all very good.  People are very friendly and good to you.  They have company events that keep you going"
good,I just want to start by saying that I loved my job. It was unfortunate that business goes the way business goes and jobs become relocated. This is a wonderful company to work for with advancements available to those who wish to improve themselves.
good,UNFI is a great place to work. I was able to learn new skills and work in a different environment than I was typically used to. I would not hesitate to work there again.
good,UNFI is fast pace and you are always learning. Management's doors are always open to voice your opinion and assist when escalations are needed. UNFI is like family
good,"Working at UNFI has been one of the greatest jobs that I have worked at. Yes, we work some long hours, but with a positive attitude the day goes by fast and the hours don't turn out to be long. Everyone works together to finish the orders that are to be selected. There is lots of bending and lifting. Great place to get a workout in! Management works hard to provide a safe and friendly work environment. They also supply food and drinks for us if and when we have long days/nights. they tell us how much they appreciate all our hard work and dedication to our job. UNFI employees work together as a team!"
good,"UNFI is a fun and relaxed workplace.  They have good benefits and the people are very friendly.  Unfortunately, they are moving a lot of the job back east so job stability is unsure for the future.  Love my job and what I do.  I enjoy talking and working with people."
good,"Very fast paced with a lot of physical activity. Fun coworkers to talk with and make my day go by fast,  The job requires a lot of moving around. I get my daily exercise from work."
good,Unfi is a great company to work for. Good wages good medical. but management is not always helpful with knowing what's going on. Sometimes they worry about stuff that doesn't need to have their attention
good,A typical day at work is to go to work on time. I learn how to be a better selector and to help costumers when they are confused about something. the best part about working here are the lunch breaks so that I am able to get to know my co-workers better.
good,while I was there I was able to get into work and work hard like everything there and kept a great pace. the work place is a great company to work for.
good,I absolutely loved working at unfi. It is a great company to work for. It just sucked that i had to move to Florida with my grandfather. I would love the chance to work there again
good,although you have to stay constantly moving the people were encouraging. overall the place was a good environment with excellent trainging. The pay was balanced with work ethic
good,"A typical day starts in the afternoon. Most runs are overnight driving. Start time can vary, 1pm-6pm. Routes travel the entire state of Florida. Most of the physical part is operating a electric pallet jack."
good,lots of new people and new opening of a company lots of hiccups. some management wanted to run the business in their own way.
good,"When I start my shift at work, I put on my headset to prepare to select items for the orders of the day. I work for an organic food distributer and  I've learned that there are so many different organic products that actually taste good. I know that through consistancy and hard work that anybody who desires can be a part of the management team. My co-workers are hard workers and loyal, but the hardest part of my job is the long hours of work, but after the work is done, I get a rush. Just knowing I helped the team the best way I could."
good,Check everyday to assure stores deliveries on time and service Reps scheduled to service accounts.
good,"Since moving shifts, there is not much I can comment on. While I was on a day shift, the environment was nice but challenging, though sometimes management did not always have an open ear to our needs (ie a schedule change or being flexible with schedules)."
good,Management was exceptional.  Great environment.  Learned a lot during my time there.  Wish it wasn’t contracted so I could have stayed!  Excellent work/life balance.
good,No family life. but over all a good place to work if you dont have kids manigment will work with you benefits after 30 days and a friendly work place.
good,"A typical work day was very busy from start of shift to end of shift. I learned vendors/ clients are vital to your company and how to deliver quality service. Management was nice and friendly. The hardest part of the job for me was walking through the cold cooler, and the most enjoyable part of the job was teamplayer."
good,"Was a company in transition.  Once SUPERVALU was purchased by UNFI, the goal was to eliminate all retail and return to the roots of wholesale."
good,"A typical day was waking up early going in to work and make these hours, heading to Long Island,Queens,Brooklyn, Manhattan and the Bronx, management pretty good"
good,"I loved working for UNFI, good pay, excellent benefits. Staff cares about each other. Annual work picnics, with gifts for children and well as employees."
good,Great place to work if you like hard work that keeps you moving all day.  There is an incentive available that you can work towards.  There is a break every 2.5- 3 hours of work.  The benefits are great and very affordable.  They even pay you to volunteer!  Management is very hands on and willing to help where needed.  I haven't had a job that you pick orders along side your boss.  Some days get long but they aren't all the time.  I would have stayed but I relocated for my wife's job.
good,"Started with shift work, 4 days at 12 hours. Worked hard and was promoted to M-F 8-5 shift. Advancement was achievable but required  120% of your physical being. Thought about and dealt with work more then anything else in life, work like balance severely tilted in the negative. Good co-workers, management fair. Was with company 5+ years gave the chance to learn a lot about the corporate life and how to cope."
good,I loved my job but did not work well with Management in the Customer Service Department
good,"I'm a selector, and I've just reached my 90 days yesterday. Contrary to popular belief, UNFI is a company that actually cares for its employees, as it preaches safety to us everyday and has several family-friendly events for its employees to partake in throughout the year."
good,Hours keep changing tough for family life I liked working here just can’t do the hours anymore and need to look for another job. Lots of good people work there
good,"They really seam to care about there employees. Was in contact with my boss even though he was in Rhode Island, he was great to work with. He cared enough to get to know you and then your family, wanted you to have a family life as well as a work life."
good,"I'm a current order selector at the Ridgefield DC. I've been here for almost 4 months, mostly selecting in dry grocery, more recently ive been picking in chill. I will start by saying that if this is your first real warehouse job, like it was for me (i came from a sedentary driving job as self employed no benefits), you won't find much better in this area in terms of pay, benefits, not being in a union (which is great imo). "
good,Pay was good for learning a new job. I learned alot loved the atmosphere driver's were awsome. I miss them would not have left if i didn't get called back. Benefits were good also
good,"Just go in with frame of mind to work, great company to work for, good benefits management crew is very helpful, only reason I didn't succeed,  I had personal issues I was dealing with that caused me to point out, which is a good system, if given another chance I know I will succeed, overall this is a great company."
good,"If you like to make money, this is the right place to work. "
good,awesome absolutely nothing to say about this job it was cool and I enjoyed working there. staff were friendly and knowledgeable
good,This job has taught me the value of teamwork.  I have always been the type of person to pitch in whenever needed.  It is wonderful to work with people who share the same values.
good,UNFI is a very large company with a dynamic range of job opportunities. The only problem with the job I had was the lack of training. I learned a lot about sales and my responsibilities through other sales people in the company.
good,Very professional upbeat leadership team is always in touch to guide the days production
good,"very good company, great benefits and co workers. involvement with community service also a highlight."
good,My day consisted of many things which can be seen in my resume that I posted
good,"Fortune 500 company, it's a good company to work for. Good place to work. Good benefits, retirement package."
good,"Considering that i read 75% of the reviews on here about the order selecting job at UNFI before i got hired i wasnt sure what i got myself into. The top complaints and bad reviews were mostly no family life or bad management. As a young single man (im 28) and my previous job being in a rental/construction company this was only easy for me while the starting pay is so much better at UNFI. Of course you wont have lots of family time but thats in ANY hard working job. The positives about this job and ive only been here for 2 weeks is that theres only 4 days out of the week where you have to work with the other 3 days off and volunteered overtime. They stress to you when you first start that this is a physical job, and always stretch before your shift, but for me being 5'11 140 pounds this was extremely easy while all i did was ride around on a electronic pallet jack and stack up pallets with boxes weighing no more than 30-40 pounds, 70% of the boxes your stacking are less than 15 pounds. Yes ive read the reviews on this site where people say this is a physical and tough job but its not as long as your not lazy, time flies on a 10 hour shift when you/re constantly busy. My location in Iowa is super friendly management wise and the training is very specific and assertive, if you dont get it you just dont get it, its not for everyone. "
good,People are very nice. Management very nice and HR are very nice people. Start time is at 9 am which is great. Two paid for 15 minute breaks. Great pay. Very close to home. The hardest part of job is getting use to stacking product but management gives you plenty of time to learn how to stack and learn the location of product. Unfi uses vocollect and stickers to locate the product and use for a map
good,"Operating a reach truck to do replenishments in the freezer department. I also loaded and unloaded (inbound, outbound) trucks. I also kept records of inventory. In charge of maintaining a safe and clean work enviormment."
good,Its a great place to work period. Management have issues some time but everything eventually work itself out. New trucks and the upkeep on them is great.
good,UNFI is not for the people who dont want to work.  you have to meet your numbers if you want to grow.  Biggest problem is the other employees who are lazy.
good,Mgt have two much favoritism either they love u or they hate u sometimes they say things to cover there own butts when there in the wrong they Dont know how to communicate to employees an rude they act like there job is more im important than yours ive experiment this for myself they also have a high turn over with starting acociat we loose people like flys they keep the invirment we work in messy an we have maitence people i dont get it yeah i woul not recommend any one i know not an less there  desperate i dont. Hate the place or its people but they have some things to wrk on they allow selctor 2drop paper all over the floor no repocution its crazy.
good,"A lot of longevity at UNFI, great pay and benefits. The company has grown so that we now carry the Whole Foods brands and as recently took ownership of Supervauel Foods."
good,"A typical day at work would be to meet with the previous shift management. Next, I would perform a start up meeting for the next shift employees.Then, I would project completion time for the amount of work. Last, I would monitor the shift and make sure all safety rules are followed, and would complete observations on employees."
good,"I love working for UNFI. Great company, great customers, great employees. There is opportunities if you are looking for them. I like the variety and that you're not stuck doing the same thing day in and day out. You can change your runs every year or you can float without a regular schedule."
good,Same day by day operations. Helpful co workers. Every department has a different work environment. Quiet place to work. Job in tails you to really learn a lot of aspects of the job on your own with trial and error.
good,"fast paced inviorment"
good,I enjoyed working for UNFI. The trainers work with you to help you work at a faster pace its was competitive. The UNFI Company treat there employees like family we work as a team.
good,"I loved working at UNFI and would go back if I had the opportunity. My manager was not the best manager, but the other managers were great. People work together to get the job done."
good,"I loved it here, great people, great atmosphere. Really great company with great health benefits. I miss it here. I encourage others to apply immediatly."
good,Good company to work for. Has Flexible hours and they do treat you like family . something that a lot of big company's forget to do now a days . I would recommend this place to anyone.
good,"if you are willing to work it is a great job that will keep you busy there is no layoffs the benefits are very good ,it is a family oriented company and the employees are also great"
good,"It's a positive place to work and grow a career, I would recommend a friend to apply. A typical day involved dealing with inventory checks and updating required reports and portfolios. Checking to make sure safety standards are met, products are in order and account for losses and damages. I learnt a lot about machinery usage and management was never a bother. I would definitely work for the company again, I had to move and they had no branch or subsidiary at my location."
good,"This was a great job M-F full time. I liked that I was always in the same place most of the time. The management in the store was easy to get along with. My direct supervisor from UNFI was not a great person, fortunately I didn't have to deal with him often. The reason I left was because Haggen cancelled their contract with UNFI, so we were all let go. I couldn't go to work at the warehouse because they were in Auburn. That was to far for me to drive daily."
good,Management holds each worker accountable for what is expected of them.  Some days get long but you are only required to work 4 days a week and everyone gets Saturday off. Everyone is enjoyable to work with and everyone creates a fun atmosphere.   I would recommend this company to others.
good,"At UNFI I help the associates in all aspects of HR. I handled matters with attendance, leaves of absences, workers compensation, investigations,  employee relations, employee recognition, etc. I worked with the managers and associates in the Transportation, Safety, Inventory Control, and Maintenance teams. It was a challenging and fast pace environment, with great opportunity for growth and training."

good,"Put truck ordered up, blocked shelves, ordered truck for following week, issue credit for damaged, out of dates. Work end caps or display shippers. Look for incremental sales. reset shelves with planograms, work new items to shelves. You pretty much own the job. Management did help out where needed, good support from management. Mostly worked by ourselves. Toughest part of job was keeping up with credits. Enjoyed working with employees of stores i serviced. Building relationships, working with management. Company took pretty good care of us. When things were slow, they made adjustments to help us. I have to say that it was a great expereince, and i enjoyed working for them."

The most enjoyable part of the job was the people. From the customers I delivered to to the warehouse to the office people all great.
good,"I absolutely loved working for unfi i would definitely work there again if i could fine one local. the Job was great the pay was great and the management and people were also great. the only downfall I would say was scheduling. at the time i was a student so I was only able to work a first shift. But every Three weeks everyone's schedule would rotate and for myself, residing in Providence, RI did not help with the commute to Dayville, CT as the result my car ended up breaking down and I was unable to continue my contract with UNFI and JVT advisers"
good,I loved working at UNFI. Starting pay was great and training was straightforward. They give you 6 weeks to practice and get used to working orders and start making your rates. Its very fast paced and it can be a lot of physical labor but if you don't ind the work out then i would recommend this job.

good,"Good place to work"
good,Each warehouse shift starts out with stretches and the game plan of the day as well as up coming meetings and events. The workload sometimes seems overwhelming but the employees are team players and alway get it done together! The management team has an open door policy and will always be there to address the issues at hand fairly. UNFI have a very diversified culture that all blends together beautifully. The hardest part of the job is keeping enough coffee cups in the free coffee vending machine!!! The best part of the job is at the end of the day when you know everyone pitched in to do the awesome job we do each and everyday!!!
good,shuttle driver daily routine. 370 miles per day. learn how to get the job done in any type of weather. management is always aware of problems and finds solutions to fix them. work place culture is great. hardest part is being loaded on time. the most enjoyable part is that you get to meet and greet all types of people and get to visit places you never been.

good,"I worked for Albert's Organics which is owned and operated by UNFI and I can say in all honesty that this is a top notch organization and the best job I've ever had. Excellent benefits and pay, tuition reimbursement, 401k, but you have to be a hard worker, slouches need not apply. I was let go when they bought the company I was originally hired by, Global Organics. My background check didn't measure up because I'd been arrested more than once. I was never late and never missed a day and was a top selector. That's the only negative I have to say about the company is that they couldn't see that I worked hard to redeem myself and overcome my past. I felt like I was just a number to them. Make no mistake though, I will do everything I can to get my job back and prove them wrong. It's not the management or HR that fired me, it was a board that voted me out. Another negative, very corporate, not the family type atmosphere most people enjoy."
good,"My experience with UNFI was a very positive one. I started with the company in its earlier beginnings and through hard work and dedication; was able to grow and advance along with the company from the lowest entry level position to a supervisory management position. I worked with a lot of great people in a good teamwork atmosphere. I cared and supported the people I worked with and in turn; felt that I was cared for and supported as well. I believed in the Company's culture on the environment, whole foods and organics and there philanthropic ways such as donating to local food banks. I actually felt that I worked for a great place that did good things and also cared about its employees. The work can be tedious at times, with timelines to meet and detail and production oriented, but the opportunities are there if you seek them and work for them, the rewards can be great."
good,"Long days, Long hours, Hard non-stop working and moving around"
good,I always go work happy if something goes wrong we fix it together working in a warehouse is a team afford we all give 100% or more ever day
