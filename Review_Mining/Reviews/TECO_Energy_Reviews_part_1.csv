bad,"Being a temporary agent was extremely stressful. I worked at the ybor city location. They make you work overtime. They will hire a temporary class after you and they get to get off work before you. You have to report to zero chaos . They lie and say your doctors appointments or any other important appointments are approved and they're actually not . They show favoritism, a lot of drama , and everyone talking mess about each other. The ladies in zero chaos show favoritism. Just horrible I could go on and on . I wouldn't recommend this comapny at all."
bad,"I did not like culture and management at this company. Very stressful environment. They have not set proper guideline. staff is not co-operative at this place,"
bad,"Unless you are one of the good ole boys you probably won't do well at this company. There are too many people there that have hidden agendas, and would stab you in the back to advance their own career. Now that TECO has been bought by another company I don't see any change in the attitudes there or how things are done."

good,"Laid back atmosphere but with a sense of urgency. Learned that the work environment is not the same as life environment, must learn to adapt. My personal coach was great, very understanding and knowledgeable. Co-workers friendly and willing to lend a hand. Hardest part of my job was to balance all different learning skills and personalities in a training class for 8 to 10 weeks at a time while keeping to the material. Most enjoyable was meeting new people and help them work towards achieving there career goals."
