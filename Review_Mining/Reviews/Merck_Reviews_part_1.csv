bad,"A la tête du client....car gros manque de respect., certains responsables ce la jouent...  sont montés en grade on se demande comment, quand un problème ce présente devant eux  et doivent prendre des décisions....ils ne sont plus là....Belle dignité..., pitoyable."
bad,"Good pay terrible politics and bad culture "
bad,"Horrible nightmare experience. work like a slave with no human considerations or freedoms. you make a couple of mistakes and they fire you.  No support from cold, remote staff and no paid sick days and no paid vacation time."
bad,"Do not work there, its a revolving door and you have to look over your shoulder to make sure you do not get fired. They make you face a wall, and they micromange your life to the point that your body will break down from the stress while they tell you when to breathe or not."
bad,"Never offered a permanent position. The pay is 1/3 less, no bonus, time off, vacation or benefits, and no respect. Lots of overtime without pay. The cell line development group is run by all Chinese immigrants who favor permantly hiring Chinese immigrants. They do not have reasoning skills and work you hard, not smart. I don’t know how one of the directors keeps her job she is so awful. She physically attacked someone who is afraid to report it."
bad,"Not a place for humans. Zero culture. A horrible place to work, horrible management. Environment disgusting. Dirty, overcrowded. No respect for the employee, Similar to the slave quarters on an ancient Roman galley."
bad,This company cares nothing about career growth. Plan to at least 10 years in a position. Most areas are extremely over worked. The culture of the company is very poor.
bad,"These people are a bunch of clowns.  I was working with On Board Companies for a contract position in Clinical Packaging.  After being investigated for a position I had interviewed with and accepted, the position was abruptly cancelled.  I had to send 3 years tax information, and took 2 drug tests.  I have nothing questionable in my back round."
bad,Company laid off workers when it acquired Schering Plough.  Many legacy sales representatives were downsized and given a severance.  Did not have an opportunity to re-interview.
bad,"One of the best pharmaceutical companies I have been working so far. Very good group people, friend environment, and work balance.  A good place to work for.."
bad,buena empresa para laborar con buenos principios  y excelente oportunidad de crecimiento
bad,"Abismal company health and safety non existent,  cowboy attitude towards people and they are not animal component free , they have a attitude of disposable workers"
bad,"Please do not go for this. They will make sure you quite your actual job and get you in by offering you a higher pay. But trust me , after you are in for no reason other than we don't like your personality.  After two months the HR will call you during your day off telling you that you are terminated. They don't have HR  at the  Elkhorn Nebraska plant . They have only one traveling HR and you will never have a chance to see her after your first day at work. Uneducated operation manager with an expired boiler license . Low moral. Bad manager with unethical behavior. They don't have any knowledge in Automation technology and Plc and they got frustrated because I am showing them the automation. If you don't believe me go for it because you will find out the hard way. They will not going to keep you."
bad,No room for advancement. Manager play favorites and moves up people who they like and not because of experience. I generally would not recommend working here unless you really need a job.
bad,"Merck absolutely SUCKS!  Crazy people work there!  My supervisor was absolutely irrational and crazy!  Everyone walked around in a Psychotically Paranoid State in the fear of losing their job, it's downright pitiful!"
bad,The turn over rate is high. The management is horrible. This place is great for getting the experience you need to get a better job. I would recommend staying here for 2yrs and move on.
bad,Worked very long  hours. The manager was very disrespectful. I felt s though I were a lave in a lab coat. We do not treat people as scientists as the way that Merck  treats their scientist.
bad,Workplace culture is awful. There is no loyalty towards current employees. They would rather hire from outside than train and advance from within. Management looks out for themselves.
bad,Corporate culture at this place will have everyone against you in less than 60 seconds. All it took was one vet of the lab to take a dislike to me and I was out of my contract for the first minor discrepancy they could come up with.
bad,Manager Micro-manage seasoned workers  . Performance reviews are not done until the last moment and doesn't give you a opportunity to correct .I had 4 managers in three years .
bad,"The pace was extremely fast and stressful. If you did something wrong  two lead employees would come and get you and march you into the supervisors office, much like a gestapo."
bad,if you make it through a day there with out a heart attack you were lucky horrible place to work harrish pressure to survive eggos run crazy screw your co-works and you may make it a year or two.
bad,"Constant fear of lay-offs, people stepping on you to reach their goals, minimum training, cold environment, work calls while on vacation, expected to work long hours"
bad,I HATE Merck!!!  Beware...  They promise all this career advancement and really you get no where that's why I had to leave.  Also they are very particular.  Everyone has left Merck even management if that tells you anything.
bad,The people I worked with was very high maintenance and one of the administrative assistant acted like a total stupid person. Very arrogant and rude. My manager was very picky and rude.
bad,"Long time at Schering Plough-21 Years"
bad,Merck Animal health in Elkhart Nebraska was the worst company I had ever worked for. They treat animals better than their people. Managers micro manage to the point you cannot get work done. Management holds your vacation hostage because employees just quit and walk out due to poor environment. The organization promotes individuals who are computer illeterate and have zero management or people skills. The Human Resorce department helps management coverup activity that is illeagal under OSHA. Do yourself a favor and avoid this organization at all costs.
bad,"Would I go back and work for these lowlifes? Not a chance. It was once a great company, but is now among the most corrupt companies in the world, top to bottom. They will put on the dog-and-pony show about how honest they are, but behind the scenes it's all about the money. Either you play ball and do as you're told---no matter how amoral---or you're targeted for deletion. Don't join this organization under any circumstances."
bad,"The immediate director is over controlling"
bad,"very tough time in industry."
bad,"Owner is a great guy with a great vision. Unfortunately the management in place are not motivated or skilled at managing, training, or even communicating effectively with staff."
bad,"•a typical day at work"
bad,They keep their employees in the dark.  Managers are not qualified to do their jobs.  Not a good company to work for.
bad,answered phone problems no review - at this time.  Was separated from the company
bad,Merck is a great company to work for. It is a great place to learn and grow.  
bad,"Slave driving team leads, they lay off ever so often. Terrible work environment, always felt cramped."
bad,"Company is not a healthy athmosphere, management does not promote a good work enviroment."
bad,Very stressful environment and bad management involve.
bad,"Overall the company is good for someone who doesn't want to challenge the self. There is no new innovation, 60% workforce are contractors and they are there to maintain the environment. Prepare to play corporate politics!"
bad,"You face a wall every day, you are constantly watched and observed all the time. They make you get projects done with unreasonable time limits while you cannot provide any ideas or commentary as to how to improve the process. You are surrounded by a lot of pigs and racist people."
bad,"Me ofrecieron una posición que no existe dentro de la estructura de la empresa."
bad,"Upper Management turns a blind eye to all that occurs within their control as they do not want to be held responsible for their Lower Level Management. "
bad,"Merck is the kingdom of  low morale, fear and paranoia. The higher management seems to promote it. People are assigned so much work to do they can barely cope with it. There so much ""back stabbing"", you cannot call it competition anymore. The most enjoyable part of the job is lunch and when you leave the site. Period."
bad,"despues de haberle servido por varios años, vendieron y nos negaron el derecho a una liquidacion e indemnizacion traicionando con palabras la confianza y la honestidad."
bad,"Worked here as a temp. Lots of fighting,arguing and just overall combative people in my department. If you were not apart of the elite “clique” you were a nobody. As a temp you were treated as a second class citizen. If you were a “favorite” of the boss and you are a temp you had a better shot at getting a full time position here. Some of the people are great to work with and did not partake in the childish games that were played. Would never and will never recommend this place to anyone. On the positive side I learned a lot about animal vaccines and seen how they were made."
bad,"Slave Labor and no off time whatsoever.  Threats of being fired if hint of wanting or needing time off.  Horrible hostile working conditions.  Policies, procedures, rules change on a whim."
bad,"They hired 170 in one week for 2 manager.   I never even talked to my manager, he didn't have the time.  While contract workers are often not treated well, it was especially bad at Merck."
bad,This company preaches safety yet they will not give you breaks stating that by law they don't have to. I am constantly dehydrated and afraid to drink anything before or during work because I will not be allowed to use the restroom. How a pharmacutical company treats their employees like this and is still in business is beyond me. Management will micro manage you to death and stab you in the back if you don't dance like a puppet. Shifts have leads that chanllenge each other on who can do the least amount of work. If you value a company that treats you like a human than stay well clear of this facility.
bad,"Lots wrong with this company.  Management, pipeline, consistency, leadership, closed to improvements or optimization.  Lots of politics, only the divisive and underhanded make it while trashing their team members and direct reports."
bad,"Management is very poor at Merck, always looking for ways to screw the hourly (Union) workforce."
bad,Management sucks here in all areas For sure you won't grow here and if your a Temp good luck...you'll be there for 2+ years before they let you go..oh did i mentioned HR and Management suck here..
bad,"Management at this facility is very racist. They do not like people of color, specially if someone comes a foreign country. They are very bias. They do not have no respect for African/American"
bad,Too many negative experiences to type. Made the most of the experience and learned many life lessons. Learned many aspects of pharmaceutical manufacturing through persistence and hard work.
bad,"Management = 0"
bad,My direct supervisor was new to her position and obviously overwhelmed and there was only a team of about ten people.  They had 32 OOS's that hadn't even been investigated.
bad,"Management has no clue how to manage. The Durham site is top heavy with workers that know absolutely nothing about how to perform their jobs. Diversity is the sites worst enemy. Start hiring people for their job skills, not because of the color of their skin. Micromanaging is the norm. Bonuses are used to punish employees that the coach does not like. Short cuts are taken, mistakes are covered up. When the FDA is on site, you are not allowed to talk to them."
bad,"Once you hit 48, your chances of getting a pension are very slim.   So my advice ask for a great deal of money before you sign-on.  And save for a rainy day."
bad,Beneficios sociales como comedor y parking. Poco equilibrio vida privada /laboral al trabajarse fines de semana y festivos. Salario adecuado. Trabajo fácil pero repetitivo.
bad,"I spend 5 days a week calling on physicians and medical staff to promote and support Merck vaccines."
bad,"İşyerinde çalışma saatleri elverişlidir, işe ne zaman gelip gideceğiniz bellidir."
bad,"I was an IT contractor here for eDiscovery, and they treated us all like chopped liver.  The director (no longer there) was completely uncivilized.  Only plus was work was done at 5.   I hear the benefits are good for FT employees, and they get treated much, much better.  I'm sure that MDs / PhDs in the various research teams, and who are full time employees may have a very different experience than I did."
bad,"Unfortunately, working for a union allows employees to act very unprofessionally. The training was rushed and if an employee did not feel like training, which was very often, then they have you follow them and honestly give no verbal training, or they just leave you in the breakroom all night.  This happened to me multiple times. I told the union and the company management about this and nothing was resolved. Mangement was scared to receive any negativity from the union employees and thus, did not resolve any issues I had."
bad,"Merck has an actual target to advance women in the workplace.  Consequently, forget about advancement if you're not female.  Typical female catty-ness ensues now throughout Merck (which includes screaming matches in meetings [literally]).  Also, they don't even promote based on most qualified for the job.  It's typical Merck:  ""Poor execution of an arbitrary target.""  Granted, the target (women in science) is a noble goal; however, acceptable execution has never been Merck's strong suit."
bad,No primary care future in tablet pharma sales.  Constant layoffs looming. They do not promote from within.  You are not allowed to apply for positions in different departments.
bad,"Management was not professional, I raised some concerns about his behavior and communication towards me and I was removed from Merck' account because i reported unethical treatment. I was expected to work in a hostilee and disrespectful environment ."
bad,"Entreprise à éviter. "
bad,"Great compay to learn about big pharma very scientific driven. Working with pods.Company car, laptop benefits are great with the bonus given at the end of the year. Pay has changed to bi-weekly"
bad,"i had a terrible experience working at little caesars. The manager would cancel my work for the day, but waited untill i drove all the way there to tell me to go home. Most of my co-workers were fun to work with. However i had a terrible manager, and the owner would constantly yell at employees. My manager was very unproffesional. He threw a cockroach at me."
bad,"I learned a lot about being lied to , back stabbed, and harassed, and lied about! I did learn a lot about different forms of chemical production Whenever i was bragged about by a supervisor to management i got moved off of that job and shipped somewhere else. It was as if they did not want me to excel at anything, so i managed to learn all the jobs. The jobs themselves were not bad, there was no team at all, you could not be left alone to do your job! Supervision , and management were untrustworthy . You had to constantly check your equipment do to them screwing with it! The most enjoyable part was not being there!"
bad,Had to join the union and management hated the union very stressful where the management went out of their way to fire you at any instance and the union representation was poor
bad,A high paying company.  Many different divisions.  An interesting place to work but not for everyone.  I worked for a division which was being disbanded.
bad,"NUL employés embauché service kit pitoyable, mauvaise et néfaste.  Aucun respect ne supporte pas les intérimaires."
bad,Management here is the major problem it's almost like being in high school because of the certain people that management likes and they give promotions to.
bad,Under the first administration was the Best structure for the company as a whole. After it dispersed the company never rebounded and employees were devalued Greatly.
bad,"Lo que más rescato de mi experiencia en la empresa es la calidad de las personas que ahí trabajan, son todas muy educadas y cordiales en el trato."
bad,"Revenues continue to drop year after year and management's only answer is to fire more people.  That is not a sustainable business plan.  The fat has been gone for years and the cuts keep coming.  Lots of ""gallows humor"" among workforce, everybody knows they don't have a future with the company.  It's a shame, it used to be a great company to work for, now the environment is just toxic."
bad,Merck has great benefits but the management are insensitive and are not engaged with the empoyees on the floor.
bad,I was a good work I came in with good experiences in shipping receiving but didn't get treated fairly. I wouldn't want to go back there if I had to because they only look out for people that they like.
bad,I really like working for Merch.  They treat their workers really good.  My position at Merch was temporary.  In 2 years I was able to learn a lot.  Is a happy place.
bad,Felt that the department I work for within Merck had low amount of work enthusiasm.  I and others were treated like a number rather then as people.  This caused the environment to be rather uncomfortable.
bad,Call center environment. Over worked on Mondays with no days off in a row. Over worked and underpayed. No incentive for movement within the company. Do your job and leave.
bad,Worst Company. No sponsorship and i hate to work there. The pressure is too much to work with and the clients are painful to deal with as they do not know the basic stuff of technology.
bad,"Contract work - inconsistent "
bad,"Removed employees without any notice. Giving such a short notice to come out of the company is weared."
bad,"Too much work for 1 person.  Low pay and very cheap.  I remember having to pay for a cup of hot water! Really???  On the positive side, the other contractors were very nice and we all got along which made the day go by faster."
bad,Part of a subsidiary which the top management do not pay much attention to as it is located south and have an annual low profit yield. Very bias management with limited opportunity for career growth.
bad,You will work under the threat of departure.  Unstable environment
bad,"Enjoyed most of my years here, especially while leading the Veterans Employee Business Resource Group and working in the Hospital Sales Division. Unfortunately, Oncology is the only viable option now."
bad,"buena libertad de accion , escaso seguimiento de consejos de experiencia, falta de rumbo"
bad,This company especially the Durham site need a serious reorganization. The Managers are not up to par. I do not understand the hiring criteria and probably never will.
bad,"The co-workers are all professionals and dedicated to accomplishing the needs of the Business."
bad,"Merck is in the throes of reorganization, restructuring, and downsizing. Since Merck ""merged"" with Schering-Plough, the company has eliminated many positions,departments, sites, functions, etc. The combined companies had 90+ global sites and will ultimately reduce that number by nearly 50%, and now also targets 50% external manufacturing solutions. "
bad,"Leadership is a serious issue in this company"
bad,"Will not recommend it to a friend,At all....the company only thinks of its self and not the employees at all....Alot of the employees said they would not take to medicine they produce."
bad,No me gusto nada trabajar en un lugar estresante y con mala vibra
bad,"If you're into politics, you would fit in perfect at Merck.  People are not promoted or given a chance based on work ethic but based on who they're friends with.  It is a ""good ol boys"" system and it is unfortunate because a lot of talented people are over-looked while others are promoted generously based on personal relationships with others."
bad,I didn't realize how miserable  I was until after I left. Union is destroying the company. Only matter of time when it closes up shop and moves to Durham NC.
bad,"Over the last several years the organization has become one of self preservation.  It is not the company it once was."
bad,If you have to choose between this job and another position and you or confused do not pick Merck.  If you like stressful days and working with evil people then go ahead but don't say I didn't warn you!!
bad,"Not a very pleased work place culture, the diverse employees are always humiliated and not counted in employee gatherings. The management is so weak and is mostly focused on micro managing instead of proficiency and innovations."
bad,No meds in facility but with all the security you would have thought there were all types of meds.  Facility was like working in a cave as the only light was in the front of te building. .
bad,Work-life balance is missing in the finance dept. Duplicity of work & reporting procedures. Individual Assessment process needs to be improved.
bad,company very mismanaged. Local management very poor as well as top management. Layoffs are rampant.  The company only has 3 three products they are promoting in their primary care bag and one is going generic next year. More layoffs are sure to come. The company treats the employees very badly. They lie to them constantly. Do not go to work there.
bad,"Management: Arrogance and personal gain in the guises of in the companies best interest. Poor hiring practices a lack of knowledge on production floor, favoritism and a general sense of contempt for employees, smug demeanor from CEO of main facility permeates through- out company. Misuse of funds, lack of fore site. Endangering public for the sake of sales numbers."
bad,"Typical day putting out fires and constantly troubleshooting. Can't get support from management or coworkers because everyone keeps leaving the company or taking a job in another department, or contractors coming and going. Lot of effort goes into projects that are abandoned on the fly."
bad,"Responsible for many aspects of the Regulatory Affairs team including submissions, publishing, project mangement, document management to name a few. "
bad,"Poor onboarding process."
bad,Merck has very bad management and they make you work late with very limited people. currently they are reducing employees and going thru 5-10% cuts global.
bad,"Merck is a company that has amazing people assets. During my time there I had the pleasure of working directly with some of the most brilliant minds in the pharmaceutical sector. "
bad,"Merck has never truly recovered from the loss of VIOXX.  Senior management has consistently managed the stock price instead of the company.  After decades of scorning big mergers and going to great lengths to prove that such fundamental changes in BigPharma almost always fail to satisfy expectations, Merck merged with Schering and became part of the data its management used to tout as a reason not to merge large research-based established.  Now, over four years post merger, Merck has still not completed its slash and burn approach to cost cutting.  The most important lesson learned at Merck is that you should never, ever believe that the company is somehow different from its competitors or has some sort of protection from market forces that rivals lack.  Based upon my contacts who have remained at the company, the atmosphere is as tense, anxious and paranoid as when I left."
bad,Company is focused on management from a Top down approach.
bad,"Salaire bas, impossible de négocié quoi que ce soit."
bad,worked in the union and it was terrible.  the management and union fight all the time and everyone on the new contract is underpaid. I wouldn't go back there as a union employee again.
bad,"Do you think is possible – that will all the money this company spends on meetings outside the corporate office’s it owns that just once…maybe just once you could leave a tip for the people who service you?? The people who get up so early in the morning to make sure your room is set right, breakfast is out, put lunch out - services your dinners on the company.... and we put up with you not knowing how to use a projector and all your other needs – maybe you could toss us a few bucks once and awhile and say thank you! You right it off anyway…..us servers in NJ and PA would appreciate it! and cash would be nice. Thank you!"
bad,This job showed me how ineffective leadership can break up good workers.  This place was morally a challenge to work at.  The bonus structure was unfairly used by managers to promote favorites.
bad,Executive leadership was clueless and out of touch. Strategy was flawed. Multiple products did not make it to market due to bad business decisions and or faulty clinical studies.
bad,Was a good company to work for benefits diminished. So many management positions and meetings nothing getting done many changes could be made to better products but too many cliques.
bad,"It was biggest mistake of my life. Annormous pressure of sales. Their is no rules for sales. Company needs only sales,how? You know. People do unethical sales"
bad,"Merck's view on how pay is distributed is quite unfair.  They do not fairly pay the people on the floor with the most responsibilities, but they overpay the people that attend the most meetings who make themselves ""visible""."
bad,Hierarchy poorly structured. Responsibility is bottom to top. High up has little work or responsibility. Easily throw subordinates under the bus. Work environment revolves around CYA.
bad,Si eres de los amigos del gerente puedes permanecer en la empresa.
bad,An ok place to work but very competitive work environment. Not enough opportunities for advancement. Provide free work shirts. Managers are tolerable.
bad,Unless you are hired on full time through the door...there is really no future at this company going in as an agency worker.
bad,"The work was self rewarding, most people were fun to work with, hardest part of the job was to get direction from upper management, rules were vague,  put line managers responsible to make upper management decisions.  This caused issues between with consistency between departments."
bad,Very stressful job situation with low employee morale. Little training was offered. Computer systems changed too often. Management showed little concern for employees.
bad,I enjoy my Job but most of the people there are streesed all day. It is not a good place to work.
bad,"Unstable working environment, causing low morale, much politics to be played."
bad,"Excellent company who strategized over the last ten years to maintain their lead in pharmaceuticals and vaccines but little seemed to work.  Worked in several areas where my management team developed huge productivity/performance improvements and within a couple years of leaving, these improvements not only did not continue but performance took a step backwards from when taking over.  It was very disappointing and not surprising considering the current outlook of the company.  It is my hope that they turn it around as it was such a great company."
bad,"If you like working for places that are short staffed and so they use you and cram as much of a workload onto you as possible then work here. No good benefits, there are a lot of cliques and favorites. Should have been more professional given their reputation."
bad,Most days you are required to be on the production floor for 11.5 hours of your 12 hour shift with a 30 minute lunch break that begins as soon as you gown out and dress in you street clothes. The site is all the way in the woods so any place that is open to eat is a 15-20 minute drive which eats up all of your time for a break.
bad,"The Wilson site has very immature workers that believes in cliques. Management is subpar and has been berated by foreign regulatory agencies because of their lack of knowledge. Every manager has a preferences but Merck Wilson has favorites. Favorites treat others crudely and the victim is an outcast. Look carefully at the job trend there. There is a brief period of hiring every year or so. This is not a big site. If you are outside the clique, you be be outside the gate permanently sooner than later! Great pay but not worth the hassle."
bad,"This was a great opportunity to learn hands -on. This would be a tough environment for prospective employees that are looking for extensive training and mentoring. Was a part of awesome research but did not get to see it through to the end because of reorganizations, mergers, and budget cuts."
bad,Could pay more money to temps and no need for a 03 they feel they run the place and think they mangers then start stuff wit temps and when temps respond and it ain't what they want to hear they get mad and try to get u fired
bad,Not ideal for African Americans at the Wilson NC site. Contractors are not given consideration for permanent openings. Merck expects at a minimum 2.5 years as a Contractor before hiring permanently. Nepotism and favoritism run rampant.
bad,"Empresa para quem é efetivado como Merck é otima e possui muitos benefícios, já os funcionários terceiros não possuem metade e são cobrados por resultados da mesma forma."
bad,Medco is no longer part of Merck. Not sure where the company went or what it became. It was a challenging IT organization with a lot of turnover and lack of direction
bad,Merck continues to keep managers that do not encourage a team atmosphere.   Instead they pit reps against each other and create animosity amongst the team.  You check off their box and put up with an intimidating manager or you leave.
bad,"The company had good benefits, health, dental, 401k, at the time good pension.  Overall the experience was a good one.  The products I carried were of good quality."
bad,"...only to re-hire them as consultants.  They treat consultants (temps) as cattle...they only hire permanent employees from within, using nepotism, reverse-racial bias and a ""not what you know but who you know"" practices.  Consultants are treated like dirt."
bad,"I did everything I was asked to advance and more, but even when I interviewed for a promotion, I was not selected. The management expects people to work many more hours and at odd times than they do. I was also expected to work most weekends and holidays."
bad,This is one of the companies that requires a lot of time to excel. The upper management is strict and we were seldom given adequate time for a true response.
bad,"Don't go there for contract work! You will not be seriously considered even there is a right-fit permanent opening. The permanent job is for for the people who already know them or have family members there.  "
bad,The company is very consumer and product driven. The work life balance is disproportionate with little compensation. Management is more about deadlines than employees. Priorities change week to week leading to chaos and fatigue employees. Little visibility to bench analysts about company wants and needs and current state.
bad,Overall a good company. Good people to work with. This company values it's customers.  This company believes in volunteering.
bad,"Company is disorganized and poorly managed in the IT finance"
bad,"The company is fine, although is going through lay-offs at this time, which does not make for a positive work environment."
bad,"Company became to big and to complex, made it hard to get anything done.  The company had to many rules and regulations above federal, state and local laws, sometimes more is not better."
bad,Popularity contest exist at Merck. Hard work and dedication does not seem to matter to management. Would not recommend
bad,"Micromanagement.  Extraordinary amount of process, paper work, reports and unreasonable expectations.  Short sighted management."
bad,"Obtuve habilidad dando resultados de ventas bajo  muy pesado trabajo administrativo y gran presion, ya hacia el trabajo de 3 personas"
bad,"As the Company is on a mission to reduce headcount and overhead, the atmosphere on a daily basis is unstable.  Employees react to situations to defend their position and will intentionally pull down others for their own success.  My last review incuded to blatant lies and Human Resources suggested I take it to the Ethics department."
bad,There is a great diversity of people that come from all around the world.
bad,"Everyday I was challenged in Merck. I was given projects and trained in on something different throughout the 6 months that I was working there. I learned an huge amount about the pharmaceutical industry that I never knew e.g. I learned exactly how the production area operated, I learned how to time- manage efficiently, I improved my communication skills and I also gained a huge amount of confidence. Management was great. I reported to my manager on a weekly basis to ensure I had enough work to do and that I was keeping up to date with my work. My co-workers were amazing. Everyone was so friendly and helpful no matter how busy they were. The hardest part of the job was my first day as I didn't know what to expect. The most enjoyable part of the job was the everyday work that I carried out and getting to meet new people."
bad,Still recovering from the merger with Schering Plough and the patent cliff.
bad,kort gewerkt voor dit bedrijf vanwege fusering en direct aansluitend reorganisatie.
bad,"Had many opportunities to advancements"
bad,I am working since 5years company job achived lanches new product and achived target as well as and take incentive mangers and national sales manger give coopeartion placement of product.activity of sevenseas group activity is very memouruble
bad,"Sales rep, to achieve the targets by prescription generation through the doctors in private market"
bad,Not a good place to advance in my opinion. Job is fairly simple but to redundant and monotonous at times. The pay is definitely not an incentive to grind your life away in a cubicle.
bad,A lot of learning opportunities to help develop your career path. They allow you to take upon different roles to diverse your learning and enhance what you have already learned. Great company!
bad,"Nothing else to add. Lots of cliques, lots of red tapping, lots of favoritism. They tell you that they want you to develop but won’t even let you work on projects that allow you to develop."
bad,"Merck Sharp & Dohme heeft voor mij geen fijne indruk achtergelaten."
bad,"It doesn't matter WHAT you know it matters WHO you know. "
bad,Union people were treated like trash. I did not have a good work relationship with my boss. He had no idea how to do the job. He was not a tradesman. He was just their for discipline.
bad,If you don't have a degree you can't go anywhere no matter how much experience you have.  Most companies promote from within raises are hard to come by.  you have to stab your co-worker in the back to move up
bad,"I was one of over 400 applicants for the two available jobs.  I researched as much as I could when I was one of 9 selected for an interview.  I did not expect to get the job because I had no experience.  Once hired I was not really trained outside of what I could learn on my own.  It was not the best for training however, I learned enough to get by which is not ideal.  I was determined to learn as much as I could and realized co-monitoring would be the key to learning as much as possible.  I went out with my piers as often as possible and learned from experienced coordinators.  Also challenging was I did not have computer skills when hired.  The help desk knew my voice and my manager would answer my calls at 7pm on a Friday evening to help me.  As soon as I could, I got my certification with ACRP.  Studying for certification helped me focus on what is important so my sites could be successful."
bad,"Typical day at work is figuring out what materials need to be processed and find ways to do it efficiently and safely.  What I have learned is different aspects of the manufacturing field from the fill department to packaging.  Management is different depending on shifts and actual people. There are those who want to see you flourish within the company, and are willing to help you succeed.  There are also those who do not want to help you succeed, and will make your experience there very unpleasant.  The workplace culture speaks of inclusiveness, but unfortunately there is a sub culture that is not inclusive at all. In fact it is very cliquish in nature, and everything is based on a popularity contest. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the sub culture of the company, because as stated earlier if you are not popular or don't fit in even the most easiest of task are made difficult for you by management and others.  Also the work schedule is sometimes difficult, because there is lack of respect for your life/work balance. The most enjoyable part of the job is actually doing the work and knowing that you are helping someone, somewhere."
bad,Merck is a great company to get your foot in the door with. However job security and advancement is almost impossible. There is also a level of unprofessionalism that exist with the management making it an difficult environment to enjoy.
bad,"Everyday It Took About An Hour To Get The Work Going, But Once We Start Its Constant."
bad,GCA was who i actually worked for. Terrible company. Period.
bad,Opportunities still available albeit a more competitive environment internally.
bad,Not what I thought working for this company would be like. A bunch of college kids that don't have working Proficiency.
bad,"Merck is a solid pharmaceutical company that highly focused on compliance and getting things done the right way.  I've gained wonderful scientific knowledge in the asthma, allergy, and diabetic fields."
bad,"Durante o dia o trabalho é tranquilo, mas temos por obrigação fazer algumas atividades diárias que tomam muito nosso tempo, e em geral, temos que faze-las durante a noite."
bad,Routine same thing every day. Management was not involved in day to day issues.
bad,"Merck was a fantastic company at one point. However, in the past 10-15 years they have lost their customer focus. Their mission and vission states to focus on putting the patient/customer first, but that has been pushed to the side drastically. Merck's current ""mission""/""vission"" is to now cut 15 billion in costs by 2015; they call it the ""15/15 plan""."
bad,Le travail et le cadre me plaisait mais le manager a décidé d'arrêter mon contrat intérim sans raison valable!
bad,Managers are permitted to do whatever they want in order to get work done even at the employees expense of health and well being. It was a great job but I couldn’t do it anymore. They also have to stop with the we’re having a layoff meetings. Please bring down employees. Also please stop putting a blank org charts and say will fill them in as we go along. People have mortgages and families it’s like toying with their livelihood
bad,Il faut être disponible motivée et très dynamique.
bad,"Limited visibility to employee benefits or work life balance issues, employees were a mix of legacy Merck and newly acquired there seemed to be a competition"
bad,Culture is very toxic and paranoid.  Declining industry and poor management have left the company in a constant state of reorganizing.  No one I started with still works there.  Sales division is dead.  Managers are frightened and focused on their own self preservation.
bad,"I enjoyed my daily activites, but not the company.  i learned many products and disease states. I enjoyed the offices that I visited and formed many lasting relationships as well as friendships."
bad,a typical day at work requires you to visit at least 16 clients and I learned to manage my time effectively. Management have internal politics and workplace culture is fair. The hardest part of the job is the long hours in the territory but the most enjoyable part is you meet different clients where you develop your communication skills.
bad,"It was a great place to work. Immediate managers and PMs were supportive and relaxed. Hired at Franklin Lakes. Took job because it was closer to home than opportunity at Orange Rockland utilities in Spring Valley. A month after I started they relocated to Montvale, NJ. UGH. My 30 minute commute from Morristown area went to an hour+. Wish I had taken the job in Spring valley! "
bad,"Contracts are 4000 hours. People that have been there 4-6 months get the permanent position over individuals that have been there over 1 Year. Contractors are belittled, and bullied. They have you training using TQR's but when it's time to interview for a permanent job, that's not taken into consideration. Instead, jobs are given to individuals who have family members employed there. Permanents are very mean. Production side is a mess. Especially in VMF. Management does nothing. There is no one to protect the contractors from poor treatment."
bad,"El desempeño de la labor diaria , es gratificante , debido a las relaciones que has de entablar con los distintos estamentos , y muy enriquecedora a nivel estratégico."
bad,Lack of leadership within departments and across functional teams. A very high turnover rate. Not a great place to work if your plans are to grow and develop professional.
bad,"Though the flex time and vacation policies, as well as compensation benefits, are par or above for the industry, this terrific work/life balance does not make up for the lack in managerial organization or ease of advancement.  There is a gaping disconnect between the goals and regulations mandated by upper management and the information given to employees in order to reach these goals.  There is also a severe lack of employee morale, and management has not yet found a way to show employees appropriate appreciation, nor purge the department of its exasperated attitude."
bad,"Merck was once an outstanding R&D firm.  While it still retains many smart capable staff, executive mismanagement and a string of deeply suicidal layoffs have decimated morale and portend Merck's conversion to a hub of global outsourcing."
bad,"Nice location, a lot of resources to do drug discovery. Learned a lot from different training course. A lot of intellectual challenge from colleagues. "
bad,"Political infighting, poor vision from Management, and obese bureaucracy hinder the efficient operation of this once great research company. New management brought in from outside Merck will hopefully improve the situation, but only if more new blood is introduced. The negative culture is heavily entrenched and will be tough to overcome."
bad,"Growth is a big issue, if you are ambitious otherwise a good company."
bad,"I start there and was so exited. I admired the company and the job was interesting, but... had one person who just so happened to be the trainer and lead. What a pain, and should not have been in that position. The whole department hated her and couldn't stand her,. I tried to talk to my Manager about it to be laughed off, and HR who said and admitted her flaws but they stuck with her. I know they have gone through multiple people since me, so that tells you something. As far as job its great and rewarding, the pay is good and the benefits but not much to say for treating people with respect and dignity"
bad,A good company to work for but I will not pursue this company again. I was laid off with little notice and I think Merck could of done better than that.
bad,"Merck sits on a formerly good reputation; it looks good on a resume when looking for another job, but the experience of working there is a sad disappointment.  Huge leadership disconnect.  Processes are more cover up than correction. Dont let the Af Amer CEO fool you diversity is a webpage tab.   Growth comes with the right handshake."
bad,"Company is full of intelligent and amazing people. As with many companies, reducing headcount and outsourcing where possible.  Extremely ethical company."
bad,"Money is not everything!  You will be well paid, but the money is not worth the stress you will have to deal with while working here.  I would not recommend working here."
bad,The work environment in Virus is not good very good.  Upper management routinely makes poor decisions and the technicians pay the price.  Managers do very little and pass most of their work onto the technicians. It is very difficult to advance your career at this site. The office politics are unreal. Everyone in Virus is looking to leave Merck for other opportunities. I wish I had more good things to say but I do not.
bad,Really bad management. Layers upon layers of incompetent managers. It is getting to the point where I sometimes fear for my safety within the plant.
bad,"Coaching people,Develop people set objectives and do action plan Set sales and distribution targets,monitor sales,reporting etc. KOL Management through engaging in various activities etc."
bad,"- Muchas cosas administrativas."
bad,The management there is always changing what the said to who they said it to....Very wishy-washy.... Always looking to place blame on others... Always using foul language around employees and talking inappropriately during working hours.
bad,"Arbeit gleicht schon Akkord, etwas stressig (je nach Abteilung)...dank Standort Schließung"
bad,"Didn't like mail order pharmacy.  No face to face time  with customers.  Employees were all a number.  If you did well for the company or didn't do well for the company, it didn't matter."
bad,"Merck is a great company to work for, but has been changing corporate strategy which has many people fearful for layoffs and creates a hostile and chaotic work environment"
bad,"Project Management : clinical trials set up, quality and monitoring. Supply management of investigational products and material, outsourcing management and quality compliance to regulations and guidelines."
bad,There is a technician on a multidose line that angers easily and picks on the temps. Her temper turns on and off in a second. HR and managers act like it's just the way she is. A company should have some kind of consequence for Bullying. Disrespect. I finally got to transfer from this unstable dept.
bad,"well, at merck i was a house keeper. i was the guy that cleaned up the offices and the gym and bathrooms at merck it was a good job i loved my job i just wanted more money so i got layed off"
bad,Unqualified coworkers and a threatening environment for contractors when I worked there. Busy and unorganized place to work and I did not want to stay to become a permanent employee.
bad,"Frequent process excursions, lack of care in upper management, overall negative atmosphere throughout company. Needs re-structuring and stricter management."
bad,"integrated consumer schience, education and experience into training curriculum for pharmaceutical research representatives"
bad,So not a place I'd refer to anyone.  Environment is conservative and work was not particularly fulfilling.
bad,This company began downsizing the same week I was hired.
bad,"Management is good."
bad,"Good work culture."
bad,"Your standard working hours would typically be between 9am and 5pm, Monday to Friday. You may need to work longer at busy times, for example during special sales promotions or the opening of a new store."
bad,Muito boa e se batesse suas metas se ganhava muito bem.Uma ótima equipe e sempre motivava seu funcionários.
good,"Llegar a tiempo 15 minutos que lo estipula tu entrada, checar al ingresar al supermercado, instalarme en el punto de venta, realizar el inventario, prepararme para el inicio con dar gracias a Dios por estar con la oportunidad de un nuevo dia laboral bendiciendo mis compañeros y la gente que comprará el producto y por un productivo dia laboral."
good,Culture of entitlement and poor work ethic.  Nothing really matters except for the pipeline.  No focus on costs or other areas besides R&D.  Poor M&A execution
good,I was able to try numerous different opportunities in the company.  All were lateral moves only.  The ability to move up in the company is almost impossible.  Very political atmosphere.
good,"Culture is very toxic."
good,"No work life balance. Leaders are not true managers. "
good,"Witnessed comoany financially struggle, purchase another company and reduce work force 50%.  All while management fumbled financial long term planning or providing strategic insight to avert.  Management was more concerned about politics then doing the right thing with developing new products."
good,Will make more money somewhere else.  Horrible upper management. Bad marketing strategies. Does not care about needs of the employees.  No work/life balance.
good,"Durham VBF, could use more restructuring. Need managers that have experience and people skills. The culture needs to be restructured also. Work-life balance in nonexistent. Pay is not all that good."
good,"Good luck with work life balance, job security, advancement, job culture, compensation, leadership, benefits,  and compensation."
good,The management is average. The company is biased towards contract workers. There is no job security. There are less number of leaves. There is no culture top work from home
good,"Good company with great products, but you will have  no job security."
good,Management is not good but Co-workers are good. Overally Not so good. I acquired more knowledge.
good,"I currently work in a small team with the opportunity to work independently and to be accountable for my work. I have demonstrated the ability to maintain good working relationships, meet project requirements and deadlines by working effectively with managers and co-workers. "
good,"Merck is a great company to work for, however it is  hard to balance personal life and work life. They expect a lot of overtime and weekend work. There is a poor workplace culture."
good,Overall fantastic company with a focus on specialty pharmaceuticals.   Primary care team is transformed to Chronic Care team and shrinking.  Due to this opportunity is slight in the primary care market.   Ideal for oncology representatives.
good,The Merck opportunity was a temp-to-perm role.  I was never included strategically in the team meetings and felt like an outsider the entire time.  It is not a place I would recommend for job seekers.
good,Estresante exite discriminacio en las herramientas de trabajo
good,There was very little influence that the actual person who was doing the work had on making any changes to how the process was carried out. The upper levels made all of the decisions based on what little they new about the process.
good,"Good company to work for with great benefits. The 401k has a match. You get benefits like life insurance, dental, vision, 80/20 health insurance, educational assistance and a good pension plan. There's usually a fitness center in most sites."
good,"A typical work day at Merck has changed considerably over the last 2 years and I would not like to comment on this part."
good,"Office-Based sales for this company is not really sales.  You are trained to present the brochure.  You are not allowed to say anything that is not in the brochure, you must say everything that is in the brochure, and you must present the information in the same order as the brochure."
good,"Good team, had Perform as National Achiever for the sale of Concor."
good,It's a good place to work but they lay you off after 4000 hours. It is very hard to get a full time job even if you are a great hard worker.
good,"cultura de favorecimento e nao de meritocracia, isso desistimula quem quer crescer"
good,"The job was grate i enjoyed my time there the people are polite and manerly and over all a good job the supervisor is unfair and u reliable but other wise the job experience was grate i miss it"
good,"Worked as a scientific promotion office in GI track care group. The new administration at Merck is very sadly very greedy. As a Multinational company, they fail to offer competitive benefits."
good,"A chaotic company like all big corps. Your career advancement and benefits will depend on who your manager is, not on your skills or hard work. Frequent reorgs and layoffs happen almost every year, there is no job security."
good,"No comments to add concerning this firm"
good,"The company itself is a great place to work; however the Managers make working there hard at times for Temp workers and also their own employees. Temp workers are treated with no respect and no value; as if they are useless while Temp sometimes goes above and beyond than Full Time employees. If Management will stop inequality and welcome everyone and encourage everyone to be the best they can in the area they are comfortable with; the Merck Elkhorn Location will even be better than what it is now. The last and not the least, Administration should be more acknowledge, production doesn't happened only around people on the line; Administration also matters. Moreover, people have been at this location for years and feel like new faces are there to take over their jobs. They aren't willing to accept change and learn form the ones coming through; instead they want to be stocked wit their old ideas and mentality and ways of doing things.... DO NOT WORK THERE AS A TEMP..."
good,This was a great place to work 3 years ago.  Management up to CEO believe sales representatives have little impact in the field and they are too expensive.
good,Legacy Merck has a leg up over acquired individuals.  Merck needs to do a better job assessing internal talent acquired from outside Merck and tapping into those skill sets.  Tends to only value skills gained while at the company.
good,"It may be a nice place for employees with benefits, if they don't plan to outsource your position, but for contractors it is hard to have any sense of security or receive any training to succeed in your job."
good,"Merck was going through a rebuilding and it was a very confusing time. My position required to be shuttled around the world to help with site production. It also involved CMO, OEM's and contractors. Having worked at previous OEM I enjoyed the opportunity to use those learnings on the new equipment which was purchased."
good,"As a production tech everyday was busy and everyone seemed overworked and the general attitude was poor. There was a major disconnect between production techs and management and HR. too many mistakes and lack of people skills in management and too many techs allowed to do what they want without consequence and too little staff for the work load. I worked there for 8 months before I left as an upstream tech. When I left I had chronic shoulder, hip, knee and back pain from working long periods of time on my feet on uneven concrete floors and awkward bottle manipulations. I also had bad hand cramping from manipulation of over 2000 roller bottles a week(set up/production). I liked to groom dogs outside of work but I had to quit as a result of the chronic pain. Merck has a lot of potential but between the lack of advancement and poor management I could not make a career there."
good,"Grande empresa com produtos muito bons, porém uma cultura que deixa a desajar. Salários dentro da média de mercado."
good,"Overall company is delivering on its promise to shareholders and customers for safe and ethical pharmaceuticals to the patients that need it and those that can't afford it."
good,Empresa carente de estrutura que não oferecia bons salários e benefícios.
good,"I choose not to tell about a typical day, what I learned, management, co-workers, the hardest part of the job or the most enjoyable part."
good,"Accomplished Senior Administrative Assistant with 10+ years of experience providing comprehensive administrative support at the executive level.  Demonstrates a strong ability to listen and effectively communicate information to facilitate smooth business operation.  Operates independently with a high degree of efficiency and attention to detail in a fast-paced corporate environment.  Adept at grasping new material and effective at providing support using Microsoft Office Suite:  Word, PowerPoint, Excel and Outlook.  While providing daily administrative support, undertakes stretch assignments freeing up bandwidth of other colleagues."
good,"Benefits and pay at or above industry standard, zero job security for sales reps"
good,Empresa familiar con poca visión a futuro y sin una dirección estrategica. pocos recursos para desarrollo profesional y mucha rotación de personal.
good,loved my job untill they laid me off. but it was kool while i was there.
good,Worked through a temp agency ...not hired unless worked temporary for 2+ years. No job security.
good,my typical day when I join pharma
good,"Horrible Management, constantly threatened to terminate everyone."
good,Depending on who I had as a manager. It was great and then not so great. Upper managers like regional directors (all but one) were not to be trusted and looking out for themselves. In out hospital division it was like family. In the chronic care division it was a hostile culture from top to bottom.
good,"Generally good depending on department and management, a face paced environment in which you had to ensure your workload was managed effectively despite other tasks sometimes going against you"
good,"The compensation is decent.  The on-boarding is lacking.  Very inclusive socially.  Work from home culture."
good,"I worked at Merck for almost 12 years. For a hard worker, dedicated, over achiever I never got where I should have been in my career. The coaches move around so much, by the time you get use to one, one is already lined up whose never even worked in operations. You don't get any raises, if so it's barely a 2 %, and that's if you're at the top. It hasn't gone by your performance like it did back in 2012. The culture is great yes, but the morale is down. It's all ran politically. If you don't play the game, you get no where in the industry."
good,"travaille en 5x8,bonne ambiance mais salaire bas et aucune possibilité de cdi,management décalé du terrain."
good,"The company itself is great.moldtek has the best culture and working environment! Always enjoy being there and everyone is so genuine and willing to jump in and help. Very collaborative and encouraging environment."
good,"This is a large company, there are many pros and cons to a large company, but in general, Merck has been a very reactive pharmaceutical company. The culture here is of playing catch up, and immediate and overstressed projects. Any culture here is created by the employees and not by the company. Management usually is looking out for itself, and not for its employees, which is the case in most companies, but when it's a scientific company, and you're looking to become a better scientist, that type of mentorship is extremely important. Merck is a decent place to work if you like coming into work and leaving with that robot sense of mentality"
good,"Good company to work for, job can be demanding and work life schedule can be very hard to handle. It is a union based position so there is heiracry if you will."
good,"- Ability to grow in other areas are limited."
good,"A typical day of work begins with a work meeting for employee training, continues with the review of many emails and programming of new trainings online or in person and ends outside the official departure time with a list of pending to be completed within the week. I learned that you must work extra because the medium is very competitive. The pleasing thing was to meet very talented people and the hardest part of the job was to deal with the lack of flexibility of the management always running against time."
good,"Merck's work culture is most similar to ""Market culture."" I found the workplace could be competitive amongst one another, but really enjoyed the support within my team--I can't say the same for others. I do wish that the culture emphasized more on Human Resource development; however, this issue is driven by the lack of support from upper management."
good,"As a company , its a good company. Speaking on the Durham NC site, the management that is running that site, has created a stressful, cut-throat environment, where it's all about what kind of degree you have vs. the experience you have.  They have lowered the morale of the experienced employees that have been with the company for years and knowledgable of their particular area, by down playing their experience to being minute in comparison to someone just out of college with no experience, even in cases that a non degree employee got a job over someone with a degree, they were paid significantly lower than what the job offers."
good,"The worst product launch I have ever been associated with. A total lack of communication with hospital counterparts and poor decision making from upper management on how to execute a successful product launch.  No communication about benchmark market shares or what the specialists opinions were regarding the product.  No speaker programs with respected KOL's to a target audience of potential high prescribers.  Merck's expectations were unrealistic regarding the product market share due to inexperience from the upper management they put in place, they also lacked any knowledge of the payers and formulary status for the product."
good,Merck is a descent place to work at best.  There are stressful times and management just seems to care about the bottom line and not the employees.  It seems that you're just a spoke on the wheel that can be replaced at any time.  The most enjoyable part is working with some people that are really eager to help you along because ALL of our jobs' security depends on our success.
good,Merck is too scared of its shadow.  Merck has such a corporate malaise that its impossible to change anything...the hardest part of the job is regulation and red tape.
good,Merck has a terrible culture and not a lot of drugs in the pipeline. I had an amazing manager and great co-workers but the upper management is out of touch.
good,Processes are constantly changing and there are so many meetings you don't get a chance to get anything done. Team members are great and are always helpful.
good,"Buena gerència en zona Catalunya, memorable vademecum."
good,"Some old technologies are still at play, need to modernize their technology stack, overall, there is a good blend of storage and compute systems, but cannot do much using these systems when cloud is taking on every area of IT."
good,"After the Schering/Plough merger it went downhill. High numbers of lay-offs but I assume it will level-off at some point. Early years in the research labs were exciting, full-of-innovation and a tolerance of risk. Of course the CEO was tremendous and the company was the Most Admired company for 6 years in a row. It's all about leadership and passion which departed in the mid 90's."
good,The culture in Merck is one of endless red tape. It difficult to achieve change or your goals outside of your department. The threat of layoffs is always looming over your head and affects the way you perform at work.
good,My typical day at work started a little later (830am) then the earlier crew (630-730 am) so there was greater facility coverage during the day.  Every day was different in the fact that there were only 4-5 of us in the Facilities department and any breakdowns would significantly impact what was planned for the day.  Calibration and preventative maintenance activities were performed as scheduled.  Coordination with other departments was necessary.  Management and co-workers attitudes varied. The hardest part of the job was scheduling time on equipment that due to demand had extremely limited down-time and occasionally co-workers that were inflexible.  The enjoyable part of my job was calibration itself.  I have always loved it and it felt great to be successful.
good,"Administración de las cuentas a cargo , ejecución planes de trade , seguimiento  y optimizaron a los PAC de cada cuenta, capacitación de colaboradores a cargo , control y acompañamiento."
good,"no typical day"
good,Competitive edge. Strategically focused. Learning a lot about strategy development and execution
good,"My day would range from 7-10 hrs per day, with little acknowledgement of accomplishments. The management team at this juncture is focused on reducing the numbers which means more challenges for those that remain. The most difficult part of the job is the constant adjustment of what were concrete variables."
good,"Merck's downfall is its management and highly political culture. They hire and promote based on who is liked the best and who is someone's friend, not on actual achievements. They do the same with layoffs, of which there are plenty these days. CEO's make unrealistic commitments to shareholders, and do whatever it takes to meet those impossible expectations, regardless of what it does to its employees at any other level. "
good,"As a Legacy SP employee, we got the wrong end of the stick. Management is overwhelmed and have no real idea what to do. It's a shame that the new head of Merck Research Labs starts his 2nd tenure in the 20% cuts."
good,"Empresa tradicional e com dificuldades de mudanças. Aprendi a ser oranizada e manter a organização, saber trabalhar em equipe e trabalhar com outras áreas. "
good,"Empresa, con un alto enfoque en clientes, desarrollando al representante en multilples habilidades, ejerciendo presion para darse los resultados deseados, con mucho trabajo administrativo, y realizacion de educacion medica continua hacia el medico."
good,"Socialist bonus plan that is to muddied to stand out of the pack in.  Its all about perception and playing the game here.  If you can figure out what is important to your manager and put on the act on field visits, you'll do fine.  If you think your numbers and territory performance will make you stand out....look elsewhere."
good,"After Merck decided to close Geneva offices the motivation to work dropped in all parts of the company. Even the colleagues in Germany become concerned when the reality struck that only hand full of Geneva colleagues would be re-locating to Germany. That meant that the German colleagues have to absorb the vastly increasing work load."
good,Long work hours no thought to work life balance
good,The company has gone through frequent restructures in recent years. Training is minimal for new hires but good opportunity for entry level professionals to break into the industry.
good,"Great benefits, compensation is sub par, work life atmosphere is good but should be better. Working for a publicly traded company can be trying at times, especially if it's in the business of ""saving lives""."
good,"Merck is a big old company. Good compensation/benefits, but career potential is limited. A place for no motivation workers. Organization restructures every year. Not a stable working place."
good,Being a part of Merck was a great time in my career. There are many talented professionals at Merck.  The culture is one of respect and collaboration.
good,Merck traing prepared me for my role as a Clinical Research Associate following my nursing career and for future career opportunities.The training was stellar.
good,"Hardest part of the job is to keep motivated because of the very lean staff. Very hands on deck kind of job, squeezing time to learn is a challenge indeed"
good,"Great company when I first started 12 years ago.  Unfortunately things have changed quite a bit over last few years.  Current sales leadership is poor with no future plan, except to end all primary care sales in next couple of years."
good,Very collaborative and fast-paced environment but extremely overwhelming bureaucratic/administrative overhead that bogs down everything. Non-stop meetings every day means working later or from home / on the weekends in order to keep up with everything. Very likely to be given too many projects / initiative memberships / committee memberships / working groups such that you are continually trying to keep your head above water. Salaries and benefits of the legacy organization are generally not very competitive.
good,"The company is alright as a stepping stone, but that's about it. You can possibly learn a lot, but there is a culture of ""don't take on too much work."" Basically don't challenge the status quo. Change is something that will likely never happen."
good,"Upper management has really deteriorated in quality in the time I've been here, and the culture has suffered greatly.  They pay lip service to high standards and innovation but don't back up the words.  Good benefits and potential for a great career.  Just a down time right now, both in pipeline and morale."
good,"Joined as Intern in Sigma Aldrich Now Merck acquired Sigma. "
good,"This is a rewarding, challenging, and competitive career; however, the future of the industry has gotten very uncertain.  We continue to reduce headcount.  That's my primary motivation for seeking other opportunities."
good,"Merck is a fast paced environment, only those with extensive amount of experience would be ale to thrive at Merck. There is a lot of training to  take advantage of though."
good,"Great place to work, but they are not consistent in their process making learning difficult.  This also creates an environment where advancement is confusing and difficult.  High performers are not recognized enough and roughly 1/3 of entry level technicians perform the bare minimum. I have never worked at a company with such poor managerial oversight.  It is nice not to be micromanaged, but a proper balance is needed."
good,"The interview process is really hard but you will feel really good if you got the job after all that long process. Excellent benefits, grow and learning opportunities, but difficult job work/life balance."
good,Pharm Sales jobs aren't for everyone.  Mostly enjoyed the job and would've stayed if the new manager had not fired or run off 90% of my team.  Most people were nice and supportive
good,"science-driven culture"
good,This was an interesting company.  Upper management was completely a mess.  The company was in the middle of tremendous flux.  I would not recommend this company either.
good,"Durante minha trajetória dentro da Merck (cerca de 3 anos), eu tive a oportunidade de me desenvolver muito pois pude trabalhar em diversas áreas e conhecer diversos departamentos e ferramentas que me ajudam a ter, hoje, uma visão analítica e integrada de tudo. O dia a dia das pessoas que trabalham lá costuma ser tranquilo, cada um com sua rotina de reuniões e deveres."
good,The laboratory was very isolated with basic microbiology techniques. Not much training. Communication needs to be improved. Poor planning resulting in working overtime with no pay.
good,"Management needs to be better there. Cannot afford to make mistakes, and there is no confidentiality in what you do. You learn a lot there."
good,"the coaches does a poor job with interacting with the team members, it's like they make you do and learn everything on your own, the coworkers will not train new crew members and they have very bad attitudes in the vmf department."
good,Great atmosphere to work in. Easy to come to work day by day. Learned multiple tasks to help me to be able to advance in my career.
good,"I believe that i made a difference each and everyday not only with my products, but to the lives of all the people I would come in contact with on a daily basis. I really love what I do."
good,"Empresa dinâmica, fruto de pelo menos 10 fusões e ainda sem identidade própria."
good,"Competitive Vaccines Manufacturer.  The facility is growing rapidly to supply the demand for life-saving vaccines. As with all companies, there is room for improvement within the structure of the site."
good,"A typical day was like groundhogs day.  Dropping samples- waiting in the lobby forever- being treated poorly by the receptionist- catering specialist for ungrateful staff.  Just because I am knocking the job doesn't mean that I am bitter, resentful or have bad feelings towards Merck.  Quite the opposite- it was a good job with good pay and excellent benefits.  I personally was miserable doing it.  I was a like a square peg in a round hole.  It just wasn't my thing.  When I was downsized- it was the best thing that ever happened to me.  I am an individual- and being made to regurgitate information in a very awkward and unrealistic way was an insult to my intelligence.  If we were allowed to sell in the way that suited our personalities- then I might have liked it- but everyone- management down- is nothing but overpaid drones.  My co-workers were ok- didn't form any life long bonds.  But I thank Merck for giving me the opportunity and allowing me to experience working for a great company and giving me a chance.  I learned a lot about myself.  And I went on to do better things because of it."
good,A typical day is relaxed but you are most definitely are going to work long days and nights.
good,"Receive and distribute telephone calls and email messages as appropriate, both in Spanish and English, taking clear messages and passing them to the appropriate member of the team. Respond to queries and visitors promptly and in a friendly manner. Control flow of incoming and outgoing correspondence. Assist other departments with administrative tasks as requested."
good,The company did many nice things.  There are however too many layoffs in the industry as a whole.
good,No longer a fun place to work at. I would prefer not to speak badly about the company.
good,"I had great managers who helped me advance and I had horrible managers who held me back.  There was always turnover in management, restructuring and downsizing and fear of layoff."
good,"Marketing skills at Merck India Limited. "
good,Typical pharmaceutical work place; I have been blessed to work with wonderful clients that make my job a fun & positive environment to enjoy each & every day.
good,"Merck is not the company it once was.  Top-level management has wasted billions on drugs that never came to market and the merger with Schering-Plough was a questionable move, especially since most Schering-Plough drugs have not come to market either.  Merck is banking on PD-1 to be a breakthrough cancer drug and it very well may be, but right now morale is low, layoffs loom and the pay scale is only average for the industry."
good,"Many shifts to choose from, so if you are not a fan of the typical mon-fri, 9-5 job, they will have plenty non-traditional shifts. The work to life balance is a bit difficult, when on the company side. Benefits are worth it. It is a very good fit for a young, single, family-free individual."
good,Long hours are expected and there is a poor balance between outside life and work.  The work is fine but the management is poor.
good,After 5 years at Merck I had been assigned 9 different managers.  The attrition is very high due to the lack of organization and very little competence in the organization.  It is hard to have any consistency as there are enormous layoffs almost every other year and constant changes in leadership and staff.
good,"The hours are very flexible, I started at 6:30 am to avoid rush hour traffic. You develop very strong relationships with coworkers internal and external.  I have gained valuable experience on different studies and TA.  This is an ever changing environment with new procedures to learn daily. But you can always find someone who has recently done the process to help you through it."
good,"When name brand Rx is downsizing constantly, how good can it be?"
good,"Short term, somewhat specialized project. I was hired to assist management from Geneva, Switzerland, Darmstadt, Germany and Madrid, Spain relocate to the Rockland Massachusetts office. "
good,Some Merck managers provide the work/life balance needed.
good,Coworkers were the best but management style was poor. The culture is changing at Merck and there is no room for advancement. 
good,C'était une expérience en intérim je le conseil à dautres
good,"Good salaries on offer, but systems are dated and the wheel turns very slowly. The culture (especially among upper management) is very poor and self-promotion is very evident. Silos are rife and there is not a great sense of team, which is a major turn-off. However, in general fellow colleagues are very approachable and pleasant."
good,"MERCK itself is fine, but if you come in as a contractor things aren't so good and getting even a minor pay increase is practically impossible to accomplish."
good,"Job Work/Life Balance: Non-Existent - Overworked; minimum expected is 50+ hours/week"
good,"My experience with my manager has been terrible. He wants me on-site 5 days per week because I manage a team. A team, which by my own decisions and what was best for them, that is off-site 2 days per week. He is ""old Merck"" at its finest and does not want to be challenged or pushed towards anything except what he has his mind set on. His boss (my old manager) was awesome, but off-site, so she had no real visibility into his impact on the team and the culture. Its been terrible and no one cares because he has kissed up enough to be trusted to do a job that no part of his education or experience equipped him to do. "
good,"Bonne ambiance et bonnes conditions"
good,The Company didn't have a strategy they change every day. You define your goals and strategy for 5 years and one day the CEO change everything because he want it.
good,"Poco reparto de utilidades, bonos muy bajos o nulos, no hay equilibrio trabajo- familia."
good,Culture for field based employees is based on the district and regional management style. Field employees do not have the filters of appropriate behaviors particularly from customers.
good,Management was not like the original management that the company started off with.  The turnover rate is extremely high.Typical day at Merck is gowning aseptic for 12 hour shift and 1/2 hour lunch. People are the best.
good,"Values education. Not competitive compensation. Fairs OK on work/life balance. Good perks, health benefits, retirement benefits. Slow to adopt new technologies."
good,"un travail varié, une bonne ambiance. Travail en solitaire très agréable."
good,"Merck Medical Affairs:"
good,"The atmosphere was laid-back, but also had an underlying competitive culture. Colleagues are passionate and driven.There are groups that are accepting of new people and others that are exclusive. If you don't mix well with a superior you may have a hard time moving up despite ability."
good,"I don't regret my time with Merck but I started with a much smaller company that was eventually bought by Merck. With Merck, you are just a number. I really enjoyed my co-workers. Managers set often unrealistic expectations due to the unreachable objectives."
good,"O foco não é realmente os colaboradores, excesso de trabalho. Pessoas e convivio bom."
good,About pharmaceutical sales; about business management; sales relationship building; marketing strategy and skills; client relationship building; training on many drugs
good,not enough time in the day to accomplish all tasks well. layoffs were in the works at the end of my time at Merck which created an enormous amount of tension and stress to employees
good,"Entrada 8.30 am, salida 17.30."
good,"Called on at least 10  customers per day, fast paced, results oriented. Hardest part of job is access to customers. Most enjoyable is educating the customers"
good,"Merck provides an environment to learn about yourself and capabilities.  However, the communication from management is lacking and slow moving when it does occur.  Hopefully, the evolution of the sales representative will change to more of a partnership as time progresses."
good,"Is a good place to work but the actual situation in the country have been changing everything, inclusive the opportunities in the Pharmaceuticals"
good,"Merck is exactly what you would expect from a major pharmaceutical company in the United States. Wholly concerned with the bottom line, many of Merck's employees live in constant fear for their jobs. If Merck can save money by outsourcing positions to contracting agencies or by consolidating positions, it will - often to its own detriment."
good,"Excelente portafolio y como corporación con comunicación fuerte, investigacion e información cientifica de soporte etico para sus marcas"
good,"Mi rendimiento es de menor a mayor, soy optimista dinámico y exigente"
good,"I'm sure there are parts of the company that have great cultures and atmosphere, however that wasn't the case for the group that I worked it.  "
good,"workplaces changes overtime, the business structure is lacking, the people are great. Upper management goes through changes constantly. High turn over"
good,"Diverse and engaged workforce. "
good,"Administrative staff is asked to perform many tasks outside their actual job description.  Salary and bonuses are based on company performance, however, that performance is based on the performance of exempt employees."
good,"Great company that employs bright and intelligent people. "
good,"Falta de estrategia"
good,"Merck has a good record of work-life balance. Whether or not the employees make use of that is a different story. Company has outstanding product, some of the most innovative in the industry, but does not have infrastructure to support centers of excellence."
good,"I worked in Bangalore, India Its a good place to learn new things, many times I worked for day and nights for many customized projects."
good,"Not that bad of a place if you're in the right group, compensation is high location and work life balance leaves something to be desired"
good,"Sales forecasting ,planning  and acheivement"
good,"Culture has changed over the last few year. People are great to work with, however it is difficult to get work done. Input from all areas needed and push back is often the recourse of change that needs to be made."
good,Working at Merck afforded me the opportunity to visit the world to gain exposure to the various Merck entities.  Career growth was stunted based on the design of the company's structure.
good,"Ok. I have enjoyed my time here."
good,"I got an opportunity to start working since May 2012, as Head of a Business Organisation (Clinical Lab Care ) which was mostly an outsourced Business. Management decided to wind-up the Business in December 2013. "
good,"Excellent benefits and pay, but currently going through a serious of cut backs. Another company with poor leadership that doesn't see what is happening in the trenches."
good,"Mixing, charging, activating, troubleshooting, communicating between control room and floor operators, Scheduling and Planning your work ahead of time to be prepared for upcoming Tasks,  Transfering from tank to tank etc,,,,,, Coworkers are great to work with. Hardest part of the Job is staying mentally focused. I enjoyed most aspects of the job, Managment is somewhat lacking due to unforseeable future at Merck. The company is not the company it once was, seems Upper Managment do not really care about employees like the once did."
good,Busy environment with limited resources.  No room for advancement unless you are willing to relocate.
good,Work culture keeps getting worse and worse through the recent structure changes. They are having a hard time keeping their headcount.
good,"Gerencia movida bajo esquemas rigidos, donde la información es poder, poca motivación a la innovación y al trabajo en equipo"
good,"Best part of Merck is the people.  Career progression is stagnant, unimaginative."
good,"Empresa com boa reputação, porém possui um estrutura administrativa confusa quando tenta trabalhar matricialmente. O peso das áreas de suporte acabam comprometendo o equilíbrio com as áreas produtivas"
good,My typical day at work consist of keeping track of regulatory documents and turning them over to the site.  I work with a variety of people and try to forth a team effort. The hardest part of my job is learning how to delegate certain responsibilites.  The most enjoyable part of my job is encountering new faces.
good,"A great job depending on your Department,There is room for advancement great Salary when you have overtime included still a nice place to work."
good,"The best part of working at Merck is the work life balance. In IT there is an opportunity to use summer hours, flex hours or work remotely."
good,Boulder site has excellent management and good opportunities to seek experience in a broad range of areas in the biopharma world.
good,"Merck is good place to working at"
good,Fast paced environment that kept me on my toes. Management was open to employees taking on initiatives of interest.
good,"I work for a German Chemical company based in Nottingham, dealing with products for Life Sciences/Process Solutions, and Pigments.."
good,"Merck was a great job to work for if only you didn't work there a long time and never get permanent. A typical day at Merck was you have a morning meeting talk about the quota for the day then off to work you go. I learned the importance of certain drugs that they supplied. Management was great but couldnt control who got hired, that was my only issue. I had great co workers we had pot lucks, donations for anybody in need of help, and didn't mind helping each other. The hardest part of the the job was working in the summer time because we didnt have air. But, overall Merck was great!"
good,Team I work under is great but I learned Merck will hold you back from getting a better position if they feel you are needed more at your current position.
good,"Productive workplace. Responsible for overseeing inspection and testing of Raw Materials and Packaging components for use in pharmaceutical manufacturing. Managed supervisors, quality engineers, technicians, and inspectors."
good,"Good people.  Limited direction.  I like what I worked on, but budgets were tight and we were constantly in crisis mode."
good,Great Company to work for.  Thankful for the Start-Up Experience
good,"As with most companies, the promises and potential are great when you are first starting with a company. However, the politics at this company make it almost unbearable. Company has outstanding benefits and I love what the company stands for. I just can't get with ""playing the game""."
good,"Long 12hr shifts, 3 and 4 days running, 24/7. Learned that any day I did not learn something new, was a day wasted. First line management always great. Upper Management, when I started with the Company great. Now, not so, could take some tips from first line. Co workers about the best anyone could ask and hope for. Hardest part of job having to have to leave it. Anyone working there should enjoy making something that makes a positive change in someones life who is less fortunate."
good,Top down management style.
good,"Lots of training, very good Instructors, the only thing I can say is you have to wait a long time to get really involded because everything requires certification from Merck."
good,"Management doesn't practice what they preach.  Decisions are not made at the right level so it is never ""Right the first time"".  It is nearly impossible to transfer from a Production position to an entry Quality assurance position because they always hire contractors."
good,"Good benefits, needs new management in certain departments. Work culture is hostile and everyone is overworked except managers. Takes to long for critical decisions to be made."
good,This was a HR contract wherein they were restructuring and on a hiring freeze and were offering early retirement as opposed to lay offs.  There was a lot of tension due to the fact all were aware of pending lay-offs.  I enjoyed the financial analysis and problem solving early retirement to help employees on the lay off list as best i could given the parameters.
good,"A typical day at Merck involves schedules and tasks made for the week. There are tasks set for certain days and there are tasks that listed for your work schedule and it is your responsibility in managing that workload. Production and other things can change on the fly so most of the time you have to be on your toes. Management could always be better, but there are some in management due to ""knowing"" someone of there was a backdoor. Some that should not be in management due to abilities shown. Workplace culture is amazing...as long as you are a permanent MERCK employee. The hardest part of the job involves some micromanaging. The most enjoyable part involves working with employees who does want to make a difference even if management is against them."
good,"I was part of the vaccine process development division at Merck. For the first few months there was training, which meant most days there was not really much to do since doing any lab work required training. There is definitely favortism between who gets what responsibilities.The team did not have any highly skill scientist like a principal scientist working in lab which would have been nice. The project itself was not what I was expecting and was below my expectations in terms of what I was expected/hoping to learn."
good,"Typical Global company they pay fairly but there is no training, advancement or opportunities outside your current role.It is a large company so the Global management is as good as any company but the local management is lacking quality people."
good,Were no merck empyled people were i worked. Hard to get ahead unless knowing someone. Did not have good growth for temp emplys. Chould not get out of 2nd shift easly.
good,"Merck is currently undergoing changes due to a somewhat ""dry"" pipeline. Corporate culture is competitive and could be overwhelming. There are many bright people working at Merck."
good,"I have spent the first four year of my career at BioReliance, which is a subsidiary of MilliporeSigma, or Merck Kgaa as known globally. BioReliance is a good company to start you career, and it offers a good introduction to the biotech industry. However, your experience will mostly be limited, and thus your development as well."
good,It's a good job to beginning your career. It's not like working in most pharmaceuticl company. They expect you to give a 125%. It's a zero tolerance company.
good,"Do not wish to write a review. It is not necessary."
good,No advancement opportunities. My manager was great but the company as a whole did not have many opportunities for advancement.  When they did they were hiring externally.  Not much in the pipelines which is why they continue to have massive layoffs and letting go some great tenured people.
good,"This is a slow growth company with a limited pipe line.  An acquisition must be made to pave the way into the future.  There are opportunities in Oncology, Anesthesia and Acute Care Hospital, but these products will not keep the lights on."
good,Merck was once a great company.  Not more interested in activity for representatives instead of doing what is effective.  Still great aspects about the job but with the difficulty in getting new first in class medicines to market and the lack of innovation by management things have become stagnant and they lay off reps constantly which does not help create a happy working environment.
good,This was a short term contract and ended on time.  The job consisted of reviewing requirements from two different requirement documents and then reviewing the systems being developed to determine a gap analysis document.  Much of the time was spent meeting with managers and developers to develop plans for next steps.
good,Merck was a great company to work for but has slowly declined over the years. I recommend Merck for someone just getting out of collage and starting a career but for the aged professional you can do better. I have been with Merck for 18 years and feel its my time to try something different. In 2019 Merck retirement ends and I believe a lot of the older employes will leave.
good,"Steam Boiler start up in the morning "
good,"In working here, I found that some of the supervisors were very immature. However, the boss that ran the dept. was pretty cool and accepted some of my ideas in which the immature management did not like."
good,"Eu gostei muito de trabalhar na empresa."
good,Working as a Machine Operator in a packaging facility was all new to me the time but was a learning experience that showed me how important quality is in  products as well as a safe work environment.
good,"Fine place to work, no advancement opportunities, very political. A lot of time spent in meetings getting direction from superiors. Big corporation with lots of money and not that much efficiency"
good,Dynamic fast paced working environment with excellent workforce and the best team to work with. Company with lots of potentials to impact culture and market place.
good,"I was Senior Production Officer in Merck Sharp and Dohme of Pakistan.It was my parent company with respect to production Operations.I did lot of work there and get hands on training in Production.I spent too much time there even in weekends to align the production and to meet the targets."
good,"Good co-workers, very professional, knowledgeable management.  Good company culture, flexible.  Would have been better with better work life balance ."
good,"with a diminishing employee and job count with outsourced jobs, there is very minimal opportunities to advance in your career and the threat of layoffs makes the work place stressful"
good,enjoy working with a lot talented scientists. provided a lot opportunities to learn instrument skills and working experience.
good,"Good benefits, and facilities.  work-life balance can be tricky thin line. During active projects, managing schedules is challenging."
good,"Dia corrido, com bastante atendimento ao cliente, contato com a produção e outros departamentos."
good,"To do PM and CM for the production equipment."
good,"Was working on contract through a recruitment company. Didn't feel like I was always included as part of the team, as I was not involved in certain events because I was not with the company. I was the only one on my team like this, so found this quite isolating. Other than that, it was a fine place to work."
good,"Merck is a great paying job to have, however, my hours were Monday-Friday, 2nd shift.  This is a terrible work shift to have if you have kids, so I struggled with this.  Also, the commute was 45 minutes, one way, which was exhausting.  The company itself, provided great benefits and great pay, however, more often than not, our safety, as employees, was placed 2nd to the successful completion of the final product."
good,"Though the decision making process is very slow, several relevant decision at top management level at the end  have been taken  based on emotional and political components, than objective analysis of data, which at the end resulted in the destruction of a relevant part of the CNS pipeline."
good,"It was ok in the begining but  believe the company is not at that site anymore, Come in start sourcing to buy products some co-workers were helpful"
good,"Poor management making poor decisions. They do not care about their employees. Actually they don't even care about their product. All they care about is that the paper work is done right."
good,I worked at Merck for more than 20 years and thought I would retire there. Unfortunately the CEO is making a mad dash to cut the company in half. They will likely survive although I do not think they will thrive. Most of the people I know who remain are staying for stock options / pension rather than passion.
good,I have learned about people management and leadership in a tough environment.  The hardest part of my role is the global aspect and finding common ground for all the leaders around the world.  Excellent people work for Merck!
good,"Great place to start career. A lot of work so good place to build experience. Great work life balance as well, with telecommuting"
good,"The year I went, there was site merging and management restructuring. Many layoffs. It is not stable. I worked a lot and my work was stolen by my blood sucker manager. I gained experience and left Merck several high quality BI Systems."
good,Good place to grow and learn some useful skills. Working conditions could be stressful depending on area of expertise.
good,"Very professional workplace where the main focus is on building talent."
good,"Days usually consisted of long complicated meetings.  Problems are typically overly discussed and decisions that are finally made are usually re-discussed and changed by the next levels of management."
good,Conducts customer visits. Ensure sales are generated. Customers needs should be addressed.
good,"Lots of things to learn with challenging projects, limited opportunity for personal growth. Lots of good co-workers, but bad managing styles. Company is constantly changing, you never know what to expect next."
good,"Merck is flexible in its work/life balance.  Can often work from home and work different hours.  Most coworkers are nice, but there is not a lot of time to get to know one another.  Most work in their own space.The culture and moral is a bit low at the moment as Merck continues to downsize."
good,"The company upper management has made some real blunders in the past and it is costing the dedicated employees their jobs right now."
good,Solid group of professional people.  Focused on attaining sales goals via building strong customer relationships.  Ensuring complete clinical  knowledge of given product mix.
good,Learned a lot. Company lost its vision from Roy Vagelos. Sad.
good,"This position is fun because everyday is different, there is always a new challenge so it was never boring. My co-workers are amazing, we are a small team and we go above an behind to help each other. Management is inexperienced and it reflects in the day to day operation of the team also, compensation is very low which is the main reason why I'm pursuing other opportunities."
good,"people oriented."
good,"Nice place to work, but they will not hire contractors. Do not cummulate vacation time, do not get paid for days off and pay does not rise."
good,"• Utilized Data Entry Guidelines to entered incoming data based on the protocol, the sites and patient specifications"
good,"There isn't much room for advancement. To get ahead, you have to work someplace else for a period of time, then come back."
good,Company values work and life balance. It a great place to work
good,"At Merck, you continually hear (from the CEO) that ""our employees are the backbone of our business and our greatest asset"". The problem - its all talk. As with most big businesses, it all comes down to the almighty dollar. In more than a dozen years at Merck, I learned that no matter how proficient you are at what you do, there is no real appreciation for the employees. As can be seen with the recent corporate cutbacks, most of the employees that were laid off were loyal employees who had been with the Company from 12 -25 years. Many of us were high performers – but that wasn't even taken into consideration. I think the decision was made based primarily on salary and how much the Company had to put into the employee pension plan. Now they're hiring new, younger employees (at much lower pay) to back fill our positions. Time will tell if the loss of experience will be translated into inefficiencies and compliance issues."
good,"Overall a nice place to work.  Decent benefits, and potential for growth.  Management  labeled more as coaches which is a better  to help you feel like you're being coached rather than micromanaged.  Most managers here let you work independently and expect a follow up, and help you to develop goals.  Structure could be better but overall a good place to work."
good,"Career continuum overrated."
good,Work is not labor intensive. Workplace culture is innovative and safe. Management tends to needs as best as they can. Most enjoyable part of the job is the people and the culture.
good,The Wilson site is a great place to start a career for those looking to break into the pharmaceutical industry. There are some issues with management.
good,"Low work/life balance, fast paced, authoritative culture, lean and mean, company compensation and bonus' could be better. Advancement opportunities are highly political and must be friends with the right people to go forward. Many people in positions that they are unqualified to be in. If you are on a good team then this is a good place to work."
good,"has typical big company problems and typical big company benefits"
good,You are just a number. Great benefits but unfair advancement. Ops managers are probably the worst hirers who get yelled at constantly. Greedy and just not enjoyable
good,"Training was intense yet top notch. I had popular drugs (zocor/maxalt, singulair/fosamax).  I was there for one year. Ultimately I let an ineffective manager ruin what could have been a promising career."
good,It was wonderfull working with merk and i learnt a lot.
good,Culture seemed very inviting and the engineers provided great mentorship. The experience was very enlightening and was very broad in different engineering challenges.
good,Understanding Data Integrity and Cyber Security threats and vulnerabilities in manufacturing environment in Factory 4.0 modernization effort and suggesting solutions
good,"A typical day at Merck would included talking on the phone most of the day.  We would take incoming calls from physicians, retailers and consumers."
good,I worked a 6 month internship here 20 years ago. My input is quite old. It was a nice bunch of people at the time......................................
good,"I increased my pharma experience with the various web application projects. It stretched across a lot of groups"
good,"Depends on which manager you get...if you will advance or not...do your job and keep you head down and its an OK job. If you get a micromanager its a rough go...biggest complaint is moving target on quota...if you start to make too much in bonus, they will move quota at mid year or late September so you cannot reach bigger bonus money."
good,The work place was in a good condition to work.  Productive assignments and overall environment was convenient for the staff.  Full time job with good pay.
good,Typical day. there are not many typical day at merck. in the winter we removed ice and snow at the site.Then i would go to production and do my rounds. checks all the equipment . so on and so on
good,"I was a contractor so don't know much about the culture, benefits or the environment for full time folks but I did enjoy working here mostly due to the team and management I was working with. I was a junior resource at the time so i worked with great mentors."
good,"temporary no chance to be made permanaent"
good,"Empresa muito boa para se trabalhar, porem atualmente com liderança muito voltada para a propria carreira ao inves do negocio."
good,I good in through a temporary assignment.  I learned the practice of filing patent with the USPTO.  I earned a invite to become permanent. I am not sure what is going on at Merck & Co Inc in 2018 I have not worked there in overy 20 years.
good,"Sales quotas are the same for every rep each year. Hence, if have been successful first 3-5 years becomes incrementally more difficult to hit quota compared to territories with high turnover. As a result, much of the best talent leaves for distribution jobs or higher paying competitor offers. "
good,"la persecución laboral se evidencia cuando opinas distinto a tu jefe, las negociaciones se manejan de forma transparente, ganan gana con los clientes"
good,"I worked in the clinical ops area doing monte carlo enrollment models.  The management is weak, unrealistic pressure.   Not enough interest in developing better data sets in order to really measure site effectiveness."
good,"MAH is very much a start-up company and lacks the structure and culture of a more established organization like Merck Human Health.  Buyer beware!  Don't join if you can't stomach a lot of ambiguity, chaos, and decisions made on the fly."
good,"If you don't need a fast pace, meaningful career path, or sense of purpose, Merck might be a great fit. Even at its leanest levels, it's a comfortable place to work, with a nice cafeteria, gym, childcare center, and flexible work arrangements. It's just such an inefficient, large company that it's not always the most fun and engaging way to spend a career."
good,"Good company to work for. employees are very helpful. To many middle mangers in meeting without results happening. Directions are not clear. No urgency to get items / task done. Top ,management has no accountability for there results."
good,We were busy non stop from the time you came in until your 8 hours were up or until the work was done.  No room for advancement unless you were in the good old boys group.  Hired as monday to friday days and several holidays off except good friday.  Which is really not true.  have been made to work almost every holiday and weekends a lot. The worst part of the place is the lack of communication from the management.  My advice don't believe anything they tell you.  Everything is up to management decision and not by company policies posted on website.
good,"Entreprise en fort développement, construction de nouveaux bâtiments, de ce fait l’organisation est un peu médiocre."
good,Loved a couple of the jobs a had there due to the employees I worked with. Merck tends to hire pretty good and talented people. The culture is a bit cut-throat and more is always expected - life-balance was not usually a phrase in-play when I worked there years ago and am not sure what it is like currently.
good,"Merck is a wonderful company however, the compensation is not competitive, especially for Administrative contractors."
good,Merck was a productive work place and team oriented learn a lot about there processes and hardest thing was trying get employee's change there bad habits and to get them to understand and follow the new methodology that was being put in place.
good,"Pay is decent, and the company is learning the specialty marketplace.  Colleagues helpful.  It is harder to learn Merck than it is to learn a new disease state or business line.  Hiring patterns and retention rate illustrate this."
good,I am thankful to this company for work experiences I have for the past 5 years from PtP to AtR. I am confident now to take bigger roles in any new company.
good,"Sat at my desk all day and answered helpdesk calls all day long.  It was software support, not hardware networking like i was trained in.  There was no ""family"" type of work place."
good,enjoyed the experience I had with learning customer service but with every job it was just a way of learning myself and the potential I had to becoming a better me
good,"Good, fast paced, good people, great safety program, always be safe and help others, team environment, always help a team member, no body behind, good"
good,"Do not have proper management with technology team."
good,This is a great company to work for but it is difficult to get in through the contract positions.  They are realigning their workflow to outsouce to an RPO.
good,Merck is a very competitive and interesting place to work. The project managers always had timelines and organized directives for their study. Hitting objectives are very important.
good,Scientists in different sites need to fight for projects and it is not always a pleasant experience.  Need to be visible to keep the job and get promoted.
good,"Consumer Healthcare division was acquired by Bayer. Before the acquisition, we enjoyed working for Merck. It was much better when the company was Schering-Plough, in my opinion."
good,"Merck has a good work environment. The people are helpful and willing to listen, with good training for new employees. The management allows you yo learn your position without too much interference."
good,Merck is a great company for Sales Reps just starting out in the industry.  I had a good overall experience with Merck in terms of Management and job satisfaction.  The main downfall I would have to say is that Merck is not a pay for performance company and they really aren't competitive from a salary perspective.
good,"Work at Merck was wonderful prior to the reverse merger with Schering Plough Research Institute.  Upon the merger completion, there were hundreds to thousands of job lay-offs.  The culture became volatile and there were so many people vying for positions, as we knew redundancies would be eliminated.  It became a very cut-throat environment and not a healthy place to work."
good,good training grounds for those that are science oriented. limited ability to advance. limited pipeline. tenured management  lacking the ability to maneuver competitive environment and lacking technology skills to keep up with business needs.
good,in the months leading up to contract end it's been a little rocky. but prior to that it was a great job. My manager made it very tolerable and I really appreciate that.
good,"La empresa en general tienes excelentes beneficios socio-económicos, pero dentro de los directivos de la parte operacional no hay objetivos bien definidos."

good,"Work / Life Balance"
good,"Was junior level marketing role, and learned a lot. Ultimately I left because of other opportunities. It's a great place to learn about healthcare industry and marketing tenets."
good,"This job was stable but tedious. It was mainly data entry, so the work was very repetitive. However it was consistent and the pay was well above average, so I cannot complain."
good,"Declining opportunity and zero job security.  Job performance is becoming less of a factor in hiring/retention decisions.  Overall, I have enjoyed working for Merck."
good,"enjoyed my time there and some people there are friendly."
good,"Merck is a employee friendly organisation, focused on employee development. Merck is driven by its values and ethics."
good,"VISION"
good,"It was my first job,  I was thrilled and accepted as a great life experience to encounter the corporate culture."
good,"Merck is very good client to work. you can manage your personal life and professional life properly. Management is friendly at Merck, you can enjoy with them while working and learn more things"
good,"IT was very stressful, the company was going thru a audit. They had issues with government agencies and their processes were not correctly implemented."
good,"Merck was an on the job training positon in which I got to learn about the different types of medication on the market. Because of the privacy act statement, we could look at people records but we couldn't discuss them. I enjoyed working at the company but the hardest part was we had to push Merck's products on the patients."
good,bonne ambiances prépararatrice de commandes de medicaments
good,"this department has been outsourced, was Ok when existed, mgt support was limited, hours ok and rotated from week to week, good entry level customer service position"
good,The company focus is on research and tends to forget to work on customer relations and ensure adequate supply for currently available products. Departments don't always work well together and have an attitude of that is not my job or we can't support that instead of working together to find a solution. Some areas are better than others. They do put in an effort to build talent and promote from within at certain levels but appears that more senior mgt is coming from outside the company now.
good,Merck once was the yardstick pharma companies were measured against. Now they have become an average pharma company with nothing exceptional about them.
good,"hectic, sometimes lack of proper planning and organization. Frequent changes to structure. Health benefits are excellent. Great physical working conditions."
good,"Strong brand recognition in the marketplace and well diversified..."
good,"All actions are taken from an ethical approach."
good,Good place to learn global processes.Pay is good so are the facilities.However in some departments work culture is bad.If this is improved then it will be a really great place.
good,"Dans mon service, environnement de travail agréable :"
good,Trabalhei pouco tempo por lá. Por ser uma empresa muito fechada e com poucas oportunidades de crescimento.
good,"When I first joined Merck, I thought I finally found a company that I could hang my hat and coat upon for awhile.  I saw a company that cared about the well-being of their employees.  Work-life balance, great perks, wonderful educational reimbursement program and job advancement was encouraged yearly by upper management.  "
good,"Um laboratório farmacêutico reconhecido mundialmente, e uma empresa organizada e com boa cultura empresarial"
good,Merck used to be a wonderful company to work for.  Not the case anymore.  It used to be a company focused on its workforce.  This is no longer the case.
good,"Merck provided some of the best training in the business though it was entirely book-learning and little to no ""real world"". This may have changed, since my experience was a long time ago."
good,"Merck was my 1st experience in the Pharmaceutical industry.  Training was exceptional! Fully prepared to go into the field and succeed. My co-workers were great to work with and provided a team work environment. I always felt there was so much to learn & Merck was a great first job in the industry.  "
good,"Membre d'un projet d'entreprise sur la conduite du changement, Merck offre la possibilité de s'investir sur la vie en entreprise : développement des compétences, travail en équipe, bien être au travail/ relationnel, suggestion d'idées . J'ai donc eu l'opportunité de mettre au service de l'entreprise mon énergie positive et mon esprit d'équipe pour développer en plus de mon savoir-faire, mon savoir-être."
good,"Nice place to work , got opportunity to learn new technologies in SAP .. workplace is good. Would love to work again with the company ."
good,"good place to work, also good team from production to warehouse to distribution, upper management were out of touch to what was going on."
good,"Compensation is decent, with flexible working hours.  Can learn a lot of skills from team and colleagues."
good,"Merck Serono has been in operation for 350 years with global headquarters in Darmstadt, Germany."
good,I had nice time here. It was a huge place to work at. Nice facility but my job ended up getting out sourced. Other than that it wasn't bad to work there.
good,"It was my dream job. It was exciting and creative. I had no typical day, I went with the flow. I worked with several departments. I learned a lot because of the different needs. I had to answer to different heads of departments. I love the diversity of my work."
good,"Manual assembly of pharma products, packing and shipping. Very clean environment. Job security was not stable because the staff could be reduced when production requirements dropped."
good,"Flexibility on telecommute arrangements and days which you chose to be in office or work from home."
good,"Emploi polyvalent : synthèses, analyses, polymérisations, gestions des stocks..."

good,"training A+ Aseptic techniques, SAS, cell culture Aseptic Techniques, cGMP, Inventory, Welding of cell culture media tubing, Computer programs: SAP, MES, MIDAS., "
good,"This for us is a refreshing note to be acquired by Merck, the giants in Pharmaceutical industry. A Place to be. The management, flexible  shifts, and cab services, making worklife balance easier."
good,"Unstable company that is full of changes.  Management does not allow enough time to recognize the impact of organizational modifications.  Essentially the only constant at Merck is change.  Also, career levels are flat so essentially expect no more than two or three promotions in your entire career."
good,Company was good to start my career. Was able to get good projects to work on initially that help me for the latter part of the career. Merck help me for higher education and supported by Masters degree.
good,"Job Work/Life Balance"
good,The company itself is a great place to work for. There seems to be division in the company when it comes to rules and policy because operations follows stricter rules than other areas. There is a lot of knowledge to be taken from working here and a lot of growth within the company itself.
good,Work in a laboratory. I was making pharmaceuticals I current prescribed. Used large machines to purify the ingredients. I involved shift work. Similar to hospitalist work today.
good,"""When it comes to work-life balance there's no match"""

good,"CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE "
good,"Good company, good benefits but overall attitude is as an employee you are just a number and easily replaceable.  After the merger, it was a hostile work environment due to the fact that no one knew when they were going to get laid off."

good,"This was a great place to get cGMP experience. I was introduced to gowning in a clean room environment, working along side pharmaceutical techs. I worked with engineering to renovate and complete internal projects."
good,Millipore were recently taken over by Merck of Darmstadt Germany. The influence of the parent company is now becoming very evident and a lot of autonomy has been reomved from the palnt and is now directed by Germany. Busy environment with a major focus on systems and there is a lot of duplication of work in other words reporting the same information in several different ways. Very little direction given locally
good,Culture Change after merger with Merck. There have been many layoffs. Future uncertain.
good,"Typical day will consist of lot of meetings"
good,A typical day work usually consist of working in the lab and sitting in from of a computer. People here are friendly. Good environment to learn.
good,Merck is re-focusing the business and job stability is very uncertain.
good,"Merck overall is a good company, but making many adjustments since the 2009 merger with Schering-Plough. The pay and benefits are satisfactory. Career advancement in Facilities Maintenance (FM) has not been rewarding, mostly be attrition. FM work consists of customer and work order requests executed through planning, supervisory, and limited engineering functions, governed by a manager and associated staff. There is interaction with co-workers and site customers on a daily basis. Safety and training are high priority. There are GMP areas. Troubleshooting and participating in the reliability and maintenance of the customer and site equipment has been personally rewarding."
good,"While Merck has the aura of very strong organization, particularly in pharmaceuticals industry, the reality of working at Merck does not align with this image.  Just recently, in order to be more innovative, Merck's leadership restructured its businesses and site locations, eliminating thousands of talented, innovative colleagues. As management looks for efficiencies from cost-cutting perspective, to satisfy short-term gains in bottom line for shareholders, it misses the mark in considering the long view. Much easier to cut positions then manage and use talent to be more innovative."
good,"Perform corrective and preventative maintenance and troubleshoot"
good,The legacy and resouces of Merck & Co will allow this company to adjust to new environment in the long run
good,"Working at MSD is fun and enjoyable as my co-workers there are great to work with and are amazing people, we all relay on each other and work together as one team."
good,"wide-range of calibrated instruments to use"
good,I have been working for Merck for the past 14 years.  I originally started in Finance and am now an Industrial Engineer.  I commute 100 miles every day.  I really enjoy the people and it is nice to know you are helping someone by providing medicine.
good,"I learned a lot while at Merck and developed many skills including scientific expertise in the cardiovascular therapeutic area, account management, project management, thought leader development"
good,Company is going downhill fast.  They only care about profits and have no respect for their employees.
good,non ho recenzioni per questa azienda che negli ultimi anni è radicalmente cambiata a mio avviso non positivamente ma non è questa la ragione della mia ricerca ma bensì è a seguito di un grosso processo di centralizzazione che a brevissimo mi lascerà a casa.

good,Working in a team environment is very informative and a great learning experience each individuals ideas are bounced off one another.
good,"Merck was always a good place to work, however, recently and through the near future, there are a lot of layoffs and people leaving.  Not sure what the future holds at the West Point, PA site."
good,"When we work along with zonal/national sales manager we need to meet the potential doctors 15 inspite of 10 doctors per day."

good,I had started my career in MSD as Clinical Research Intern. The reasan that i loved clinical research is MSD. I have learned a lot things regarding this area. Great experience
good,"As i mentioned below, it is a great experience to work for MSD. Merck is the one of the largest drug company in the world and to be honor being a part of this company."
good,Overall a good company.  Lots of inefficiencies.  Great pay and benefits and good flexibility
good,J'ai travaillée 2 semaines en Mission Intérimaire à Merck Santé à Meyzieu en prépartion de commande. Mon travail était de remplir des cartons en fonction du bon de commande pour pouvoir les envoyés à des pharmacies ou des hopitaux. C'était une entreprise pharmaceutique donc l'hygiène était importante ainsi que le respect des bons de commande. Il fallait prendre les médicaments avec soin pour ne pas abimer la marchandise.

good,"Favoritism, Cut throat, Very competitive. nOT MUCH ROOM FOR ADVANCEMENT"
good,Super enriquecedora a experiência de poder fazer parte da cultura e  dia-a-dia de uma Indústria Farmacêutica.
good,Merck is a top pharmaceutical company to work for however they are experiencing many challenges around costs.  They are supporting key brands and drug reasearch products while aggessively managing costs.
good,I feel like Merck was  a great place to work at. The compensation was great and they care about their employees. I learned a lot there was able to continue my education and graduate with my bachelor's degree. The hardest part of the job was understanding my specific responsibilities due to many changes throughout senior management. I always got along with my co-workers and felt like I was part of a team. Most people were willing to help and educate me on certain issues or tasks so I could better myself and my career. The most enjoyable part of the job was coming into work everyday and working with great people and being able to work with other people throughout the company in different countries and locations. Due to so many changes at the senior management level it was difficult to feel like their was a permanent direction in which my department was going and understanding what was expected of me in my position. 
good,"Good to work with . Challenging , good learning and lot of opportunities"
good,"Great place to work for recent high school grads."

good,bon management malgrès un manque d'organisation.
good,"Merck has many offshore companies based in India, the work culture is not 8hrs, people generally work for 10-11 hrs in Merck"
good,"typical day at work was high productivity, I learned how important it is to maintain a 1% error rate. Management was very poor at the time I was employed over 5 years ago. I worked with great people who were caring, compasionate and fun to be around. The hardest part of the job was dealing with management. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with caring co-workers who liked to help and strive for excellence."
good,Nice co-workers but management is still trying to figure everything out since the merger and there is always a lot of uncertainty and mixed communication.
good,"Great pay and benefits, but that's about it. Job security is going away and the work/life balance isn't the greatest."
good,Planning for three maintenance crews on a daily basis for laboratory facilities and equipment.
good,"Overall Merck is ok. The plant I work at is just starting up and it is very hard if not impossible to advance in certain job functions. They like to use the phrase ""business needs"" if they need to. The pay is very good but you really do not get to do what you are good at. You are doing multiple peoples job and they run as LEAN as possible. Overall they are ok to work for. I enjoyed working in a team environment. The coaches (supervisors) are no help though if you really need some need them."
good,"Merck culture is not to have too may jobs. You do your job and thats its. Nothing more. The best part was still working with my Schering colleagues, but that was soon ended with the downsizing"
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Merck. Merck is a great company to work for and you learns alot about the business. It was a great learning experience, I had no control over being laid off."
good,"Merck has an innovative Oncology pipeline, however the Sales team has too many representatives in the field.  If the commercial side doesn't slow its sales team growth, It is my opinion that Merck will probably downsize in 10 years."
good,"It was decent, some managerial issues as far as collaboration, tight timelines on launching product. Good company, but not much out in Eastern North Carolina, I had a long drive over an hour, main reason I decided to leave."
good,"Pros"
good,It is a good company to work for. There were lots of changes and reorganization in the time I worked there. It was a good experience which I appreciate.
good,For the type of work and responsibilities the job needs better pay. the work schedule is flexible and the time off is awesome.  Managers are okay dealing the situation.
good,Good experience and good training.  Enjoyed working with intelligent people.  Good ethics and values.  Company is above average big pharma.   Little slow in decision making but tries to do the right thing.
good,"We did, have a shut down period at the end of the year, which was always nice, to have extra time to spend with family and friends. I think they should invest in leadership training, and be more transparent with their employees."
good,"Nice people , good work life balance , little overtime required, salary could be more competitive. High employee turnover. poor morale with employees."
good,"La empresa me dio la oportunidad de aprender mucho y formarme como profesional."
good,"Merck is a good company to work for! The one in Austin, is still in the project stage and there is always room for improvement. But, a great place to start your job."
good,"Es una compañía que  opera bajo el principio de seguridad y calidad, así como los principios de inclusión."
good,"It is okay to work at Merck - not the best, not the worst.  Open workspace concept is challenging as you could easily sit in a new location daily.  Parking is a challenge as well."
good,"typical day at work is extremely busy.  Working evenings and weekends."
good,"I worked for the company on a full-time contractual basis, company treats employees well, but only after you receive true full-time employment. Those working under a contract receive benefits, but they are horrible. Once you find a full-time position in any aspect of the company (plenty of opportunity to move around and grow), then you'll want to stay with the company until retirement. The company has people in place to make sure you are always taken care of once you become a true member of the second largest pharmaceutical company."
good,"Workload assignment inconsistent and dependent on therapeutic assignments, however there was consistent ability to secure assistance. The managers were supportive and met on a routine basis with regional team and individual for assessments. Travel was challenging and did decrease following NYC 9-11. The learning aspect was most appreciated"
good,"No comment except I left because I had an unsupportive manager who had been in one place for 20 years and had never worked anywhere else. Women in management are difficult, but one industry issue I have with pharmaceuticals in general is we take individuals who have PhD's in some science and expect them to be good at managing people , timelines and business when they are hopelessly untrained for all of those. Yet the pharma industry will give a 28 year old with a PhD a director position who has actually worked in industry a year."
good,"The benefits were great, they paid a good majority of our medical coverage.  The site in Charlotte provided employees with free Starbucks coffee, soda, and bottled water."
good,"Merck is a good place to work, job security is there if you are a good performer.  Strong Pipeline and exciting place to be.  Typical day at work is full of meetings, hard to get anything accomplished when sitting in a conference room."
good,"It changed.  That is all I have to say, but I agreed to write this and now it's forcing me to write something. This is why people don't agree to write reviews anymore."
good,"Merck is a solid good company with many great coworkers.  Good research and development, high science.  One of the cons is the fact it has very little job advancement."
good,"self motivated, disciplined people can excel to the best of their ability.  team approach to selling is a both a positive and a negative factor, depending on the culture of a team.  limiting factors include distance from headquarter culture and management.  the best part is setting your own schedule and having really great products to promote, and the hardest part is being limited on access and a dwindling customer base."
good,"Ben er komen werken om een achterstand op te lossen. Het bedrijf is inmiddels nogal veranderd, dus kan er verder niet meer over oordelen."
good,Large company secure job but slower moving ... Good benefits and work life balance but limited for career movement entrenched middle management. sales incentive structure is lacking but competitive salary..
good,"working hours can be long,  lots of professional development opportunities if you are willing to take risks and responsibilities.  overall enjoyed the collaborative team"
good,"Helpful people, good pay, management willing to help with process. You know what your in for when you are trained correctly. SOP's are changed often ."
good,not enough new drugs developed recently and lay off occurred a round after another. But it would be great if you can survive from the lay off. Good benefits.
good,Pleasant office environment and great to work as a team. Learned eDiscovery processes and data management. The most enjoyable part of the job was working as a team and come with different idea to solve a problem or situation. the hardest part of it maybe was knowing there were no benefits neither recognization for performing a good job.
good,Hours were good. Had great compenastion for overtime. The job was enjoyable while I was there. Unfortunately the bussiness was sold to Express Scripts and closed up in Tampa and they put too many people out of work. The job market is still affected to this day.
good,"I learned a lot at Merck, especially about User Experience. In short, this means determining what the purpose of a project is, who the audience is, and how we get them engaged so they’ll want to learn. Then we test how to best communicate, and how to create a deliverable which will enhance the audience's insight and strengthen the company’s knowledge base."
good,"me gusto pertenecer a esa empresa fue la primera que me dio la oportunidad de entrar a la industria farmaceutica, la estructura administrativa es muy buena, la capacitacion es excelente, pero desgraciadamente me toco estar en una etapa dificil y hubo desestabilidaad economica en la misma que provocaron una serie de reestructuras en la fuerza de ventas donde mucha gente tuvimos que salir de la misma. aprendi mucho sobre el desempeño de ltrabajo analisis de auditorias, organizacion de eventos."

good,Great people to work with.  Emphasis is owning your business.  Good work life balance.  Working on changing their culture and ask for input from sales force with surveys.
good,Opportunity to learn different jobs.  Good benefits and pay.  Pretty good immediate supervisors and lower level mangagement.
good,"Pretty good work place. I get to try on many hats. Sometimes I get to practice my managerial skills, sometimes its environmental monitoring, sometimes i's other things. Promotion system is in a pretty sad state though and the culture is becoming more uptight and strict which sucks a lot of joy out of the job"

good,"I have been back to Michigan for seven years now from doing a rotation in AZ. Had to leave rotation in AZ because regional office was being closed. "
good,"I worked for Manpower, a temp agency, and worked at Merck Pharmaceuticals, which has since been sold to Bayer. The culture was good. A pleasant place to work, The only downside was working as a temp and working for low wages. The regular Merck employees were much better paid. The work was not hard, but was repetitive. They did change positions every 30 minutes to change up the routine."
good,"Merck is an excellent company with meticulous ethics and integrity, but the current state of affairs in the pharma industry has created a very difficult place to work.  The pressures to do more with less -- including fewer and fewer people due to constant lay offs is demoralizing.  Everyone is so stressed and unhappy."
good,"Performed training "
good,An excellent learning experience within a global company.  Lots of chances to learn and grow if you seek them.
good,I worked for Merck for only 4 years. The hardest part of the job was getting used to the constant remapping of territories. The best part of the job was working with amazing reps and managers. Salary and bonuses were fair.
good,"Es una empresa con altos estándares de control a todos los niveles, administrativos, económicos y en manejo de personal. Aprendí a  trabajar bajo alta presión y un elevado numero de reglas. Conocí a gente muy profesional y con muchas habilidades en el área administrativa y ventas, pero sumamente estresada y con alto compromiso con la empresa. La parte mas difícil fue el cumplir con la alta demanda del trabajo administrativo y la parte ejecución en campo."
good,"Great company. Room to move around and flexible work arrangements."

good,"i am working in merck millipore from last 3.8 years in this company i learned a lot like management of time,i think this is most important to make your day to day work fruitfull .i learned that how make yourself calm in bad situation. my convencing poer had been increaed"
good,"My typical day at work was very busy, I had a lot of managers, employees and vendors who depended on me. I learned a lot about the consumer care products. The hardest part of the job was trying to get about 5 Vice Presidents to have a meeting at the same time. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the managers to accomplish their tasks and being appreciated."
good,"Day at work is starting at 8.00am or before, after 1h cycling. Job is about coordinating activities around preparation, planning, writing and submission of periodic reports. It is about being the central point and having good contacts with all departements in the company."
good,EMD millipore is merging now with Merck (Germany)
good,"It  was an interesting experience, and it wasn't positive. I found the department I worked for had low morale, with employees that were in a perpetual bad mood. If you brought this up to management, they made excuses. It's akin to enabling bad behavior. You were made to feel inadequate for asking questions from co-workers, although you have to rely on them because there is so much to learn. I found the environment toxic and the culture depressing. Because you may start of as a contractor with very poor benefits and lousy, subpar health insurance, you get to hear about the actual employees that surround you with excellent benefits. This company would rather pay their upper management lucrative salaries and short change the contracted employees. If you ask about it, you are told to ""worry about yourself'. There's alot to learn and surprisingly, the training lacks cohesiveness and is inadequate for the job. In an interview, ask why they are hiring and about their turnover. Also ask why the previous employees quit, because quit, they do. This is not to say all locations function this way, but the one I worked at did. It was an utter disappointment."
good,Merck was the 1st warehouse I was hired to and taught me about what I would come to against as a future industrial employee. It especially helped me learn how to develop and strengthen my teamwork skills.
good,"The company is run with integrity from top leadership..........."
good,"Bonne entreprise mais quelques défauts : parking notamment, prix des repas, bureaux de production trop petits, pas d'ordinateurs pour tout le monde"
good,Good work experience but too much changes on paperwork. Ground work was not build strongly when launching new products. Allergy range & Cardiovascular range products build a strong foundation & loyal prescription
good,"As an employee for the past 10 years, I have watched the company transform through various mergers.  The culture have evolved along with the management, however improvements are still needed."
good,Merck has it's good and bad like any other company. My tenure was god for learning and development that I do appreciate. I wish the Merck Co. great success.
good,"Merck & Co. has a great global history and has produced many successful products.  The company (like many others) has become too large and bureaucratic and can be difficult to work there.  The business is cyclical and when the products are selling well - everyone benefits.  However, when times are tough, pain is spread.  I learned a lot during my time at Merck but was glad when the business unit was sold to another company."
good,Worked for Merck as a contractor on a 6-month assignment after taking off a few years to have a child.  The culture was not team oriented.  Team building would have certainly helped.
good,"work is steady, but don't let bosses find you doing nothing if you have completed your daily assignment. Like most jobs, varying types of personalitues to deal with."
good,"Merck  has been good to me for many years, I have learned a lot and have had varied opportunities. I find that at this point of my career I need to move beyond Merck and utilize the things that I have learned to provide value and leadership in other venues."
good,"Merck was a caring company, and there employees were dedicated. Unfortunately this did not matter to the company. They decided to contract everything out, which meant workers who did not  care aboput theMerck facailty as loyal Merck employees did. Needless to say, left long time employees out in the wind, jobless, and no longer having a secure future!!!!"

good,"As a sub-suite lead, the day began with participating in the managerial shift change meeting in order to prepare for the day. The second level of meetings involved conveying information and necessary action to immediate team . Aside from manufacturing support, manufacturing data (key process indicators) were trended on a daily basis so that anomalies or shifts in the data could be further investigated. Participated with technology in regards to process improvement opportunities or troubleshooting."
good,"Okay to work, contractors are given less options. Contractors are given less opportunity to involve in group activities like socializing etc. They are never properly involved in any activities."
good,Merck-Medco gave me the platform to build my career.  It was a very good company to work for.  The talent there was second to none.  People were always willing to help as I was getting started in my I.T. career.
good,"Typical day at work started off getting told not to arrive earlier then start time, and just uncomfortable the rest of the day. Management were never on the same page. the hardest part about the job was keeping my mouth shut for being yelled at because i was trying to do my job more then expected. The workplace was great just some people made it very uncomfortable."

good,"I worked at Merck for 7 years."
good,"I much enjoyed my time at Merck. The company has great team members and they are easy to get along with. The location is convenient, just outside Boston."

good,"Tell us about:"
good,Enjoyed working for Merck.  They were very helpful & allowed me to use my customer service skills to the highest level.
good,"Until early 2000 one of the best company to work for. As the business started to move in bigger centers, and in emerging markets, it become more difficult, but Merck is still a good company."
good,I did not work on site so my interaction with Merck employees was limited.

good,"Bonne ambiance de travail mais différence de traitement flagrante entre les salariés... Ce n'est pas méritocratique... Par ailleurs, comme il s'agit d'une grande entreprise, les tâches sont répétitives et limitées. Peu de place pour les initiatives..."
good,"Though the time spent was short, it was very productive. I never imagined i could be trained in such a quick an efficient manner but it was possible and thorough. I took a lot from the experience but unfortunately it did not suit my desire to volunteer as it was a full time position."
good,"I enjoyed working at Merck-Medco, they provided their employees with free stock options.And, I learned quite a lot about the pharmaceutical industry.Overall, I had a great experience at Merck-Medco."

good,"It is a great place to learn and develop people."

good,"A rotina do trabalho era tranquila e bem definida;"
good,"I was in a MRL R&D department. Management in disease areas, group managers, and supervisors were supportive, helpful, and focused.  Work load was tough (I was in pre-clinical R&D) but vacation/personal time policies and flexible schedules alleviated the stress.  Positive recognition for going beyond your responsibilities was an added incentive."
good,As an HR trainee I was able to understand how all the department accross a company work and decide how I want to develop my career
good,Merck Millipore is  is a great company to work for and offers an excellent environment for any one who fits in.

good,"- Daily work as per job description"

good,"work honestly with proper implementation of comany strategy"

good,"Niet meer van toepassing ivm met reorganisatie"
good,Behind the times ! needs to be restriuked to fit business model of a modern company
good,"very bad experience, it was very hard to work with the two managers in the same field. workload and the user are good but difficult to handle two manager decisions"
good,"Merck is a great company to learn the pharmaceutical business.  They have great products to offer for patients and are well respected in the offices.  The specialty sales division (vaccine, hospital) are the places to aspire."

good,"Empresa muito bem estruturada com ótimas condições de trabalho, aprendi muitas rotinas de trabalho e aprimoramento dos mesmos.Gerencia sem memoria pois apos 23 anos de trabalho foi trocado minha gerencia que demitiu toda a equipe e superiores nao questionaram o porque desta atitude, infelizmente a parte difícil era o convívio com a gerência da empresa pois não conheciam o processo e direcionavam os funcionários a erros."

good,"It's a good place to work."
good,"If you work for Merck Animal Health and you don't have a veterinary degree, you will not make it to any Managerial position, unfortunately. You can attempt to move lateral but everyone hopes to move upward."

good,"Insight as to how the pharmaceutical industry works, exposure to pharmaceutical terminology, learning about countries you never knew existed"
good,Good work environment and laid back when work is completed but job security isn't there. Management could be better as coworkers will be the main source of help in any area.
good,"A really good workplace with tremendous which offers huge insights to the Pharma industry. However, there is very little job security at the Technician level with little advancement."
good,Buenas oportunidades laborales en una cultura politica
good,"Little interaction with staff as I was a contractor.  Management backed me up when I had a conflict with a problem direct employee."
good,"A company can only do so much to protect employees from their own hiring mistakes. Like many large pharmas, contractors at Merck are easily dispensible and, depending on the leader, subject to dehumanizing treatment. Retention problems disappear when you treat people like people, instead of like machines."
good,"I have worked with Merck, and i have enjoyed working with merck and i my daily ruten was going in morning 7.30 to evening 5.30, and have leared alothere.but as my expenses increased so i have to change it."
good,"Nice environment. Great work ethics."
good,"Too many layoffs."
good,"Empresa com uma carta de intenções linda e maravilhosa, mas na prática não funciona assim, além da jornada normal de trabalho, o funcionário continua a disposição da empresa através do celular e dos e.mails que não terminam nunca."
good,"Management and micro-management ruined it for me at Merck. Products are great, people are awesome. Management and management processes were too cumbersome."
good,"Bonne entreprise "
good,Uma instituição que cumpre sempre com seus compromissos in clusive com a boa satisfação do colaborador.
good,Experienced qualified workforce with a lot of experience that results in learning experiences. Your input is valued. Good Project experience in a large pharma environment.
good,I love my job but I want to move up and develop a new skill but its been extremely hard because I am an operator and have been for almost 10 years now and I have a degree but no experience in anything besides what I am doing.
good,"Great disparity in job expectations depending on director.  This led to 80-90 hr work weeks to meet expectations that far exceeded requirements from other directors.  Good Company, Good Products.  Inconsistent Enforcement/Alignment on job duties and favorites definitely played."
good,Working at one of the smaller Merck plants there is less advancement opportunities as I would expect at bigger sites.  When you hire based off of butt-kissing and nepotism instead of merit it eventually leads to chaos and I see that coming to this plant soon if they don't make changes.  Don't see a future for me here as I am considered an outsider even though I have lived in the area for 7+ years and everyone has already put in 10 years of brown-nosing before me so I stand no chance.
good,"A typical day at work was very routine and at times things could get mundane.  I learned how to work under pressure, and able to achieve customer goals when their life nearly depended on it.  Work place culture was being able to sit for long periods of time while implementing customer service skills.The most enjoyable part of the job was awards and accolades."
good,"my only disappointment longer.is they couldn't keep the site open for Longer. I enjoy working at merck, I've leaned a lot how the management was not in the same page with everybody,the hardest part of the job is your boss doesn't speak English try to commnunicate with that person but merck was great place to work. the most enjoyable part of working there is making medicine that was saving people lives."
good,"The Training area is key to the success of the Organization. This job provided the opportunity of identifying and developing the best talents, as well as working with diversity."
good,"No comment, if you don't have something positive to say, don't say anything at all. This company has a very different culture."
good,I have been working at Merck for 8 years.  They provide a great opportunity to develop a strong career.  Still offer a 401k and pension package for employees.
good,"large, evolving company, high ethical standard, focus on competencies. Difficult for career advancement/stability due to constant change in industry and within the company."
good,The Merck culture is old and stuck in the dinosaur days. Change is very hard to implement and management is very political. It is good for a job but very tough to get advancement. I also don't feel there is much diversity. Most of the leadership are all Caucasian males.
good,"Merck is a great place to work at, however when you are a contract worker you are limited when it comes to the work you do and the information that is given to you.  The culture and the management style at Merck are great."
good,"lean manufacturing."
good,Merck does not reward performance.  They do not compensate employees for doing well in regards to objectives.
good,Good company to work for. It was through a staffing company which makes the position unsecure. Besides that it was a great opportunity to gain experience.
good,Great company name but management is poor. They over work you but pay well. Cut throat culture because everyone is trying to advance. Management shows favoritism and you will get promoted base on favoritism and not performance .
good,"I will never complain or say anything bad about my employment here. The tuition reimbursement really aided in me pushing forward in life and not remaining stagnant. I would love to stay with my organization, but opportunities are few. I just have to do what is best for my future."
good,I worked at Merck as a temp. Chemist III. The pay was appropriate. The work output expectations were appropriate. Onboard training could be improved but overall a great assignment.
good,"It's a good place to work with decent benefits and pay. There are a lot of opportunities to continue with education and training. Workplace culture varies by department but overall, it's above average. Most managers are fair, hard working, and vested in the success of those who report to them."
good,"The job used to be fun but not anymore. No new products coming to market, fear of layoffs, and workload are overwhelming. So much regulation that restricts activities and customers don't have time to talk to representatives."
good,"The work was implementation of the Toyota production system into the business. The journey is at an early stage, so it is fun. I have provided a lot of the on-learning materials."
good,"Alguns processos necessitam de aperfeiçoamento, mas pode-se trabalhar com certa liberdade."
good,It is not a bad place to start working in. It is difficult to move from contract to stuff. The place was even better when it was Cubist before Merck acquired it.
good,"Working for a company which helps save people's lives made showing up for work every day worth the effort. Unfortunately it seems management has forgotten the internal mantra of thinking of the individual first and allowing the profits to follow; instead, every decision now seems to be driven by either increasing or maintaining profits."
good,"A typical day at work depends on which department you are in.  Some departments are lined with cubes where not a peep is heard because everyone is afraid to talk.  Others are small restricted offices where there is a total of 5 maybe 6 occupies, where it is much more informal of an environment."
good,"This company hired temp contract employees. Therefore my contract terminated after two years. Otherwise it was a good place to have been able to grow. A variety of task were performed, not making the job boring. I learned a lot while I was at the job, and took on a lot of responsibilities."
good,Ha trattare con le persone e soprattutto con i medici specialisti
good,"large pharma companies are all in the process of trying to find out the best way to do business. Time with customers is very limited, job culture is not a healthy one. many managers dont have clue as to what they are doing."
good,This job was a very interesting job.  I learned much of ICH-E6 study guidelines and learned how Clinical Trials were run.
good,Good work environment and friendly people. Great science based job   where you have the ability to learn a lot about lab procedures.
good,Talented work force with passion for science and medicine.
good,I learned alot of organizational skills and selling skills. The management for the most part was strong but towards the end became less than anticipated. My Co-workers and I
good,Good company  to keep safe the future and better salary benefits also.Helps me to learn the skills which helps in the future
good,"A very professional place to work at. Very good team to work with, always helping each other out."
good,Interesting and challenging position working with European and Canadian lawyers.
good,"Working in Mnc company like merck is very good experience,but salary/benefits is least."
good,I enjoy research and qualifying biomarker development with innovative designs and ideas.
good,"Um empresa boa para trabalhar e conseguir conquistar experiencias dinâmicas para sua carreira . Tem pessoas de muita competência , precisa melhorar no aspecto de dar mais chances aos colaboradores   que estão ao bom tempo na empresa."
good,Completing HRIS transaciton. Assisting Merck employees with seperation and some benefits. 
good,"He aprendido muchas experiencias y capacidad para relacionarme, facilidad de palabra, trabajar bajo presion."
good,Very professional environment.
good,Working hours of 9 to 5 I enjoyed. A lot of new stuff to work on. People are nice and collaborative. I have been working on same job for long time.
good,Good Benefits
good,"I could describe Merck as a goal orientated environment but also provides some form of relaxation every now and again. The colleagues are very nice and are always willing to help one another in terms of reaching goals. "
good,"I worked for Merck for 17 years. Over that period, layoffs were a constant distraction, and sales representatives were walking on eggshells. Pipeline is not robust, but Oncology product is promising"
good,"I was in my element as I had the opportunity to interact with the public, sharing health and nutrition information. My manager checked on me from time to time as I was based in a pharmacy. I liaised with my recruiter mostly, as I had to submit my time and sales sheets through the agency on behalf of the company."
good,"Merck taught me to be the best healthcare professional i could be. They base their name on integrity, transparency, solid research, and hard work. I held various titles and took on various responsibilities which only enabled me to grow as an individual. they have excellent training and their training does not stop after you are hired. they promote based on success and hard work and they truly put patients first."
good,"Great company but Intense culture - "
good,"Merck is a Good company, has great values. But it's difficult to work your way up into a promotion without having connections deeper within the company."
good,"In short, pharmaceutical sales reps are employed by pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors to inform physicians about their products. These reps help influence them to prescribe the drugs to their patients. They don’t make direct sales, and must rely on their interpersonal skills and knowledge of the products to sell their value to providers."
good,Empresa de clase mundial que exige máxima entrega pero ofrece grandes oportunidades de capacitación y desarrollo. Te enseña a ser líder.
good,"My managers and teammates were supportive and some of the best people I ever met. However, life as a Pharma Rep wasn't for me. The pharmaceutical industry is tumultuous so you never know when you may be out of the job."
good,Se nos otorgaban premios por ventas superior al estimado y esto generaba un acelerado en el logro de los objetivos
good,"Steady, consistent almost repetitive. Was contract labor for over two years without getting offered a full-time position. Enjoyed most of the people I worked with. Some parts of the jobs that I did were very repetitive. Supervision and management were minimal. Even though I had a great work ethic and good attendance, I was disappointed that I was not offered a full-time position"
good,Company that puts people ahead of profits.  Solid institution that has a global presence and fierce desire to truly work to improve the overall health of everyone.
good,"I was a temporary employee at Merck, very much enjoyed my time there.  If permanent position had come available I would not have left.  Great work/life balance at the Wilson site."
good,Good company to work for but not a lot of growth opportunities in finance.  US Controller org is very flexible and had a good leadership team.  Compensation was not great.
good,Merck is a good place to work and is very focused on bottom line results. They were very transparent when communicating organizational changes. They have a centralized technical support model that fosters consistency around the world.
good,"The company is one of the largest in the world and it feels like it in many different aspects. Great benefits and 401k matching, but bottom line in production is producing for the shareholders."
good,"Good environment work place, excellent management, safety place, variety of opportunity to development as a professional in your area or other areas. Recommended.."
good,Working here you can passionately feel that you are making a difference in the lives of countless people and their families.  Employees are appropriately compensated and there are opportunities to ensure you have the work-life balance you need.
good,What we do is great. Work could be better with better culture which require improvement. Career development need to be practiced more. CEO and management are focused and execute according to plan.
good,Company has a strong culture overall. People are proud of the company and strongly support the CEO on the whole. Only issue is company hierarchy makes upward mobility more challenge.
good,"Great Job, have to be very meticulous on the day to day activities to ensure RFT is applied. Lots of training and great Safety culture. Lovely people and everyone very helpful if you get stuck."
good,"An atmosphere where everyone works together for the common goal.  People are friendly and willing to help. Physical activity is encouraged for all employees, contract and full time members."
good,"Une journée de travail typique, prendre des commandes"
good,You are accountable for you role and held to your performance objectives. Fast paced with expectations to complete all projects on time. Responsible for your category.
good,It was a miserable experience and I am glad to be free.  It only looks good from the rear  view window.  It does not teach.  The culture is mean.  There is no help or support.  The hardest part is feeling all alone.
good,"Overall experience was great! The pay wasn't the best in the industry, but it was good. Good benefits. Pension. Good 401k match. Company car. Good amount of vacation time. Good work/life balance. "
good,"All staff respected, enjoyed training sites on protocols, learned a lot from management and medical staff. Good communication in the department I worked, multiple opportunities for advanced learning."
good,"Worked here as a temp for a year.  They have no intention in hiring permanently however, the exposure and title from working here may advance you towards permanent positions."
good,"I made a comfortable living working for Merck, especially for a recent college graduate, however, the demand on my time, body and health did not outweigh the paycheck. It was not uncommon to work 48-72 hours a week with an average work day of 12 hours. Rotating between day an night shifts became an added requirement due to department wide downsizing. If there was opportunity for career advancement and training a career path would have been possible, unfortunately, the greatest benefit of working for Merck was the pay."
good,"During 15 years, I have learned the working skill, process management, team organization, leadership skill. I improved much from my working experience."
good,"Experienced workforce, vested product/project expertise over a wide variety of SME's.  Collaboration is good across boundaries, but overall work environment is just average.  Enjoy interacting across multiple areas of the business.  Often struggle with finding supportive managers that really work to connect with their direct reports."
good,Great manager but US corporates made all the decisions with no consideration for the people involved and the work put in to get project up and running.
good,Buena empresa de innovación sin embargo ya no hay oportunidad de planta para areas administrativas
good,"I have been with Merck for 12 years and I enjoyed working for the company. Good pay, benefits a decent work environment, many changes. I recommend Merck as a place to work."
good,ich war 3 monate bei merck und habe in dieser zeit viel gelernt. ich kann das unternehmen weiter empfehlen
good,"Too much changed in the culture - what was once an awesome place to work became a place that you just no longer wanted to be at."
good,Très bonne équipe du département de la documentation avec une bonne entre aide
good,"The only issue with this company is job security due to their history of lay-offs and reductions in staff. Otherwise, the overall environment is pleasant, and the work is challenging and plentiful."
good,"Not a place to advance.  Opportunities were few.  Average yearly pay increases were less than cost of living increases.  Great benefits.  "
good,Restructuring continues and the sales organization is a shambles with no position power internally. The only promising area is oncology and they are more likely to hire from outside than from within to fill those positions.
good,"es una excelente empresa, pero la mayoria de sus empleados no son directos"
good,Merck is a large pharmaceutical company that is struggling to figure out their long-term plan in primary care because their existing pipeline has been lacking innovation.  The management culture is one of high expectations with a goal of paying for performance.  The company places a high value on compliance and doing things the right way.
good,Management took great care to create a great work/life balance. Work was demanding but not overwhelming. Goals were achievable. Mistakes were not the end of the world. Great learning experience.

good,Merck is a great company but downsizing every year due to poor pipeline and managed care contracts . The environment is very stressful and work life balance is very poor but compensation is fair
good,"Merck reminded me of a Government entity to some degree, with the exception that poor business practices were replaced with rich ones. Most of us have to pay taxes and most of us want to go to heaven but none of us wants to die."
good,"Good work environment, a company that looks for improvement constantly"
good,"Private company, you handle a lease 40% of the public. lot's of good people who works there, also it's a opportunity for advancement for a better position at Merck."
good,Just be yourself and always stay positive what ever comes your way.. learn from your mistake. Be patience and dont let your pressure be the reason of your fast decision always think carefully.
good,"marketing field was good but needed support from top management to visit new customers, overall a great learning place in field of biochemistry an hematology analyzers etc."
good,"Empresa conservadora, com um departamento financeiro muito forte tanto no Brasil quanto na Matriz. Entrei nesta empresa para trabalhar  2 meses como temporario e fiquei por 16 anos..... passando por duas implantaçoes de sistema completo da empresa como Key User(Usuario Chave)  A parte mais dificil era quando tinha que fazer as avaliaçoes dos colegas e tinha que ser de acordo com a gerencia. A parte mais agradavel era quando tinha que ensinar os colegas e participar dos progetos. O atendimento as auditorias da KPMG e Alemanha tambem eram gratificantes."
good,"Apesar da empresa estar iniciando no mercado de genéricos, através do meu networking consegui bons resultados."
good,Great experience with immunno therapy and working in team setting. The territory was a great fit to my clinical expertise and relationships.I would recommend the experience.

good,"World wide company known for its pharmaceutical and veterinary services.  A great company to work for with great employee emphasis.  "
good,I made sure the clean rooms were clean/sterile for the next business day.  I learned that working in a clean area could mean life and death if things are not done following procedures.  The hard part of this job was to make sure that no one entered the areas once they were cleaned.  I enjoyed working with my fellow team members and learning parts of there jobs.
good,Good culture with a very friendly and helpful management team. Management was helpful. Not much responsibility was given to the co-ops. High stress environment.

good,"Even tho I loved working at Merck, they were unorganized. There was always learning opportunities. As well as the opportunity to grow within the company. The only reason I am not working there now is due to a big layoff."
good,"Working closely with the doctors doing surgical and clinical procedures. While doing blood draws, injections, checking vital signs among various other in office duties."
good,"The work day was challenging and busy, but satisfying and rich knowing that the medicines we were developing could one day help real people.  The work environment was friendly and collaborative. There were also gatherings throughout the year to share success, collaboration and friendship."
good,"I was an Admin. Assoc. for the Clinical Research Dept.  My typical day would be to help out the other Medical Programmers and my boss, one of the Directors of the Clinical Research Dept.  My department was very fast paced and I loved that environment.  Everyone got along and we all helped each other.  The hardest part of the job was when a assignment was due asap.  It could be very nerve wrecking to finish your project on time.  The best part of the job were the people in my department.  My boss was very knowledgeable and always willing to answer any question I had."

good,When I worked for Schering Plough I had an excellent experience with the staff and my co-workers. We worked as a team and I learned leadership skills that help us overcome any given task.
good,Merck is largely a primary care organization and buts up internal barriers to getting things done quickly in the interest of customer value. Speed does not have to mean unethical nor wrong and the evolving competitive landscape requires adaptation which is more troublesome in a large organization.

Management was very strict and made sure that orders were done right. Most of the co-workers were very nice and willing to help. The hardest part was trying to get along with someone that didn't like people from the south. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning about the different kinds of meds.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is having a chance to help doctors improve their patients' lives.
good,Working at Merck requires a lot of flexibility and patience as the site develops and grows to its full potential.  Overall a good company to work for.

The hardest part of the job is working against the clock because our product is time sensitive. However, that is also the most rewarding and enjoyable part of the job. My coworkers and I have adapted to the challenge of an active work environment. As announced in the news recently, Merck has decided to lower their workforce by 20%, and therefore that included management in my department. This means there are more responsibilities for myself and my team to take part in at work."
good,Professional environment to work. Great experience to take forward this experience to next level.
good,"Stability testing of product currently out to market.  Valuable experienced gained in conducting assay, degradates/related substances, dissolution, Karl Fischer, and loss on drying testing.

good,"trabalho atendedo produção e realizando preventivas, desenvolvendo trabalho em equipe"
good,"The position I was in the last 15 years at Merck was an extremely busy position. Confidentiality, efficiency, ready to switch gears at a moment's notice were all a part of the job. All of my co-workers were as dedicated to their jobs as I was. It seemed to be how all of the Merck employees came to their job every day."
good,"I have learned so much over in merck like how to tackle the situations, how to be friendly with the colleagues,"

good,Constantly expanding and reorganizing organization structure and objectives. Predicted stability in 2013.
good,"É bom trabalhar com os produtos deta empresa, são inovadores e eficazes. Os clientes respeitam muito os funcionários e no geral confiam em seus produtos. Trabalhando em MSD, aprendi que tenho condições de criar e tomar decisões. A direção atual não reconhece muito bem as pessoas, mas no geral ainda é um bom lugar para se trabalhar. Os colegas são muito colaborativos e dinâmicos, porém muitos estão estenuados. A parte mais difícil é entender as decisões do comite executivo. A parte mais agradável do trabalho é o dia-a-dia e as pequenasw conquistas diárias. Os comentários acima se aplicam a fase pós-fusão (2010), sendo que a empresa está em fase de consolidar uma nova cultura, a qual para os ex funcionarios MSD está mais difícil."
good,supporting one of the busiest groups within the company (medical chemistry) allowed me the opportunity to grow and expand within the position. It allowed me daily challenges that I would over come and feel empowered by. I enjoyed learning different computing systems such as SAP and other data entry programs.

good,I was exposed to challenging opportunities to implement break-through end-to-end sourcing strategies in the Indirect Procurement area both as a people manager and an individual contributor.
good,"Worked as a coop student, the science and the scientists were great. Atmosphere and culture seemed to be very competitive as opposed to cooperative."
good,This company is very strict on who they hire and how deeply they prepare reps before going out into the field. They have very high expectations of how you will preform from day one. This helped me prepare for the rest of my career.
good,I have thoroughly enjoyed working there. It was a very positive time and I learned a lot and worked with some very talented colleagues.
good,Flexible work schedule makes it a doable work-life balance employment. Supevisor was excellent and mentored in a very professional manner. The hardest part of the job was scheduling all the research efforts of the day and getting them accomplished in a certain time limit. The most enjoyable part of the job was the colleagues interaction and sharing research findings.

good,"Fast paced, challenging work environment. Never a dull moment."
good,Great benefits and work environment that is focused on both producing lifesaving products as well as employee development
good,Reasonable ability to move up and succeed. Great place to grow and prosper along with others in the oncology field. Fair amount of autonomy across regions.
good,Fair compensation and benefits.  Little advancement in primary care due to the lack of pipeline compounds to replace the blockbusters of decades past.
good,"It is a great place to work if you are not in manufacturing.  The DuPont schedule is tough to deal with and at this facility.  Equipment is in dire need of replacement- the maintenance staff is seriously overwhelmed and little seems to be done to alleviate the problems. Benefits are outstanding, however.  The support staff is hard to get a hold of after hours (for the most part), and advisors are treated poorly."
good,"Overall good company culture and pretty good benefits.  They still offer a pension plan and annual bonus to perm employees."
good,"The most important thing for me was my work team and the work environment that we created to be able to work harmoniously."
good,"Empresa global com bons benefícios Além disso, ótimos profissionais interessandos em ajudar."
good,"Generally speaking, Merck is a great place to work. Job security depends largely on your department. Over the last 10 years, there has been more focus on acquisitions, as well as cutting transactional roles, which have been largely shipped off to India."
good,The constant push to do more with less has become more than most research people can handle.  The threat of out sourcing is pushing scientists and engineers to dry lab.  I'm not sure what else to say.
good,"I went to work at Merck because I had been in Pharmaceuticals previously.  But my hopes and hard work did not get me a permanent position. I was very disappointed, plus I did not have any benefits."
good,Quiet layoffs of temps while temps trained their replacements on the way out. Great place to work but never know when a layoffs is coming. Hard to go from temp to perm. People are nice and safety is a must as far as holding a rail while walking on stairs
good,"Great experience for the first 6 years prior to the shift in culture.  Once the merger between Schering & Merck took place, there were quite a few managers who lacked the most basic skills but were promoted due to the number of years with the company"
good,Lots of talented people. You’ll work hard but learn a lot and be compensated fairly.  Main drawback is layers of approval necessary to get things done.
good,I was very happy working at Merck.  I was valued for my expertise.  Always felt safe in the culture and had great managers.  I was with Merck for 15 years until I was laid off.
good,"Bei Merck zu arbeiten war in meinem Bereich sehr gut."

good,"excellent entrance into my pharmaceutical career"
good,"It's been over 10 years since I last worked at Merck, and much has changed since then, just as it did during my tenure there.  It's difficult for me to comment on anything current."
good,"I was at Merck as a contractor, so most of the opportunities available to permanent employees was not available to me. Therefore, I cannot comment. Contractors were brought in to do a job and nothing else. When then job was completed, the contract was completed."
good,"I was only a contractor at Merck, however this place provided a great working culture, amazing people, and the job was enjoyable to go to everyday. A lot of help is provided."
good,"Was part of team from company that was bough out.  Huge pay disparity between co-workers working in same job side-by-side."
good,Managers are professionals. Not required to stay full day. IT supports are not great. Technologies are not up to date. workplace culture is the best for who like diversity.
good,"Excellent benefits but poor management at site level.  Did not promote / assist all employees.  "
good,"Na época em que trabalhei na empresa (2011) ela se destacava por oferecer salário e benefícios diferenciados. "
good,"I liked working there . Liked my managers and co -workers .We did not get paid a lot but was still a good job . If they did not close the doors , I would have had to find another jog anyway due to very low salary"
good,The Company makes a
good,"To succeed in Merck you will need to take full ownership of your work and be passionate about it."
good,"Many hours on the computer, excess reporting, but not atypical of BIG pharma. Health benefits very good. Products were among best. Strong pipeline.  Strong support/resources to aid in the field."
good,"Merck is a good company to work for.  Recently, especially since the merger with Schering Plough, Merck has been going through numerous organization change and lay offs, which have caused the company to lose a lot of great talent.  Merck is a prestigious company to work for and has great potential."
good,i learned a lot  about vaccines and how it can save your life all the info they provided really helped im my perfomance on the floor the sop really help if you pay close attention the job can be very helpful if u really read your sop when u have too
good,"Providing advanced administration support to the technical team "
good,Working at Merck runs at a fast stressful pace.  The upside is co-workers are quite cultured. The highly competitive workforce do not generally exhibit a collaborative penchant for one another.
good,"Mesmo como contratada terceirizada, sempre fui tratada como se efetiva fosse e tive oportunidade de realizar desafios de implantar uma base de artigos científicos sobre os produtos da Merck para atender aos profissionais de saúde que ligavam no SAC. Também implantei no site do SAC um Serviço de Referência personalizado a estes profissionais para fornecimento de bibliografia sobre os temas que desejam pesquisar. Foi uma grande oportunidade na minha carreira!"
good,Merck is a progressive company that is research based. There is opportunity for growth but  a very competitive environment.  Opportunity is there for individuals who have good networking skills and a competitive disposition.
good,The environment is empowered; however it is difficult to advance on hard work only. It can be difficult to work in the environment when it runs as lean as it does sometimes. Lots of hours on the floor.
good,"Tipical work day starts reading emails,checking to see if any issues are open to be worked on or is an open status.Reviewing to see if any PMs or calibration work orders need to be completed.If issues or work orders need to be completed I will complete as soo as posible."
good,Good work life balance. Nice working with talented people. Working on challenging projects can be tough but satisfying. Exciting pipeline. Company standards and values. The company supports many outside organizations to help make lives matter. They also surpass expectations year to year
good,"Empresa muito boa, bons salários, os benefícios também são bons, mas investe pouco no desenvolvimento do funcionário,o volume de trabalho as vezes fica insano, mas no geral é uma boa empresa."
good,"Buena empresa comprometedora, pero pocas posibilidades de continuidad laboral"
good,Azienda dove ho imparato a gestire il personale e la discrezione
good,"I learned the insights of the sales department, how they measure themselves against the competition,  how to improved sales in one sector of the country"
good,A typical day at Merck consist of working with team members that all want to be on the same page by looking out for each other in safety. I love coming in and taking notes from some of the workers who have been there for years. The hardest part is having to live up to expectation on second shift but its difficult because of the lack of staff on second shift. I love the hours which is 10 hours a day from Monday to Thursday. The management at Merck is very encouraging. I learned that hard work and determination will take you very far in the long run so never give up or become discouraged if things don't work out the first time
good,"Great salary and benefits.  Very large company.  Good employees and lower, mid management.  FDA can have a lot of influence on programs."

good,"Great company to work for, especially those with families when they need the flexibility to work remotely when necessary.  The only concern is the job security with pharmaceutical companies, we had great leaders in Charlotte and they did their best to save as many jobs as they can."
good,ok.  not current there tho.  things have changed.  don't know if it even exists anymore  Lots of different areas to work in.  missed the patient contact--all front end and no people~!
good,"Trabajar en Merck es un privilegio, no solo por la industria tan poderosa en la que está inmersa sino además por la calidad del talento humano con que cuenta la compañia. Todos los días son llenos de nuevo aprendizaje; dentro de las multiples tareas a las que se puede ver enfrentado uno siempre encontrará nuevas personas y nuevo conocimiento que considero elemental y crucial para el crecimiento profesional y personal con el que cuenta cada persona. Aprendí a manejar el tiempo, a asumir grandes responsabilidades que incluyen altos costos, a el contacto con  nuevas personas, el ver como se desarrolla el negocio en la industria, a planificar y ejecutar grandes proyectos y a ver las cosas desde varios puntos, ya sea como administrativa o como personal de ventas."
good,Essendo una multinazionale da la possibilità di vivere in un ambiente stimolante e sempre in continua evoluzione; colleghi molto preparati e pronti ad affiancare le nuove risorse.
good,"Merck has been an enjoyable place to work. I have been involved in it's early stages as a start up facility which has been challenging and rewarding. I have been able to advance through my career from technician, to Lead, to Manager in 2 years. It has been exciting to see the growth of the company and my own personal growth but what has set me back is the poor decisions made by upper management. I have started to see a decline in moral throughout the plant and it is affecting the performance of the technicians. My hands have been tied as a manager and I have not been able to manage my team effectively, rather I am forced to manage my team from upper management. The most enjoyable part of my job as a manager is seeing the progress of my direct reports advance through their career. I have had the opportunity to witness amazing growth from my direct reports. Seeing them advance through the technician pathway, receive promotions from Associate Technician to Technician to Senior Tech to Lead Tech has been some of my greatest accomplishments."
good,"Empresa maravilhosa na hora de contratar, no entanto, não tive sorte com o meu gerente, apesar de eu trabalhar, ganhar prêmios e cumpri minha meta, fui demitida com 5 meses sem a possibilidade de trocar de gerência ou função.

good,"Morning emails to address issues and questions from the biologist.  Prepare samples for scheduled testing to be shipped out external and international. Communication is extremely important. Not everything went as planned and coworkers were a great help but some thought they're work was more important than others. Management was not very helpful but they tried but often times took on more work to make themselves look good but never asked for our input. Dealing with the struggle to try and get out and finished time sensitive testing including answering questions, helping with software issues and maintaining consumables. Getting projects done and knowing that we pulled together as a team."

good,"Execute the department operations required to produce the varicella vaccine. "

good,"Productive work environment with satellite work stations, amble meeting facilities.  Parking is usually a premium but the company provides shuttle services to nearby trains and cities."
good,Merck goes by the 2-2-3 schedule and I feel that helps with outside life. I enjoyed working 12 hour shifts and being able to also work third shift. I think it's an excellent job for anyone who wants to work long shifts.
good,"Ardua labor administrativa, buen ambiente de trabajo, constancia en cursos"
good,"rien a dire de plus sur Merck, le boulot est intéressant"
good,Robust pipeline and strong strategy. Very Mission oriented. Good work-life balance and opportunities for career development. Corporate stewardship is well managed.
good,Good company. Good people. A little too much bureaucracy but not unusual for a large pharma company. Animal Health division is a bit of an outlier so sometimes you don't feel like you are a part of Merck. But still a strong division with good talent.
good,Merck provided opportunity for growth and career development. The environment was very family oriented and welcoming. I enjoyed my career here at Merck.
good,"Got to work there for a short time and then bam! Everyone laid off. The job culture and people were excellent. Safety was number one priority. Sad they did this to us without any notice whatsoever. Here one day, gone the next."
good,"I tried bring up this issue with my management and I was told by one person that she has been here for over 19 years and there is nothing I can do, that is just her personality.  I spoke with another management individual and I was told that I needed to sit down with her and talk it out.  Which you can't do with someone who is always condescending.  I have not enjoyed my stay."
good,"Merck needed Schering-Ploughs pipeline and tax structure to become more successful.  They allowed those needs to blind them to the baggage that came with the merger.  "
good,"It  had great perks but the job security is not dependable. Cafeterias were great, the company store was amazing.  All products produced by Merck were extremely discounted, and there were other amazing perks.  The only bad thing about this job was the high layoffs that were going on."
good,"I was an intern so my time was short with Merck Animal Health."

good,"Good Company to work for but I was part of an acquisition"
good,"Merck was a great place to work.  Management at the time was more self-centered rather than focus on the employees success. "
good,"Non-stop from start to finish and then some!  Start by checking email, preparing daily schedule and meeting folder for SVP including background materials. Respond to emails, requests for meetings, reschedule to accommodate time sensitive meetings. Catch SVP for urgent questions and priorities.  Look forward in the week to ensure all logistics are in place for offsite meetings and that background is in place for upcoming meetings.  Ensure preparatory meetings are in place for upcoming reviews."
good,When meeting with co-workers or clients it was nice to walk to their office for the meeting instead of conf calls.   The layout of the office building also afforded opportunities to pull in periodic walks to help clear your mind or promote thinking of ideas.
good,"I really liked the products and felt proud working there."
good,"Pharmaceutical industries are always experiencing merges, where the management influence & affect in motivating and sustaining the talent employees is extremely important. In Merck, had experience to meet my role model manager, who remain my reference in any challenge related to anything going forward, even outside the work."
good,"Merck, a bio-pharmaceutical was a great place to work. The production of innovative health products, would include and improve people's lives everyday.

good,Merck is a good place to build a career.  Lots of opportunity to gain experience and have positive interactions with other colleagues.  Wishing only good things for the company and its people.
good,"Merck is one of the biggest companies in the pharmaceutical industry. The workplace culture is awesome. I learned customer management, negotiation skills and strategic planning."
good,The working conditions at Merck were very good.  Company integrity and moral compass is good.  Sales in the Pharma industry has changed focus over the past couple of decades driven by a more controlled cost environment created by third-party payers.
good,Nice work environment. Great opportunities to meet new people. You are always driving around and you are not stock in a office. Its the kind of job I will recommend to a young person.
good,"Managen van werknemers, overleg op Directors en Executive level en specifieke speciale inkoopprojecten. Tevens multidisciplinair overleg in werkoverleg en inkooptrajecten."
good,"Great company to work for! Smart people in leadership roles, great benefits, great culture. It's a company, which provides a career, not just a job. Advancement opportunities available."
good,I was well organized.  I had my days and weeks planned in advance.  I learned a lot about biologics and enjoyed the job.  Working at Merck was one of the hardest positions I had but one of the most rewarding.  I enjoyed the ability to improve patients' lives.  The company culture was warm and friendly.  The work/life balance was stressed by the upper echelon.  I loved the job and loved working for Merck.
good,"I liked my team and direct line manager however, typical cronyism and politics from upper management kept contractors from converting and other permanents from advancing.  Not all departments are the same.  If you are not a chosen one, just be happy where you are.  "
good,"A typical day at work was fun,enjoyable"
good,Merck has great people.  Everyone is trying to do the the best they can for the organization. Where Merck has fallen off in recent years is FDA approvals.  This has made it impossible for the organization to maintain staffing levels it once did.
good,Prior to sales force reduction. Enjoyed the ability to provide medicine and patient education to help healthcare providers provide quality care to their patients
good,"Merck had a company full of smart people.  At times, I found the culture cut-throat and competitive.  I was well-compensated and learned a lot while I was there."
good,"A Merck é uma boa empresa no geral, o salário é bom, os benefícios são bons.  Perdiam muito tempo com reuniões e muita burocracia que acabavam atrapalhando o trabalho técnico."
good,Merck was a good place to work with good people to work with.  The pharmaceutical world is changing. Merck's pipeline is weak and doesn't have promising products to carry them.
good,Très bonne société avec beaucoup de moyens.
good,"A person can obtain all of the skills needed for progress depending on the position and management.  The ability to have work/life balance also depends on management as well.  Currently, my co-workers are great!  Management/Supervisor is great also."
good,"ambiente stimolante , che ti porta a crescere lavorativamente"
good,It a solid company with good products. Fast paced environment and great colleagues. Merck went through a large downsizing roughly 50% and is postioning it self for the future of PHarma.
good,"The most enjoyable part of time at Merck was working with great people, who are truly trying to put Patients First.  Generally, colleagues treat each other with respect and are willing to collaborate, mentor, and help one another to acheieve a common goal."
good,"Great Pharmaceutical Job for any living area and any disease state, such as Oncology, Vaccines, Diabetes or Respiratory. Also have an Animal Health Division."
good,Merck is a very good place to work for mothers. It provides work-life balance and many development opportunities. Many opportunity rely on area one works in.
good,Merck has been a very enjoyable place to work. I have been offered many benefits and have been compensated well for my very high performance. Would only consider leaving Merck in a lay off situation.
good,"At Merck we have been trained on every sales model possible."
good,When I worked at Merck it was about 17 years ago.  We had a large and very functional learning and development group that served the sales and marketing function.  We worked in a new and beautiful learning center where sales reps and their managers came from all over the country to train on selling skills and therapeutic area knowledge.  It's not like that anymore.  Learning has become centralized and the learning center has closed.  Much of the learning is online.  I don't really know much about the current culture.
good,"A company with a stellar reputation for research and a high sense of integrity.  Impeccable upper management."
good,"Treats employees well, fun work environment. Learned a lot about business flows in and out of data management. Would recommend to another who is seeking to grow in a professional, caring workplace."
good,"Enjoyed the work and culture. Unfortunately the plant was small with no turn over which created the good ole boy network. This was over 10 years ago and culture may have changed since. Looking back though Merck was good for my family and me. There during Vioxx recall. Long term wise, back then it looked like they would just adjust percentages of chemicals, change patent to renew timeline and spin out a new product with mucho advertising dinero until you swallowed it. IMO"
good,"Merck is a good to place to work especially when you are a permanent employee. The management is flexible especially with parents."
good,Budgets are being cut and projects abandoned. Great co-workers and sense of family. Work life balance is excellent for individual contributors; management must stay late.
good,"SOP Authoring & Reviews"

good,Working for Merck is the place you want to be if you want a high intensity job. A typical day for me is cleaning formulation and fill rooms. I learned how to work with different personalities and lead a team.
good,It was a good company to work at and have a good presence in the pharmaceutical market. At the same time the working culture is also good learning enviornment.
good,Good company to move within the same plant site or across plant sites if you work hard . Constant movement of management can make things difficult.
good,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my time with Merck.  I just wish the promotion opportunities were better. The culture has improved tremendously over the past 5 years.  It is truly an environment in which it is safe to speak with courage and candor."
good,"Merck is a Global Pharmaceutical company."
good,"There's a distinct difference between career path and development.  Merck provides plenty of opportunity for development, both personally and technically, but the structure does not allow for a clear career path.  It's feed-forward - those who are promoted to leadership positions are often quickly promoted further without accomplishing much in the initial position.  Breaking through to a management role requires luck and location, and a little skill."
good,"As a sourcing manager a typical day at work includes follow ups to sourcing plans, meetings with stakeholders and the global procurement management committees, participating in sourcing events and or participating on non-sourcing related events/meetings with stakeholders providing support as a consultant. "
good,"Somewhat fulfilling place to work, with decent benefits. Advancement opportunities are few. Work is somewhat repetitive and not very challenging."
good,"Un réel effort de l'entreprise dans la mise en place d'outils et de méthodes de managmenet pour aider au développement de ses collaborateurs."
good,"Merck is in transition and there is a lot of ""reorganization"" currently underway. Internal communication within Merck is active, so people have a general idea of what's going on. But there have been many positions eliminated or moved to off-shore locations (i.e. out of the US)."
good,"Performance is the main goal for the company"
good,Empresa Dinâmica ambiente de trabalho onde visa o bem estar dos funcionários.

good,Demanding yet rewarding work.  Great work life balance and good benefits.
good,"Working at Merck means saving lives, especially at West Point where a majority of the products are vaccines. Depending on the area you work your typical day can be very different. West Point is one of the largest sites and includes research and manufacturing."
good,"Everyday Monday morning, I will have a phone meeting with my supervisor since she is based in Davao City and I'm assigned in General Santos City. We will discuss about the activities for the week and goal planning. After which, I will start visiting pharmacies to do product inventory and get orders. Then, my typical work set up would visit 15-20 doctors everyday except weekends. I have a very good relationship with my clients and also with my co-workers. We helped each other and talked on a regular basis. I considered my supervisor as my mom and best friend because I can ask for help at any time. I considered driving as the hardest part of my job since I have to travel 3-4 hours almost everyday. And the most enjoyable part of the work would be talking to different kind of people. I can be myself since I am friendly in nature that makes medical representative suitable for me."
good,Great company going through transformation.  Challenging time for pharma industry.
good,I learned a lot working here. This position really challenges me to excellent work. I have nothing but good thing to say. Great company if you are patient.

good,Merck is a great place to start a career. The company is very big and has many support groups with talented professionals who can help you learn the basics of the industry.
good,"Management not trustworthy.  Even though the company says there is a safe to speak up environment. Do not believe it! Had some great managers and had some non professional ones. Great managers = great culture, Bad managers = poor culture."
good,"Well organized with attention to detail in a high-pressure, fast-paced environment.  Identified as an individual who thrives on challenges, leads by example, and readily adapts to situations.  Self confident and poised in building and maintaining customer relationships across all business hierarchies."
good,Heritage company with 450 + years of age. Growth is sluggish with less pay.In house promotion not available.
good,I would recommend it but stay out of politics and enjoy your day to day!
good,"Una empresa estable con crecimiento en nivel de ventas. Con oportunidades de desarrollo laboral. "
good,Merck is a very good place to work but alot has changed in the culture since I started.  They are now focus on the bottom line only.  Because of the constant restructuring Merck employees are not as engaged as in the pass.  The smartest people I ever worked with in any company has been at Merck. The best part of the job is the people you work with at Merck.  Most employees have vast knowlege from what ever position they have held. Anyone that comes from Merck is very well versed in the area they worked or assisted.  Most people work in cross functional area's and get exposed to many parts of the business. There is many on-line offerings for training if you take advantage.
good,"Merck & Co., Inc. is a global health care company that delivers health solutions through its prescription medicines, vaccines, biologic therapies, animal health, and consumer care products, which it markets directly and through its joint ventures."
good,"Great company, really takes on the empowerment culture. Merck is going through a lot of changes, but what company isn't. Endless possibilities to continue to grow."
good,Great team implementation across many departments.  There is not way to be secured within the position working.
good,"Merck is a very structured and organized company at all levels. They believe IT systems are key in the sustainment of their primary core business functions. Many co-workers has the opportunity to work or participate in the development of such systems. Due to the organizational structure, sometimes, is difficult to move initiatives faster than usual. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with well prepared and knowledgeable partners. They make you feel you are learning new things all the time."
good,Medco provided me with the experience and development that shaped my growth. It was a really fast paced environment that demanded high productivity. Medco provided great senior management support and all the tools and technological support required to perform at a high level. Made some great friends and really became a skilled Supervisor in this setting.
good,"Merck ranks among the world’s leading pharmaceutical, chemical and life science companies."
good,"Have worked for a wonderful company until it was sold to another.  They are restructuring the company which lowers moral and success within your work area."
good,"Merck was a good company to work for over the past several years.  The culture was one of innovation and compliance.  You are encouraged to work with teams to ensure that projects are not only completed, but that the projects will have a major impact on the bottom line."

good,"Patients needs come first, great culture, security of job not the best.  I was laid off in Dec 2017 when the company laid off half of their sales force."
good,"Just wish Merck had transferred their laid off employees to a different department. Overall, I had a great experience and willing to fo back if the company will let me."
good,"Learning organization. Culture of excellence of execution, they just dont provide job to the right person, they give a career. Business ethics, Flexibility, Team work remains core values.Merck believes in innovation and research and development.Merck  believes in ""Medicine is for people,its not for profits,  profit follows if we have remember that ,they have never failed to appear..."
good,"Great salary, bonus and flexible hours for work/life balance. Work remotely from home and take time off when requested. Great Christmas party! Bring Your Child To Work Day was over the top! Well planned and done by employees. Also has an awesome on-site band comprised of Merck employees that plays at companies events!"
good,"Overall Merck is a great company to work for,  the salary is competitive and the people are great.  However when there are mergers and a lot of management and staff changes,  morale goes down."
good,"Culture was good with the exception of a one tech that was lazy, loud and started rumors. Coaches were cool and the environment was laid back. Job task were stressful at times but overall easy."
good,Great place to start in the pharma world the company is taking on new product which means there are more jobs to come. And they travel and you can advance even if it's at another site.

good,"My work day starts the night before I go to work.  I plan out my schedule to see as many Health Care Professional each day.  I would leave as early as 5:30 a.m. and work as late as 9:30 p.m.  This included making sales calls in a very brief moment and during long presentations at breakfast or lunch.  I had to manage samples, do expense reports and schedule speaker presentations for key providers. My immediate manager was super and the overall management team was effective.  Working independently was the most enjoyable part of my job and not having a good product that the health care providers trusted was the most challenging."
good,The company was bought out by Bayer I was working as Temp  for  manpower  after 1 year of employment the temporary staff was told that there would be no hiring of full-time permanent staff that year

good,Empresa que sempre valorizou o funcionário e sempre teve ótimos feedbacks da classe médica
good,"Good solid company with great work/life balance"
good,"An okay company with a pension, work life balance is fine. It is big pharma though so one should take into consideration the company culture in such a large company and also the pay grade."
good,"Workplace culture was decent. Micromanagement is very minimum.  Everyone is very dedicated to their project, and friendly. "
good,Merck is an exceptional company in terms of benefits and opportunities.  During my tenure the science was exceptional and employees were driven and motivated.
good,"this is a great organization to grow in career with Merck Ltd."
good,"Merck Pharmaceuticals is a multinational company , having research products which have results and good ratings in many products. its main focus is to trainned employee before going to doctor practices"
good,Empresa dinamica porem exige resultados em curto prazo
good,I do not feel comfortable reviewing Merck on a public website because I am not sure of the security of this site or the audience for this review. I have been employed at Merck for the last 18 years
good,I worked at Merck as a consultant more than 10 years ago and enjoyed working there. I think it is a good company to work for. Can't say much about the culture now.
good,I enjoyed working in all the different depts. It was neat to know how things were made. Can move up but being hired on full time is kind of difficult.
good,"Worked for Merck for twelve years.  My career Merck was accented year after year in term of knowledge, responsibilities and leadership.  From an Automation Engineer up to Computer System Validation Manager.  It was an excellent experience in a good work culture."
good,"Excellent company to work for.  I was a hired contract worker.  I wish I could have been hired permanently. On a  typical day, you are busy from start to finish of a workday."
good,"I was hired for 6 months but worked for 2 years, Merck has an internal policy of no more than 2 years for contract employees. They were in the process of downsizing."
good,Enjoyed my contract here.  Good work environment.  Good Management.  Very good co-workers.  Work was interesting and offered challenges.  Plenty of opportunities to learn and grow and for advancement.

good,I loved it because it was a good environment and you really help patients and provide them with the best and new knowledge in the market. Merck had one of the biggest R&D labs in the pharmaceutical field and it was a privilege working for them.
good,"Great place to work at overall. Above Average for work/personal life balance. Great, friendly culture and diverse group. Company allowed for growth and endless opportunities to learn new skills. hardest part is getting promoted and getting compensated well for it.  Felt underappreciated as an internal employee vs. outside candidates.  Company is willing to bring in outside talent and pay them more vs. someone whos been in the industry and committed time to company."
good,I was only at Merck for one summer and I felt like I was drinking through a fire hose.   There was so much going on it was really hard to get into my groove.  I enjoyed my time and it seemed like a nice place to work for an extended period of time.
good,"I enjoyed working there . I worked !2 hour shifts , on a 2-2-3 schedule . The Company culture was very uplifting .  My trainer made sure i was properly trained."
good,"I loved working for Merck, but the management was awful.  "
good,"Merck is a top place to work, with a driven culture to succeed. The employees are true pros, and accomplishing tasks is a given.  There are challenges to manage massive workload and maintaining a work life balance.  But in the end, your work makes an impact on health and saving lives.   Everyone feels that motivation."
good,"I really like the opportunity give here at Merck, my coworkers have been nothing but helpful and the pay is good.  The cons of my area are  that the day shifts do nothing compared to what nights do and nobody seems to care."
good,The reps and managers are unsurpassed at this company.  The training is excellent and highly scientific.  Unfortunately employees are completely expendable.  There is very little upward mobility if you are unable to relocate to the Philadelphia area.
good,This position was a rewarding job.  I was able to improve the lives of patients by discussing the benefits of immunizations for those that need immunizations and protection of those that cannot be immunized.
good,I always liked working for Merck. They offer great benefits and the work was challenging. I was laid off December 2013. I left Merck as a technician and have since progressed to manager of Department for CRO. I would like to return to Merck. Live closer to Merck and liked the hours worked and pay.
good,"Calling on primary care physicians in support of several therapeutic areas. Conducting breakfast, lunch and snack opportunities to have extended discussion with the physicians and staff. "
good,Productive fast paced environment.  Innovative.  New product development constantly ongoing.  Very competitive environment with advancement limited due to reorganization.  Great benefits.
good,I've been working for this company for 1 year and I have met only good colleagues working in a friendly and collaborative culture! I would totally recommend this company as a place to work to get a multinational perspective on pharmaceutical industry.
good,"Decent place to work. There are a lot of places to move about for growth. Lot's of very smart people making it a great place to continue learning while you work. That said, it is so large that it is easy to be overlooked which can mean being underappreciated. Also tends to  lack managerial support at times. There is some favoritism and hiring bias. But overall a good place to work."
good,"A typical day at work included:"
good,"I already provided sufficient information in prior questions."
good,13 years in sales.  Most recent manager was fabulous.  Not much room for advancement unless you relocate to HQ in PA.  Great products but not the most robust pipeline so the job security isn't great.  Just had a massive layoff in primary care.
good,"Great people, ethical establishment. Very proud to have worked for such a life changing company.  Corporate culture is very inclusive of all types of people."
good,"Good company, ethical in practice.  Generally market leader, history of solid performance and strategy with research basis.  Oncology and Diabetes current focus in markets."
good,"I have many years of customer experience. When I first started, I had no technical experience at all. I have learned a lot in regards to troubleshooting iPads and laptop issues. "
good,"I have been in my territory for basically 20+ years. I have wonderful relationships with my customers as well as coworkers. I love my manager. He challenges me and truly is a good coach. The hardest part of my job is dealing with our computers. They are ancient and it takes me twice as long to do something on the laptop versus what I can do on my iPad. Sales people waste half of their time on busywork."
good,"I was working in MERCK around 3 years ago. I was working there as a medical representative.I used to go to hospitals and present our products, mostly medicines, to specialists."
good,"I worked at the Elkton Site, and the politics were particularly thick. It was hard to advance there unless you were willing to nestle up to your manager. "
good,"My day consists of scheduling meetings for 6 departmental exec directors, and directors; international/domestic travel scheduling; videoconference and webex scheduling; preparing itineraries; backup admin to the SVC of the department.  "
good,"•	Build calls with purpose and continuity for, Specialist and hospitals dealing with  Diabetes "
good,"It was a temp position. The work was very informative and the management cared about the employees. however, I worked during a merger so cuts had to be made. Overall great experience."
good,"Working in a variety of setting with individual PCP's, group practices and hospitals to add value for patients, their providers and institutions.  Must be flexible and astute for market events and quick change."
good,Very competitive but a great place to work. Lots of opportunity but not a lot of good managers. Excellent benefits but expensive. Hard to keep a work-life balance.
good,Great company to work for. Left due to my commute. Company provides career advancement and opportunities for personal growth. The benefits are superior.
good,"Merck/Telerx Is a Great Place to Work, Plenty of Benefits Just have to know the right people. Must be able to work in a team environment and must be hungry for self-success."
good,"Excellent job experience. This was a really career adventure.  I achieved a good QA careers, starting as Auditor up to Head Compliance and Regulatory. I learned to work hard, with passion to the role. A challenged opportunity with continuous learning, including process improvement and professional improvement. I learned a lot about compliance, Quality Systems and Validation. Excellent  Quality and Technical Balance Workplace culture."
good,I have worked for Merck for over 10 years and feel it is time for a change. Merck is a high stress job but this makes your day go very fast. Work life balance will depend on the department and the individual you work for.
good,"Developed strong relationships with the people I dealt with and learned alot. Outside our particular nucleus in the facilities department, however, culture seemed lax as it seemed like people were always just walking around to waste time."
good,It is a very subjective company about their management people. It only evaluates according to one person opinion and are brutal when they terminate positions. The working force is good in general.
good,Seasoned sales and marketing professionals.  Tends to promote from within.  Minimal hiring from the outside deters innovation. Infrastructure not designed to support new hires.
good,"Management not focused on employees as team members and overlooks creativity, efficiency and growth opportunities. Moral improvement along with improved inclusion will result and the company may make more rapid advancement."
good,"Es un empresa con estrategias bien definidas, y hace partícipe a cada colaborador de ellas. Se trabaja conectados con el servicio al cliente, desde cualquier área funcional, nos apoyamos en el cumplimiento de los objetivos y crecemos profesionalmente, en equipo y de forma individual. La empresa es estable internacionalmente y con muchas fortalezas adquiridas de más de 100 años de experiencia. Lo más difícil del trabajo es el perfeccionismo con el que nos gusta ejecutar nuestras tareas, y comprender que a veces hay cosas que dependen de factores externos a nuestra cadena de valor. Lo que más me gusto de mi trabajo: la gente, y la capacidad de comunicar claramente lo que se quiere y como hacerlo mejor cada vez."
good,"Fast learning skills and lots of flexibility required, good managers support. I worked as a contractor for about two years, started as a tester on short term project at Amsterdam office than joined other project and developed my skills into data migration specialist."
good,Well structured global company with overall good benefits and development prospects. Very intersting and promising pipeline of innovative medicine. Important CSR secor globally.
good,"Merck is one of the oldest pharmaceutical mid size company in the world. Its a family business owned company in which i believe ,continued growth and empowerment of superior performance is the key to prolong its existence, stability and presence in the global market share serving its consumers and patient with most high quality products and medications. Its an eminent school to learn multinational standards and procedures in the day to day business operation. Merck bio pharma was an outstanding experience in terms   of business operation,career development and workplace culture having the right people in the right place while Merck Consumer Health suffered a lot of turbulences due to lack of incompetent Senior managerial team with cultural issues."
good,"Muy agradecida a Merck , es una gran empresa con grandes beneficios para los trabajadores"

good,"I think there are some really great people who work there."
good,I loved working as a pharmaceutical rep and brining valuable innovative information to healthcare professionals that can change the lives of how patients live.  Sometimes it offered cures to keeping children from asthma attacks to preventing hypoglycemia to elderly patients who were diabetic.  The hardest part of the job was coordinating with your co-workers so that a very planned and detailed business plan fell in place and was productive in being higher market shares.
good,"The team is the best, the culture and the place is unique. The management team is supportive, overall it is a great place to work"

I've learned the work industry can be very diverse and competitive and as for that I have to work even hard if I want to succeed and go up even farther in the corporate ladder. The hardest part of this job would be the constant clean up and change overs, going from one product to the next just to come back to the same product we began with from the start. This can cause some deviations due to the amount of time allowed for the changeover as well as personnel assigned to complete this task.

My experience at National Starch taught me work ethics, product formulation, and how to build relationships with customers.  At Merck, with the help of management and expert senior colleagues I learnt the whole process of drug formulation.  Over the 11 years at Merck, I helped take 2 animal drugs from discovery to formulation to  validation and commercial manufacture.  In addition, I also helped re-formulate certain commercialized drug products.  In this process, I learnt several  life lessons of how to  be a key component of a team.   To get a formula to  manufacture, it requires collaborating with several other groups including, Analytical, Packaging, Regulatory, Clinical and Regulatory.  This process brings about many challenges of its own and I have learnt that all the groups involved are looking for the same end result.  This underlying goal is what keep everyone focused and to resolve conflicts and ensure timely deliverables.  The management at Merck helped me grow as a Scientist and gave me  complete ownership of my projects.  This responsibility and encouragement made me focus and be proud of my work.  When you have great co-workers and a company that appreciates your work, it makes coming into work very exciting."

My coworkers were more then coworkers we treated other as a work family.

The manager makes or breaks the job when selling for this company. My first manager was very good and allowed each rep latitude to sell according to their style and quickly rewarded reps that increased sales. The second manager expected  reps to sell like he did in the past, often interrupting during conversations with Drs and requiring reps to use outdated and in my opinion, ineffective sales ""techniques"". Great company to work for if you have a good manager, if you get a bad one take your skills to another company, you're usually getting a promotion since Merck reps are highly regarded by industry competitors."

Some amazing scientific minds there, and others just check off boxes to get things done, the later tends to do better.  It is the only place some people have worked, and have been there for many years, which leads to an ""it's always been done that way"" mentality, and adapting change is slow.  I enjoyed going to work every day, and am glad for the experience."

I highly recommend them to other potential employees.
good,"I had a very good experience with Merck. The job was challenging and rewarding.

The corporate culture was fantastic and focused on people. There was still a culture of responsibility and accountability, and for the most part the team of people in my unit was first class. The hardest part of the job was the irregular hours and frequent travel, although that is certainly limited to those in the field.

I learned to work with a treatment team to develop treatment plans for a great group of children and young adults with autism and developmental delays. I was also fortunate enough to be able to put the treatment plans into action and make a real difference in the lives of these children. While some of the children had aggressive behavioral problems, which could make the position very challenging, the small improvements everyday was absolutely worth the frustration. The management and co-workers further reduced the frustrations of the job, as they were consistently working together, sharing strategies, and always wiling to go the extra mile to improve your mood when the job was upsetting."

You learn quickly as an Executive Assistant working for C-level management, that organization and always being one step ahead of your supervisor, will give you the necessary tools to be successful. Colleagues are always willing to lend a hand when needed and provide a wealth of knowledge. The challenges as an Executive Assistant are keeping up with the workload, but usually just a learning curve. The company has an amazing benefits package and growth potential."

good,"I really enjoyed many aspects to this job and was good at it.  Unfortunately, it was difficult to gain access to your targeted doctors.  Lots of gatekeepers and games.  I would buy lunch for 150 people and the doctor would not come and see me.  He would send his nurse to sign for samples so I would get credit, but it was all fake.  Then a manager shows up to ridealong with you and you have to pretend you normally have 20 minute conversations with these people.  I found it a lot like acting sometimes.  Eventually I found a Wine Sales position that I loved and left."
good,A typical day as a QC lab technician at MERCK can range from relaxing to highly intense. It is very dynamic. The work day is from 6:30-4:30 where the workers can come in for any 8.5 hours including the a 15 minute break and a 30 minute lunch. MERCK really focuses on its culture of helping each other and therefore everyone is nice and willing to lend a hand. MERCK compensates really well especially in the region and offers some of the best benefits packages available. The effectiveness of management is variable based on the level. The immediate manager within the department is very helpful but upper management is not quite as easy to reach. Overall MERCK is a great place to work and it provides one of best best workplace cultures on the east coast.

good,A typical day at work is to look for different opportunities to improve and to be more efficient. We need to do more with less so this mode guarantees us from keeping our company in the drug pharmaceutical business. Teamwork skills are very important to assure that everything we committed to complete is achieved. We are commited to be accountable and this is not possible in an individual way. I am currently being under development as the quality agent for the technical group and this is very interesting to me since I can apply my compliance and balance it with my technical background. i really appreciated this opportunity. Our site is unfortunately going through a Merck Network exit and  is expected to be sold this year (2014) or to close no later than 4th quarter of 2016.

good,"Have defined and structured process ."
good,"Fun place to work - nice people and great management. "
good,"No two days are ever the same.  There is no such thing as a typical day at work and I mean that in a positive way.  In any department, you will have multiple responsibilities that challenge you to learn, adapt and grow as a professional and as an individual.  One of my favorite things about working in the BCMT department is that they encourage you to step out of your comfort zone and learn more than just how to do your job.  Every year management has a meeting and evaluates how long you've been in a position and will look to see if you can benefit the company in a different role.  You're never stuck doing the same thing for years on end.  I learned a great deal about the different departments and how they play their part in the success of the business."
good,My current role I have learned a lot.  The work place is wonderful.  I am currently searching because I want a change in shift.  The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you are being part of getting medicine out to customers that really need it.

A typical day at the internship was going in and studying a group of employees and also studying each process in the production of claritin.

Employees interacting with us and telling us their experiences working with the corporation was the most enjoyable aspect of the project.

good,"Empresa excelente,vsu área de recursos humanos no te ayuda y solo te estresa, existe mucha burocracia y no hay apoyo de gerencias, ni tampoco capacitación no conocimiento de los procesos de la gerencia media y alta"
good,"Great company benefits and Outstanding CEO, but Merck @Elkhorn, NE is not about Diversity & Inclusion with people of color. People of color don't advance like Caucasians. I was hungry for advancement. I would help wherever I was needed. I could perform in any department, packaging, fill department, and maintenance. I got screwed on two 10% raises and was told by an Executive Administrator I should be happy with what I was getting because my last job was getting 25,000/YR. I was never told I made Senior, never received my recognition like every other Caucasian did or raise. But I would work on days off, holidays, even would go back to work during the nights on call to help when needed."

good,"As a long time and veteran employee of MERCK I have seen and experienced constant change over many years. Sometimes these changes are very good and other times changes come about in response to changing marketplace dynamics or due to new government regulations. For as large a size MERCK is they run very lean on the number of employees. The upside of that is that one has a lot of individual responsibility and personal and professional development become a part of any job at MERCK. The downside is that work/life balance does become a challenge because everyone at MERCK works had and long hours, often at some personal sacrifice. That's the difficulty in working at MERCK. But, in the end, it is a good place to work and you will never love more than all of the hard and important work you will do as a MERCK employee. It's the culture and everyone respects one another for that and many other reasons. The ""extraordinary performance"" at MERCK becomes the ""ordinary"" because of the huge talent pool of employees and Managers. Lastly, there has been indecisiveness from the top at MERCK on the future of Pharma in general and specifically the role of MERCK as the Affordable Health Cate Act is rolled out. As a result, the company is trying to hold back on any type of employee expansion and is keen on continuing to eliminate positions and/or employees wherever it can. This results in some decay of employee morale and stability for a future at Merck has become an employee concern no matter what level of performance one is doing in their job. Nothing is guaranteed at MERCK."

I guess you can say you are personally connected to each phase of each process which gives you a sense of Pride in what you do and what is going on in the Pharmaceutical world. While working at Merck you develop great  ""Family"" Relationships and everyone looks out for each other and is willing to lend a hand where needed.
