good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
bad,"The management abuse their authority acting as if they are above everyone, and treats their employees terribly. The schedules are horrific due to the the lack of turnover of employees. More than 10 people have left because of how poorly they were treated by the managers. They took advantage of some of the minors who worked there. The pay is low for how much money they make. The manager create a hostile environment as if your supposed to hate your job. If you’re looking for a job here it’s not worth the time or effort work somewhere where they will apperciate you and not make you feel less."
bad,"Unprofessional"
bad,"Don't work there. "
bad,"Enjoyed the high standard of expectations. The problem is they do not compensate you for the amount of work expected. Management is poor. Supervisors and all customer service reps are overworked and underpaid. The systems used to assist customers are not employee friendly and are constantly experiencing technical issues.You are constantly policed which makes you feel as though you are in a hostile work environment. For example, do not stand up, talk to your neighbor/co-worker and spend too much time in the bathroom."
bad,"If I could give it 0 stars, i would. The general manager is a racist and terrible with people. The managers and supervisors could only do the best they could under the circumstances. The company as a whole only cares about making money, no matter the consequences on their staff. No one enjoys working at Polo, but they pay good."
bad,"The management at Ralph Lauren in Texas city, Texas was completely horrible. From the new GM calling people ignorant and failing to meet goals, to customers complaining and unhappy with what our business was giving them. I’ve had multiple customers ask me the name of my mangers and wanting to make a bad review and ask me why I chose to tolerate the work place."
bad,"My main thing with this company is how majority of the managers are completely awful. Don’t get me wrong there are a few managers who are absolute diamonds but unfortunately the other managers let them down. They talk down to you, ignore you, get defensive when you try and talk to them about something, give you written and verbal warnings  just for the sake of it. There’s no encouragement, no team morale, everyone’s miserable working there, everyone wants to leave, no one gets taken seriously and unless you stand up for yourself you will continue to get walked all over. But if stand up for yourself then you get victimised. There is no progression of any kind unless you happen to be certain managers ‘favourites’ if you’re not their favourite then forget getting promoted because you definitely won’t. False promises are made. Just avoid this company unless you just want to be a pointless and overworked cog in the company machine. You also have to pay for your own uniform and get awful shifts (2-11pm).. if you want to work for Ralph Lauren then go to London or literally anywhere else. Avoid Bicester Village."
bad,The overall training of the Ralph Lauren was awesome the instructor was awesome when you get out on the floor Everything Changes they train you one way in the class but when you're on the phone they want you to do. Another way for instance tracking packages when you track the package and you know that that package has been received by someone but not . The customer supposed to send them up so they can get a refund but they don't want you to do that they want you to investigate first and then after 7 to 10 business days they'll get their money or they'll get a refund or they'll get notification from the return Department that's not what the customer wants to hear especially after they have already taken their money out of the account so a lot of things that I did that I learned in the classroom for the training it didn't help once you got on the floor
bad,"Myself and two other woman were sexually harassed by a supervisor while working for Polo Ralph Lauren. We should have taken action, however the management did not seem like a safe enough space to discuss the trauma with."
bad,"The management didn't have control of the establishment. They were forced to repeat the same script that they were probably taught and it seems that it's just some type of way for them to look like they're doing their job so their bosses don't get mad."
bad,"Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad and bad. Did I mention it was bad? Working long hours, very little pay, management was a joke, customers are vile and treat you like dirt."
bad,"Is a place were you have to fight for sales. They do not give uniform so you have to have the Ralph Lauren look. I bought 3 pairs of shoes and still were not enough. You cannot be yourself in any way you have to act and pretend everything is so false. My hair is wavy but the want it  poker straight like in the catwalks, so I have to came one hour before to straight my hair but was never enough. Thanks to Ralph Lauren I had to cut my long hair after using too much heat."
bad,i learned how to mange time and work efficiently and how to help dress and fit customers based on the occasion they are searching for whether it is a party or just to relax in at home
bad,I felt like the management at the company was out too get me because the other employer was wereing the same shoes that i was whereing and they told me not too where them and never told the other worker nothing not exceptable.
bad,Bij Lauren supervisor en managment het hele gedoe erom heen is nep. Beloven veel komen niks na.
bad,"I wish I could say, what I really need to say. They really need to think about people health and welfare, ahead of ""Peak Season"". No one gets any time off. And are threaten with termination if they take days off and/or complain about not getting time off."
bad,Polo is an OK place to work for someone who's in school and still living at home with their parents if your not a full time associate. I don't feel like they treat there temps accordingly! 😢 I don't like how during peak season they wanna pay you but as soon as its over they take the pay away!!!! They should treat us (temps) better because if it wasn't for most of us i feel like a lot of people would really have to work harder.
bad,Company speaks for it self . It’s the management. A girl asked about training during the interview and managers laughed and said no training is given . I’m personally a fast learner . Their response was so unprofessional I’m no longer interested because I can not work under that type of manager. That’s not real leadership. Just because You been with a company over 10 years means nothing if you don’t have the leadership skills. -Auburn Hills Location
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
bad,"Polo used to be a great environment that fostered independent thinking and synergy between departments.  Now however things have changed, unfortunately for the worse. Infighting and pettiness now flow through the building like if it were it’s blood. Feeding into a great black heart that recycles  that blood into animosity and paranoia. Truley a more stressful workplace you could never find. :("
bad,They did not care for the Adecco associates only there full-timers. We had different rules then the full-timers. Just was not a good place to work unless you are full time.
bad,"expect to do too much no work life to home life balance, District manager dosnt care about associates , hours at night would be past midnight at times and have no security"
bad,"Horrible left me with a bitter taste in my mouth working there. Lack of advancement opportunities, low compensation, no managerial accountability, and lack of professionalism amongst the managerial staff."
bad,"Varies at every location.  The eaton centre was particularily bad, bad clients, AWFUL management.  Never get breaks and not even allowed to drink water on the sales floor.  Very aggressive sales goals and catty environment only there are no incentives to sell, terrible pay, no commission, bad shifts, no benefits, and heavily micromanaged. Very bad work culture, one of the worst. Bad work life balance as the shifts are always changing and often management would not put out your schedule until the day before the week starts! very frustrating place to work where you dont feel valued and its very obvious from the extremely fast level of turnaround."
bad,"The managers are adults that act like children, the pay was horrible for 5 years I made minimum wage, during annual reviews they would always try to find a way to avoid giving you a raise. They would cut hours unless you were a favorite of the manager, some of the laziest employees would get 40 hours a week and would play on their phone all day and do nothing while hard working employees were only getting maybe 15 hours a week."
bad,"Too much drama and bad management, stressful environment for poor pay. No chance to move up in the company they tell you one thing then tell you another."
bad,"Je n’ai pas d’avis "
bad,One manager there treats the employees and other managers like their trash making them cry and even calling them stupid or mentally challenged and if they tell on him he calls them babies in front of everyone
bad,Literally the worst job experience that I've ever experienced. Management tries to conceal work related harassment. And in some instances management harassed their employees. Then they even harrass former employees. Management talks down to the particular employees if they don't like the person. Promotion is politically based regardless of how poor the work related performance is of the candidate in question. Unprofessional environment. Think twice about working here because they will chew you up and spit you out while Hiding behind the state right to work policy.
bad,"Basic retail gig, low to no hours, minimum wage, busy work. Lie to people to sell ugly clothes for extreme prices. When a pair of pants costs more than I make in a month...."
bad,"go work at lacoste it is a lot better. I hated working there the management sucked. "
bad,"Managment was horrible, did not respect their employees or customers. Got treated like a child. The store manager was a waste of retail time. Horrible."
bad,"I worked there almost 2 years have a bully supervisor there, they won't get rid of, I feel it's race, it's not a good company to work for anymore, sad"
bad,awful experience.  Management was poor and the overall work experience was not great.  Did not have proper training or support.  Would not go back to retail because of it.
bad,"The Expectation is that you need to drop your life and only work, Their is no consideration for family and life outside of work."
bad,"unpack and set up a new collection merchendise every week. Understanding the different trends that are changing everyday"
bad,I loved this job also i got along with all my co workers. The only problem was that i was at the time not getting enough hours.
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
bad,They always judge color and I don't like that. When you work hard they never praise you about it . That's why I left and joined the grocery store
bad,"Currently employed, I started when the store first opened, and at one point was super excited to come to work for this company. I started at the associate level with help from upper management that is no longer there, I was promoted, but as the company is changing, so are its leaders. The upper management now are all about numbers, and not the personal growth and development of lower class associates. The most enjoyable part of the job are the different types of customers that I've met these past 3 years. I don't feel as part of a team as I use to. The atmosphere at the workplace is horrible!"
bad,"Honestly, one of the word companies to work for. The other divisions seem okay, but kids was terrible. Would never work there again, killed any desire to work in Fashion."
bad,Was the easiest job I've ever had. Vary from fast to slow during the work shift. Great employees and enjoy working alongside of them. If short of work we were directed to another department which was simple work as well.
bad,High volume and multi cultural environment.  Outstanding Management team.  Best practices always in place for employee development.  Exposure to new technology and customer engagement.
bad,Stocked shelves for 8 hours worked hard for no job advancement
bad,"A typical day at work was working on two computers, that invoices were scanned into. You had to key in international invoices into SAP using the correct currency, invoice date, invoice number/vendor name. Very hard to read screens and understand invoices that were not from the USA."
bad,Awful place to work where they run through managers like toilet paper.
bad,"miła praca z miłymi ludźmi, w sklepie z firanami możliwość rozwoju."
bad,"Worked employees extra hard and wasn't so friendly. Always yelling at the employees, even in front of customers."
bad,"No upline communication with management"
bad,"Not happy at all with the company. There is a tremendous amount of preferential treatment with the boss. If the boss does not like you, she will treat and talk to you like her servant.  "
bad,I worked in a warehouse repairing children's clothing made overseas to meet US standards.
bad,glad i found another job...was ready 2 leave..tired of being a temp need something permanent that pays good
bad,The management team is unreliable. I did learn how to work well under stress. My coworkers work well together as a team and on their own. The hardest part of the job is the odd hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is fast work days.
bad,A great company to work for. Rather keep my commits to myself.
bad,"Salary is poor, you get paid way less than the amount of work you have to do. The company will try it's best to mess your pay up so they can cut costs, you are given terrible uniform, trainers that will give you a lot of pain."
bad,"No discipline, no senses of ownership,low pay,low hrs no benefits and no chance for a raise or grow7in the company ,and they dont do any training at all."
bad,Brutto non consiglio questo lavoro a nessuno orari scomodi
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
bad,Polo was not the job for me. I took it because I needed some fast money at the time. But I wouldn’t recommend Polo to anyone with a family trying to make it out here.
bad,"The worst place I have ever worked with poor, uneducated, unfair management. Schedule became available on Friday for the next week. FAVORITISM. Horrible, not helpful District management."
bad,"I worked here for maybe a month and hated it. Every time a black customer came in, they were followed or assumed to be stealing. I was the only minority within this particular store. I just find it disgusting that every non-white customer was continually watched or followed, and I was always told to ""keep an eye on them"" because they were assumed to be stealing. The only reason I believed that management did not say anything inflammatory to me was because I am in law school and they knew."
bad,The company was not fair to all employees and especially if the where from different ethnic groups. They were not great on annually raises. Giving you 12 cents annually was horrifying.
bad,Management doesn't work well with each other. There is zero talent development. Low pay and the associates do all of the work while the managers sit in the office and act like the store doesn't exist.
bad,"ambiente lavorativo non stimolante e senza crescita, sopravvalutando alcuni soggetti ripsetto ad altri tenendo conto solo della simpatia e non dal lavoro svolto (es.gente con il diploma diventata manager e gente competente non considerate ; pausa caffè, alcuni possono fare diverse pause senza nessun richiamo mentre ad altri anche con una sola pausa vengono richiamati)"
bad,as a cashier you will have to take orders and well serve them. and always suggest what the customer should get if asked. answer any questions they might have whats on the burger.as well clean up lobby. sweep and mop and throw out garbage.
bad,Management favour people and let them get away with not doing what they should be doing and then pulling others up when they are doing things correctly.  Lots of people talk behind each others' back and complain about each other.  Managers encourage people to raise complaints.  A very toxic place to work.
bad,"I have never worked with worse managers in my life. They made it very clear that they didn’t care about my advancement and only set me up to fail. They literally do the bare minimum, sometimes not even that. I woke up every day wishing that I hadn’t because this job was so awful. The pay was terrible, too, and those on my team who received raises only saw a 1% increase. You will not feel appreciated at this company. Ever ."
bad,"Do you like being able to schedule events with family or friends? Do you like being able to know when you work at least a day in advance? Do you enjoy knowing what time you're liable to start? If any of this is the case, get work ANYWHERE ELSE. Imagine having to call in at the same time every day to figure out whether or not you need to get ready to work in about 2 to 3 hours. If you're imagining this, and you're a normal human, the thought should be absolutely miserable. That's what it's like. Don't bother asking when you think you'll get off, because it'll be nothing but vague ""i'unno""s from everyone who SHOULD have some idea. "
bad,Don’t do it. They use you when they can when work gets low temps are the first to go during major holidays we worked from 4am to 3pm 10+ days straight no days off. Keep track of your hours and watch your checks. You can work the same amount of days and same amount of hours in a week but the checks never match. Get 5 checks and then leave don’t waste your time
bad,My opinion doesn't quite count as I was young working a part-time job.So I have to type up a 150 word review of this job so I'm typing this to get there!
bad,"Very long and unsociable hours. "
bad,"Pros:"
bad,"Pros"
bad,Poor Management - There is no life in this company as lay off is all over the place. As new people enter - it becomes hard to manage the landscape which is why lot of people are leaving
bad,a typical day for me was closing would have to stay 3 or 4 hours after closing they would tell people that had emergency that they cant leave until store is 100% clean  so if some one wasn't finished with a section couldn't leave.
bad,"Very political, difficult to progress.  Motivations of individuals are centred on themselves not the business or customers. "
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
bad,"This Biltmore Phoenix Ralph Lauren store will be one of the many anticipated Ralph Lauren locations closing soon. Customers are repelled by this location. Management has been bad for many years. Gorgeous store and such a shame, but turnover is high and management has failed for years. Customers, clients, and local retailers have given it the nickname "" the morgue"" because of the lackluster warm service and uncomfortable feeling they get while attempting to browse."
bad,"*too  much favoritism"
bad,It was a fun environment. I worked there part-time.  It was great while going to college. It was enjoyable with great people.
bad,Discombobulated and has a very high turn over. Floor support does mor offer help because they are always in a bad mood. The scheduled hours are ridiculous.
bad,Management are unfair and unreliable and untrustworthy it’s very bias as well as all the managers are friends outside of work too! Manager told customer to f**k off nothing was done about this and was basically covered up yet people where always pulled in for recorded convos for petty things! For the hours and the amount of stress/pressure your under it’s not worth the wage nor is it worth being treated like rubbish by management who seem to have a thing on looking down on you and speaking to you like your nothing!
bad,"The managers that I opened the store with were AMAZING. But when they started to leave one by one and new management came, the new ones ran the store into the ground. Lazy and chilled in the back office ALL day!"
bad,Not sure about Ralph Lauren as a whole but my experience was horrible. I was mistreated and disrespected. There was no concern to my well being. Would not recommend
bad,"Corporate is out of touch with reality of daily struggles, issues, and lack of adequate payroll effects theft, cleanliness and quality of the environment."
bad,"Typical day is filled with fire drills from Senior Leadership team"
bad,"Era habitual llegar y no saber tu horario de la semana siguiente, incluso del dia siguiente."
bad,"The manager of the store was inconsistent. Would never show up in time for work nor put the effort, yet when she did it was to berate us for missing target and sales. The management team is very pushy towards signing up people for emails and cashiers were put down if they couldn't reach ""sign up"" targets. The employee turnover, due to bad management and overall bad environment, was so high they hire new batches of employees every two weeks. If you need a quick job while you look around, apply here. Just be aware that will be treated as a tool and not as a person"
bad,"in IT - impossible to advance. zero growth. if someone leaves... no replacement - you are now stuck doing a job of 1 or 2 or more ppl..."
bad,"Terrible management. Terrible place to work, no emphasis on learning and development. No interest in using data. Decisions are made on emotion and gut feelings."
bad,I think a lot could change at Ralph Lauren they rude don’t know how to talk to people don’t wanna listen just all around rude Managers a coordinators should not be in positions and don’t know what Their doing the people are rude talk to like a child don’t wanna work with no Your percentage/Production A lot of work needs to be done there
bad,"Awful management, awful pay, awful everything. I would not work here again for all the tea in China. Underpaid, overworked and treated as a disposable cog in the RL machine."
bad,The company is nothing like what it once was. staff members have been getting layed off for years now. My position was part time. A position management wanted to get rid off. Management basically forced me to quit by micro managing me. I reported management to HR for harassment and HR didn’t attempt to assist me until weeks after I couldn’t take the harassment any further and walked off on the job. This company is a drowning ship!
bad,"Bare minimum number of full time employees supported by disgracefully low paid temps (who NEVER get hired full time).  Forget about advancement.  Management has adopted the ""if you don't like it here, there's the door""attitude regarding employee issues.  Their first and only priority - STOCK VALUE.  The Lauren family control 80% of the stock, so you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out where employees stand.  Rumor has it the new CEO is installing pay toilets next month in all the NC facilities."
bad,"At the time it was a very challenging place to work, store went thru 5 diff. store managers. Really hard to get your hard work and dedication recognized. Manager promoted employees based on favoritism not performance"
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
bad,"The store in Destin, FL was constantly out of payroll. The store was a complete mess every day . The completely unrealistic expectation were too much. I was there almost 2 years... Upper management spends more time in the office than running the business."
bad,"Staff meetings, scheduling, tailor salon supervision, introduced a smoother procedures for tailor records, inventory control, business reports, staff support"
bad,slave labor terrible pay they have you on production and dont pay you for it this is an awful place to work wouldnt recommend work here.no room for growth slave labor slave labor slave labor terrible management
bad,Pay rate to low for the amount of work required to do. A lot of heavy lifting . Standing for long periods of time with short breaks. Work load not consistent may be asked to leave early.
bad,"Assist very particular customers, regular stock pulls, overall atmosphere is poor and stale, hardest part of job is following backwards thinking management from top to bottom."
bad,"If I am being 100% honest the all around vibe and feeling you get from the management team is horrible. They have multiple times talked out of manner to individuals that work there and the only reason that they feel entitled to do so is because they are mostly minors. Most of there staff doesn’t last long in the job because of how terrible they are treated. The management team takes things personal in a work environment. For example, if they call you to come in on your day off or they ask you to come in early and you can’t they take that situation personally. They are often on edge due to the fact that people just leave the job. All that tension that builds up has to be released at one point. And it does, situations like are what ruin a work environment. They often misinterpret a situation and instead of fixing  the situation like the leadership role that they are given they much rather be petty and childish. Take in mind that they have been doing this for years and they have not learned from there mistakes. I’m not saying every single management leader from that location is terrible, but it only takes a few to ruin it for everyone. The scheduling is terrible as well. We  have certain times that we are scheduled to work but we never seem to get out on time. For example, if you are scheduled to clock out at 10:30 you usually get out 11:30-12:00. They don’t allow you to leave at the time you are scheduled to leave. I understand that sometimes the need to stay is necessary, but this happens every single day. When I started working I did not get any proper training I was not taught"
bad,"For me the work environment was very depressing! I dread going to work. The music was horrible so it made the work day feel longer, the store closed at 9pm but sometime wouldn't leave until 10, or when we're doing floor display it'll be somewhere around 1am. Just everything about this job I did not like."
bad,"rythme intense de travail"
bad,I wanted to work for this brand for so long. What a shame it all turned out to be. The store couldn't keep staff because management was awful. Far more concerned with playing childish games then actually running the store. Management gossips too much and sales associates are played against one another creating a terrible store atmosphere.
bad,"Staff were given a 90 probation plan once they had joined. Training was given, but if mistakes were made, then it would be put on their record. However, these mistakes would add up and later be used against you in your probation review"
bad,"Ralph Lauren is run by old cats who refuse to wake up and smell the coffee. The retail industry is changing quickly and RL cannot catch up. Confidence will have to eventually get placed with new upper management, middle level employees need to be treated better/trusted more."
bad,Fun environment but that's about it. Limited development opportunities and the hours can be long especially within retail as a whole. would recommend for entry level applicants.
bad,"Very unorganized company to work, no one doing a right job, no one knows what their doing!!!!!!! Every one just want to come to work to kill time.Store always look bad. Embarrassing to say that I work for Ralph Lauren."
bad,"Was daar een puinhoop van komen en gaan aan collega's . Begeleiding in het begin gaat bijna niet door drukte. Maar kunt eigenlijk alleen rekenen op de mensen die nog geen jaren daar zijn voor hulp want de andere hadden zoiets los het je maar op moesten wij ook toendertijd... iedereen klaagt over het management maar achter hun rug .te veel werkdruk van ""hoger af"""
bad,Extremely unorganized management.    Ralph Lauren would be appalled to see what goes on in the back room with his merchandise - filthy back room operations and overcrowded - violating fire laws.  Could barely walk in the back without getting hurt.  No water on 12 hr days of Black Friday.  Don’t let the brand fool you - overwhelming for management which resulted in poor relations and unrealistic expectations for employees
bad,"Overworked and then laid off."
bad,"Senior management is all about favorites , discrimination , rude behavior towards team members."
bad,A typical day at RL is fast paced.. Heavy calendar...Lots of meetings and fittings. It was a great way to learn how to work under pressure. I worked with the Collection team and they were all great!!!
bad,I would not recommend working for this company.  Although the product is good.......................................................................... If you dont wanna have cocktails after work. You will not progress I. This company.
bad,"If you are a person of color and female...consider other career opportunities. There is very limited chance to exceed.  The culture is toxic,  extreme favoritism."
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
bad,"Typical Day:"
bad,terrible management. Directors need to go to training on how to deal with human beings. Very negative atmosphere where employees were overworked and disgruntled .
bad,"I loved this job till everyone thinks they are better than you because they have been there longer. To much drama, attitudes. It's hard to get anywhere when you are the minority."
bad,"Ralph Lauren hires thru temp agencies and they feed you promises of getting full time and you never will. it is super rare. the job security is non-existent. management are like children, they run in cliques. keep in mind, this is the warehouse."
bad,I provided customer service and eventually became a floor salesmen.
bad,It was my first job. I was excited until I learned who and what I was working with. Ignorance is not professional.
bad,"Processos engessados, não investia em tecnologia, câmera espalhada pela empresa toda, vigilância com seguranças particulares."
bad,"Many people were not paid on time, or fairly. Different wages for the same position and a lot of breaching agreements on the part of the managers. Love the friends I made along the way though."
bad,"I worked at Polo when I was a sophomore/junior in high school, I had three female co-managers, they constantly fought, told us to do things and then another manager would direct us differently. They would use extremely racist remarks behind customers backs, and even towards their own employees. I'm of Asian descent and one of the managers offered for me to take inventory because ""Asian's are good at numbers right?""."
bad,"Not a fun evironment to work, management don t have a clue of what they are doing, one manager will tell you to do these while another one will tell you to do complete opposite."
bad,Serves they give to busses 20/0 per cent of they tips well is ok on our tips I like to work at Ralph Lauren but now business are slow we work only like tre days per week
bad,"Very boring with, very poor management, supervisors are disrespectful,  Doesn’t distribute equal working hours to employees. Short breaks"
bad,"The staff are treated very badly. "
bad,The staff was misleading. Had to bu8y expensive polo clothes to wear to work after clearly stating we didnt have to upon being hired. The managment was rude and always gave the cold shoulder. We couldnt tak to each other during inventory at night whenn the store was closed. Felt more like K5 than being an adult qorking a job at 3 AM. Over dramatic and overly rude and stuck up to be making such a minimum payout. This whole job was a joke.
bad,"The culture is very ""It's not what you know, it's who you know.""  If you are not part of the ""in"" crowd, you won't go anywhere.  I have not been allowed to apply for other positions within the company and I have been passed over for promotions without a clear explanation."
bad,District Manager level and upwards need to focus on retaining good people and good management. Its a revolving door and most people do not leave on good terms. Managers are very into cliques - typical retail environment. There are definetly better places to work that will pay similar and not have to deal with the heavy sales pressures and fake connections and opportunity for growth. The company is not in a good place financially and the stress trickles down quickly.
bad,"All I'll be saying is that management is not what it used to be. I have a blast working my shifts because of my co workers. I strive to do anything they need and be reliable but don't feel like I necessarily receive the recognition for doing so. Communication is poor with management at times, as well as a sense of urgency."
bad,"A typical day at work is stressful because of the management was always concerned about themselves. Being apart of the management was negative because the higher-ups had already been working together for so long. Some managers hold grudges, put all their work on you, and throw you into everything without a lot of training. You have to make the best of it and try to be apart of the cohort. The hardest part of the job was the stress with other managers causing the stress. The most enjoyable part was the sales associates in the workplace."
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
bad,Working at Ralph Lauren is giving out a lot of energy than you receive from the company through pay. The working conditions are pretty standard nonetheless but you would not last long in there.
bad,"Working at Polo gave me a lot of experience with retail, but I wouldn't go back. There are barely any full-time positions, but everyone is expected to be available for full-time hours. The managers were unfair when it came to scheduling because they would mainly schedule their favorite workers and not give much hours to others. If you requested a day-off weeks before they made the schedule, they would still schedule you for that day."
bad,At first I really enjoyed working for this company but the longer I was there the more it felt like I was in a high school environment. If you want to move up in the company you better kiss up a lot hard work doesn't get you far. The management hangs out with underage employees outside of work in club like environments I found that very inappropriate and can definitely make work miserable. Leaving this job was the best decision I ever made. If your a social high school or college student this job is perfect for you if you hate drama avoid this job. And the pay is horrible for the stress this job put me through. Defiantly not worth it
bad,"-Managers run a sales rally"
bad,"While working at polo, my first day there was on black Friday. It wasn't very fun for me. After that it got better but the management wasn't very helpful nor were they friendly."
bad,awful to work for- no work/life balance.  they lay off people with no advanced notice because of budget cuts.  they have unrealistic expectations and do not pay their employees enough for the hours they work
bad,For people who like to sale and interact with people.Learned alot about the retail industry. New management very by the book at their convenience. Some very helpful employees. Long standing so you must wear the proper attire and enjoyed helping customers select items.
bad,An amazing place to meet new and interesting people. A job where u meet all types of people. If you like to play dress up this job is perfect for you.
bad,"Completely disappointed with the training process.., sink or swim environment. "" Fail early is what they want""...………………………………………………………………………………………………."
bad,This part of the company has no advancement and everyone is aware. Most people leave after three years if they have any ambition at all. Company is in shambles probably won't be around in 15 years.
bad,"-Fast paced"
bad,This was not an enjoyable place to work. It consisted of very tedious work and long hours with no benefits. Management was always changing and inconsistent as well.
bad,"It's a great place for small supplemental income. The discount makes the job worth coming too. However the store is extremely unorganized. There is high turnover from management to lower level staff. The current general manager/hr person is horrible, she has little to no communication, she isn't friendly, thus being the reason for the high turnover. The previous general manager was the polar opposite. I really miss him."
bad,company dosent care about any job work /balance extremely long hours no appreaction. never get any holidays off and 11 hour workday everyday
bad,Terrible company with limited growth and pay.  Not treated equally with your coworkers and expected to work through lunches.  No room for growth.  I probably would have enjoyed it more in a better division
bad,"Helping customers, folding clothes, maintaining stockroom. was a typical day at Ralph Lauren. "
bad,The company is poorly run and the management is a shambles and would not advise working for them as only reason keeping me there is my great back of house colleagues
bad,"I began working at Ralph Lauren after they were desperately hiring. I was the first employee of many to come within a 2 month time span. At first everyone was welcoming, and I felt comfortable. However, they began to show their true colors. Management would constantly degrade you and gossip about you, on top of giving zero recognition. Many customers vouched for my assistance,yet I was never “enthusiastic” enough. The hours were very decent, but they did not respect your availability. They would even change your hours the day of without informing. The other associates were very kind, but management showed favoritism and were also sneaky. One of my managers even wrote a google review about me being unenthusiastic pretending to be a customer. I was far from quiet. Basically the job is decent if you become favorites with the bosses, and enjoy folding things for hours. They also did not train me since I started the day after my interview, but got mad when I did not know how to do something."
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
bad,"can get very busy on weekends, and very quiet in the week. management are generally poor, with a few exceptions, but they do not seem to care about the staff, only about the money. staff turnover at bicester village is ridiculously high because the managers would rather fire good staff for minor things, or cause people enough stress that they hand in their notice, than to care about how they treat their staff. "
bad,"I worked at Ralph Lauren children’s store over in Bicester village, we was on minimum wage and was the lowest paid store in the village. Was shocking because I’ve read about how much profit the company makes a year! It was my first retail job and it really made me consider making it my last! At the time all the managers was very young and immature, a lot of bullying between the colleagues and managers. I witnessed a lady walk out of the job and swore at the managers and then saw the managers circled by the back door soon after talking about her for the next hour. On my third day there I heard rumours about me which was untrue. WORST place ever. Was honestly like going back to school it was depressing."
bad,"Most of the employees there are friendly and easy to get along with. The customers are usually friendly, but there are many who are rude and will completely trash the store before the end of the day. Clean up after the store closes can take hours. Employee turn around is fast, even with the management. I don't think there is really any direction for the store because the clothes sell themselves. Currently, the store has completely gone down hill over the past few years. Hopefully management can discover and impliment new hiring policies and competitive wages to turn that around. If you're looking for a full time job here, they don't exist, unless you're a supervisor or manager. You could still work 40 hours per week, but you will be grossly overworked, underpaid, and not receive benefits. The only real reason to work at this store is because you love the brand and enjoy the employee discount. Otherwise, you can get better pay and experience somewhere else."
bad,"It was good for what it is. "
bad,Not a great job to have. Management is unorganized and we were underpaid considering the amount of labor expected. I wouldn't recommend anyone apply there.
bad,"RL is an American corporation where hierarchy and internal politics play a significant role. The brand itself has been able to survive solely relying on it highly reputable name. It is not a creative environment but a group of departments benefiting from an already established, but now suffering, system where once successful designs and projects are repeated."
bad,"Destin is a tourist town... March through August is when they have hours. Great Summer job, nice discount, update ur wardrobe for ur next job. Management quotes the rules daily, but follows them as it suits their mood. They will cut ur hours and use them for their own unnecessary overtime."
bad,This is a very uncomfortable question to ask someone seeking employment.  I have worked for Fortune 500 and 100 companies as well as owning a small retail business.
bad,"I hated working for Polo but not all because of the company. You can't work around your daily life unless you know its coming up a month in advance. For part timers, that isn't good."
bad,"flagship store but operation was rigid by wrong managerial style."
bad,"The ontario location is a horrible place to work, Management is awful will be nice to you one minuet and the give you the cold shoulder the next. They want you to be available 24/7. Pay is not worth the amount of work that is out on you. There's a reason why this location never keep long time workers. The only good thing about this place is the people you work with, spending every holiday and everyday you become close, they're the only reason why I lasted a few years."
bad,"Not a place to recommend to any of my friends, and family. Ralph lauren makes enough money to pay their employees better. You have to work their for at least 10-15 years to get at least $15 per hour."
bad,"not great hours of work, most of the staff cant be bothered to even be at work training new starters are mainly uni kids who don't care about the brand"
bad,it was not as good as people were making it to be and the pay was average for my age and the management was not that good at all. But the only thing that was good about that place was that it was close to home.
bad,managers were never on the same page at work . was really hard to get any time off. our GM gave us a hard time when calling in. but coworkers (outside of managers) were sweet and fun
bad,"All managers worked so hard every day-overtime, rare breaks, physical stocking.  Even though we exceeded sales goals regularly we rarely got recognized. The best part was our sales staff. The company changed ideas so frequently but the staff would always change as well. Worst part was our GM. Played favorites."
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
bad,The team that i worked with was always together so if you did not hang out with them you got the grunt work of the day. The management there played favorites so it was hard to move forward.
bad,"Les points + : "
bad,"I only lasted there a few months because I was being picked on by everyone including the managers, they would try their best to get me fired and I just ended up leaving on my own."
bad,"I used to work for PRL, back in the day. Then, it was a fantastic company. Now it it everything one could hate about modern retail."
bad,"Although the job can be bit boring, it's manageable and sometimes fun. Co-workers are great, and respectable."
bad,"job was ok .. customer type was very difficult, management was not available regularly . Hard to get a decent schedule ...bad policy's"
bad,I was only there for 2 months and it felt like 2 horrible years. The management was horrible. It was slavery. 
bad,Management is absent and ineffectual. No employees return phone calls or e-mails in a timely manner. Workplace culture is cold and clique-ish. No one seems to care about doing their job well or at all. A complete mess in corporate.
bad,"I was hired for my interior design skills and was not made aware of the slow paced and almost none existent foot traffic in the home collection department. I was not told that I will be cold calling, and email blasting for new clientele. The store manager is a nightmare and has spoken to me maybe 10 times over the past year I have been with the company, he sets very high goals that are almost impossible to reach and has never offered any amount of positive advise but seems to criticize and talk down to the employees when quotas are not met. This job pays by commission and is a very negative work environment when business is slow."
bad,managment could have been alot better.. but other then that i enjoyed working with a few of the employees.
bad,"They make you work like a donkey and pay you near to nothing one 1 employees benefit which is discounted clothes, there isn’t a family feeling and people are always reminded how disposable they are"
bad,Ralph Lauren taught me many new visual merchandising skills that I have applied many times in my new position. It taught me to focus on detail and that merchandising can make a difference if done well.
bad,"Very political and unrealistic hours."
bad,A typical day would be fixing everything. Taking care and checking out the people that came in. The management was very fun and made it go by a lot quicker.
bad,"I put in about 4 years and have learned a lot. Management was good except for the general manager, her dirty work is covered up by the other managers and in turn, she looks good to her boss. I love Ralph Lauren, but corporate needs to keep an eye out for their general managers. Many people before and after my career with Ralph Lauren have left because of our general managers poor skills. Just because you put a certain amount of years into a company, does not make you a great employee."
bad,Basically a nice group of people to work with. Shifts varied from morning hours to evening hours and was very militaristic when it came to the way they treated most of the employees.
bad,Working here you will never become full time. You can work there for years on end but never get offered a full time job. The full time employees treat you very different.
bad,Pay well below what is needed to rise above poverty. The management is up and down and picks favorites. There is minimal incentive to do well because the difference in pay between high and low performers is often less than A dollar.
bad,"Since this was for me a temporary job I was fine with it, but I would not want to work in retail. It was an ok job while is was there since I was restructuring my life and had to have a flexible schedule."
bad,I like the job just not enough pay the people are good workers to work with the mangers are well at helping you and others if you need anything help they will help you
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
bad,Management was over-worked and very stressful for store walk-thru events. Fun to work with other employees but everyone seemed fake. Long hours and hard work dealing with upscale customers wanting to be pampered.
bad,Good to work for if you have no life. This  job requires patience as you are dealing with a largely spoiled and entitled customer base.The reps are told basically give customers what they want to appease even when the customer is out of line.
bad,"An interesting position that tapped into my creative skills and education."
bad,New upper managment has made the company almost unbearable to work for. It is often micro managed by other general managers in the district not even by district or regional managers. No one can be trusted everyone is out to get each other
bad,good entry level job just like any other retail job. opportunity for advancement was clearly an issue as positions seem to go to those already preselected
bad,"Leadership was great at product but team leadership wasn't very strong."
bad,This is great oppertunity to learn information about the fashion industry. Always trending and very informatiove. This is a good place to work especially if you like to shop
bad,"The company hires hundreds of temporary employees and ignores the fact that the most hardworking individuals have already been there for 1 to 5 years without any offer of full time employment."
bad,"i worked day in a day out for this company, I never left when people jumped shipped. I only made 11.25 the whole time i was there. unfair Also, i feel like they only choose people that look like them to advance. (you do the math)"
bad,I've worked with Ralph Lauren twice. This past time I worked almost 4 years and left getting paid $9.92 an hr. I think everyone should start off get paying $10 an hr. Also up their raise rate. It's a billion dollar company and pay horribly.
bad,"make sales at work, make sure all the correct items are on display."
bad,"This is a very busy place to work, you have to make sure customers always come first and make sure they leave feeling like you've done the best you can."
bad,"I would only recommend working here if you are looking for a career in the fashion industry. Management expects working miracles in short time and no man hours. Very stressful, a real ""ritzy"" feel for work environment. Inventory/stock rooms overstocked and unorganized."
bad,"A stock and sale associate is a common position in the retail industry that combines several responsibilities necessary for the day to day operations of a store. in your retail business, you will likely require your stock and sales associate to perform functions related to clerking,stock and inventory customer relations and even cleaning."
bad,"I was a sales a associate during the holiday seasons at one of their busiest locations. My duties included stocking the shelf's and and assisting customers. I also had daily sales quotas to meet which I was able to meet each time I worked. Theft prevention was a major part of our job and something I did not have to come across. I enjoyed helping customers, but at times would feel unappreciated because I was not given the starting pay I was promised, and felt under appreciated my upper management. My coworkers were very diligent hard workers as we all had to keep the store running neat and efficient during the intense rush of the black friday and past into Christmas season. I personally felt that with my past retail experience, college degree, and management experience I could have utilized in a more effective way to help the company, but once I saw there would be no room for promotion for me I put in my two weeks notice."
bad,It was a waste of time money gas and energy I could have done temporary work
bad,"A typical day is always customer service driven. Greeting and servicing customers, making sure that they have a good experience. I learned that it is important that your customers feel special and appreciated. That is always good for business. Management could definately be improved. Not all mangers understand how to bring out the best in their employees. Lack of respect doesn't help. My co-workers are great, could not have asked for better.The hardest part of the job is the stress that it has on the body. Sometimes physical work is necessary when staff is limited. The most enjoyable part of the job is my amazing co-workers, and also my customers. Its a good day when I am able to make big dollar sales."
bad,"I was a manager for this company for two years and took a lesser paying job to get the hell out of there. The management team is awful and they have no sense of direction or priorities. The blind leading the blind so to speak. When you have an entire seasoned management team leave the store in 12 months; you must look higher then the store manager for reasons. This company sounds great from the outside, but within they have some shady and at times questionable business practices."
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
bad,You are poorly paid and the company is poorly managed. Management is always stressed as they are always under pressure to produce and are always in a bad mood
bad,Decent learning if your'e looking to get in the sales field. No commission so the hard driving up sale culture does not really work. Hard to get employees to constantly up sale with no return.
bad,"Fairly Easy job, but incompetent coworkers make it much harder than it should be. Daily tasks were folding, cleaning the work floor. Cleaning back of house, and customer service."
bad,"Lots of talent and creative people, not so much room to grow creatively as things are boxed off here, it also depends which team you're on. Some teams don't care about advancement, promotions are very difficult to come by,"
bad,"Working environment should be collective fun and productive, not stressful. Equal opportunity for all. No partiality or unfair treatment should not be allowed."
bad,Great if you’re new to retail just the getting there is a hassle gets very busy but then very dead hours get cut you never have a set availability managers always get on your case over the smallest things
bad,Stressful environment to work in due to decline in sales. Management challenged to turn business around causing lots of uncertainty and lack of process.
bad,I enjoyed my work and the people were wonderful there. Good discounts. Good employee benefits. The territory I had was too small and did not generate enough sales to have a FT person in the territory. It was during the 2008 crash and sales dipped.
bad,"This job was depressing. I think everyone is just doing their jobs, but there is an underlying fear of the dying retail industry and the ailing RL brand. This manifests itself with vicious managers and belligerent coworkers all looking to place the blame on each other. Behind-the-scene politics dominated decision making and nobody trusted each other. "
bad,"Was dismissed after over 25 years loyal service. RL closed R&D facility where I was employed."
bad,RL has been running the same way for far to many years. they company is opposed to changing its ways which has effected them in growing with the time.
bad,Long hours and break policies and time keep changing. We receive our schedules very late. Manager is does not work well with employers and is not understanding.
bad,"Ralph Lauren wasn't an overall good experience. The management was non communicative. The customers were nice, but getting product was difficult."
bad,No team building approach. Management unable to deal with the human capital and talent of staff
bad,A typical work day consisted of providing customer service and maintaining sales floor. I learned always lead by example.
bad,Environment is very stressful for most. Managers are not competent.
bad,Worst part about this job it wasn’t never a schedule you’ll have to call a hotline to find out the day of if you had to work or not and coworkers picking with me
bad,"Started at 10.50 per hour, they dropped the pay to 8.50 per hour. Typical day at ralph lauren, would be unsettling hours. Different hours every day. On most days we'd be lucky to get 5 hours a day."
bad,The location I worked at hired unreliable employees where you were expected to pick up the extra slack. It was a very unorganized store where theft and speaking to the police was a common experience.
bad,"The hired hundreds of people for the call center. Great training for the role, but was treated more like cattle.  But in their defense, its hard to keep tabs on so many new people."
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
bad,"working at Ralph lauren was good."
bad,"CAUTION: This company is going under. Online sales are not meeting expectations and stores are closing left and right."
bad,"The management at Ralph Lauren was disappointing, they don't offer good enough hands on training at the start to feel comfortable with your job role, i felt there was no chance of progression as they always hire outside of the company for higher job roles and don't offer enough training in these job roles to employees inside the company. However the staff were very friendly and i was able to learn through the more experienced employees."
bad,It was a stressful work environment.   Decisions were constantly changed and we had to rework the line throughout the creative process.   Meetings were held late in the evening no work /life balance.
bad,"Extremely long hours, shift work. Minimal training, unrealistic expectations, disconnect between General Manager and District Manager. Hostile work environment."
bad,RL used to be a great place to work.. It has been going downhill in the last 3 years. It used to be a company that cared about the employees That has changed and they only care about the bottom line.
bad,"Loved working with my co-workers, they are always willing to help out when needed, never had management looking over your shoulders"
bad,nothing more nothing less. not much room in the way of advancement. they change your schedule all the time last minute. tons of craziness
bad,"A typical day at Polo is selling merchandise, working stock, or ringing up customers. Management is the worst part about Polo Ralph Lauren, they expect so much from employees with no praise or even a thank you in most cases. The best thing is pay, for a part-time retail position you'll make more than minimum wage and there are yearly raise evaluations."
bad,A typical day at work consists of standing on my feet all day an dealing with CHEAP foreigners who think that they're better than everyone else. My co-workers are pretty amazing people. I wish I could say the same about management. It seems as if they don't know what they are doing when it comes to finances and running the store in general. The hardest part of the job is having to be in such a miserable environment. The most enjoyable part of this job is when my shift has ended and I am leaving for the day.
bad,"Customers are rude, management is nice but the GM is not nice at all."
bad,"Don't like customers after working here."
bad,"I learned a lot about computers I did returns, inventory.I did receiving"
bad,"The compensation is competitive, especially with the bonus potential available to managers. There is room for growth if you do well and have a good store team supporting your development. "
bad,The Polo Factory Store in Pleasant Prairie is an OK place to work if you're young or still in school. They offer flexible hours. As a long term job I do not feel like it is that great.
bad,"It was a cool experience for a young person such as myself ,other young people will like it it’s kind of fast paced but you’ll get the hang of it . It’s a nice fresh out of high school job really."
bad,I love the employees there and meeting new ones however the management team is very combative and will at all times say things that bring out the worse in you and make you not want to work there especially since the work is so easy
bad,"i worked at ralph lauren polo factory outlet in saw grass mills mall a typical day was early in the morning started work at 5 am and got off at 10 am we did inventory daily count all clothing and accessories manually and with a scanner then we replinesh the floor with addig missing spaces of clothing and accessories etc. i leanred how to work with diffrent race personality each day and we shared lunch, breakfast and communication was friendly with my polo staff. work place culture was team work ariented everyday. the hardest part of my job was the trvaeling early in the morning driving at 5am was not easy.and also faced pace environment was also hard, most enjoyable part of the job was  meeting new people and getting the huge discount at ralph lauren polo"
bad,"Très belle marque, mais les boutiques et corners en belgique sont mal gérés, désordre , vols interne.. beaucoup de commérages."
bad,Poor treatment of supervisory staff. My first few months experience with this company were excellent.  However with the change of management came inequality and harassing treatment.
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
bad,"Essendo un negozio piuttosto grande e facendo parte di un'azienda di notevoli dimensioni e molto strutturata, ci sono molte mansioni diverse da svolgere nell'arco della giornata, dunque non è un lavoro per niente noioso."
bad,"* Provide legendary customer service to each customer regarding placing orders"
bad,"Enjoyed immediate peers, Typical day checking email/company website,Am and Pm. Lead sales floor, hardest part of job lack of direction and communication. Learned about company."
bad,"Trop de  pression aux employeur , mouvais manageur , mauvais salaire"
bad,"- In the middle of kuala lumpur city"
bad,"I was disappointed by my experience working at Ralph Lauren. My co-workers were helpful and the environment was good, but the management was extremely poor. Management would engage in petty arguments with employees and act immature. There was an absence of positive culture at the store, and it was more focused on how dedicated an individual was to the company instead of the quality of work they produced. Management hired too many workers while I was hired there and I did not get the hours I was promised in my interview. Overall, I would not recommend that anyone work at this Ralph Lauren location."
bad,"Ralph Lauren was very organized training was superb , just the hours were too short and work ran out extremely fast , but it also was a temp job. The Pay was fair so to say."
bad,RL was such a great company but it continues to diminish. Consent change in leadership above  for better or worst do not work as a temp they do not have the budget to hire right now.
bad,"The only good thing about it were my coworkers. Pay sucked, little to no raises, expect alot of work from you with little in return, no promotions, crazy overnight hours (with no extra pay). All-in-all if you have this as a short time job it is not bad but as anything more id take a different route."
bad,Great brand but the company is going through changes that affect people at the lowest level.  Everyone looks like a Walmart employee.  Too many coupons out there for people to find
bad,"I just moved to the area and needed a job and they were the first one to call me with an interview. so i to the job. it stared off ok bu i could tell that is was something going on in the store. it had its good and fun days working there but for the most part, very unprofessional and it starts with management"
bad,"Being a student, school comes first but the circumstances I was put in due to family issues I had to get a job. In the beginning Ralph Lauren assured me they would be flexible with my school schedule, in the end it turned out to be the exact opposite. Knowing my school is 30 minutes away from my work place they would repeatedly schedule me 10-15 minutes after I would let out of school. My breaks were always short... I was not allowed to leave the break room on my break and it was just not right. The employees were welcoming but however the management was not."
bad,"RAlph lauren strung me along. promising me work advancement but they never followed through on their end. even with me giving my all to the job. They only had one full time employee, besides managers.."
bad,Great place to start a career from the ground up. Unfortunately the brand's namesake doesn't carry the same weight to consumers it used to. Ultimately the brand attempts to hold on to what it used to be instead of investing to remain relevant. Lots of corporate upheaval and talent loss due to extensive layoffs (right-sizing due to rampant hiring within the last decade).
bad,"A typical day at work would consist of me making sure the boxes were accounted for, unloading loading the boxes to be ready for the store . What I learned was to be fast , consistent , to be ready at all times , management was good learned a lot from them, I was good at direction to what they wanted I completed , workplace culture was really fast pace but really got used to the work so I gradually excelled at my job , hardest part of the job was to know you are always on a time based so you had to be fast , the most enjoyable part of the job was learning everything about the job to set an expectation to learn and to be able to know I could accomplish what I was given to do ."
bad,"Ticket cloth items properly and process orders. Full-time employees only can get discount on items.I learned how to pack boxes and how assembly line works,"
bad,It's easy to get lost in the fray due to the size of the company. There isn't clear direction and the day-to-day is filled with scrambling to meet deliverables.
bad,Overall my experience was good with all my co-workers although management really sucked. They did not know how to cope with the workers nonetheless handle situations and really took their positions to the head.
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
bad,"To be honest I never got the real life work experience at the Polo Store, its like they used the younger crowd to help move the clothing in & get the store ready for the grand opening and then like after they stop scheduling the younger people to work in the store and get the experience."
bad,"Bonne expérience, bon management ! Salaire à revoir notamment en outlet car beaucoup plus de travail que dans les magasin parisiens."
bad,Worked in children department and running fitting room. Being around people from all over the world. This polo is located in the mall so I seen a lot of people throughout my shift on the days i worked.
bad,I wrote this review already Indeed. Not writing it again. I told you about how the company is actually good if you work for them directly but never through a retail outlet.
bad,"They were very strict about doing your job. The managers were always on top of you. Meanwhile they were standing around doing nothing. I couldnt stand being there, I had to leave."
bad,It was an okay place to work. The pay was nice and I was able to get plenty of hours. Some of the people that work there are very nice. It was not a hard job but it definitely kept me on my toes. If you like retail it’s an okay place to work. It definitely wasn’t a super fun or great place to work but it was a decent job. They will schedule you almost all or all of your available hours so be direct about when and how long you want to work.
bad,"You can work without any problems, under the management but, the coworkers, disagree with everything. Honestly i do not recommend work there. FOR PREVENT ANY FUTHER PROBLEM"
bad,Management was extremely disorganized and very rude. They spoke to associates in a very dehumanizing manner and did not care about the wellbeing of the employees.
bad,"For me it was all about the teams I worked with! It made the job great. I'm now looking for something in the Interior Design world or Visual Merchandising arena (Apparel, Accessories and or Home)"
bad,Great place to work and you also get a discount on clothes. There are flexible about your schedule.
bad,"I work at the polo store in Las Vegas when I first got the job I was ecstatic. But quickly after they started cutting everyone's hours. I went from work 5-7 days out of the week with flex-shift(overtime) to maybe 3 or 4. Sometimes even 2. We were told that we had to share our hours with other Polo stores. Which I didn't understand. The thing that really bothers me though, is that we get paid bi-weekly. Which isn't necessarily A Bad Thing. But if you get paid bi-weekly and you only work 3 days out of a week and the other week you have off you're basically only getting paid for one week. Round that up with the 4 weeks that's in a month you're actually only getting paid for 2 weeks. It's just not enough to make ends meet"
good,Not enough doers and too many initiatives for anyone to keep up with w/o proper staffing.  Too many leaders w/ inconsistent messages.  Not recommended if you want a work life balance.
good,"During my employment at Ralph Lauren my work life balance suffered. Management and associates were expected to work nine hour shifts back to back with less than eight hours in between. "
good,Ralph Lauren looks to demotivate employees by overworking.  It seems like they only cared about the bottom line.  Employees are worked like animals with little acknowledgement.
good,Once the store moved from its previous location to the current one the management became cruel with lack of respect for it's associates.
good,A fast paste atomshphere with alot of challenges that will prepare you for management levels.
good,They don’t pay fairly and they overlook a lot of their best workers. They also try to over work you. They don’t give you enough hours even as part time. They show a lot of favoritism. None of the rules from the beginning are followed.
good,"When I started working here I had a lot for the brand and the store supervisors. My associates are  friendly and respectful. But most of them lack work ethics, this job is an easy job but everyone here does their own thing. Every supervisor comes up with their own policy, especially the ones responsible for the cash register. Recently they hired new people, and they are lazy and unprofessional. The reason for thier hiring was that every supervisor got 350$ worth of polo bucks."
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,Only seemingly good thing about Polo is the discount. You do not get much benefits working here. Hours are picky you never really know what you’ll get. We have no security etc...
good,Management doesn't care about the associates. All they care about is themselves and their advancement. Recently had half the staff quit b/c of new management. They need to be more respectful of people.
good,Picked orders and shipped them out.  Did some packaging of products as well.  Learned alot about shipping and bills of lading.  Entered shipping info into the computer.
good,annoying and rude managers and co workers. they are very judgemental and extremely gossipy. They are all caddy people who work here.
good,"No day was typical, at one time I would be handling 5-8 projects from start to finish.  Coordinating with vendors, budget management, Presentation preparation, and purchasing decorative items for installation.  Preparing for installations that mostly involved Global travel included vendor and facility coordination customs details along with logistic team management."
good,"The management was subpar, having lack of scheduling knowledge or concern for others. It wasn't hard work, just stressful due to managerial incompetence."
good,Some days are busy and some are slow but you'll always have something to work on. Organization for fast customer accessibility is key and great customer service.
good,"You need a thick skin and you need to be sure of yourself. There is a clique mentality and if you play the part you can do well."
good,Good brand terrible management and culture.Massive turnover of people they don't care about individuals but only numbers budget and stock price. I would not recommend working there
good,"The process is inefficient and time consuming, having to chase other teams for information, everyone is overwhelmed and over worked, it's like you do all this work for it to end up being you did only a fraction of it. Very discouraged do not feel empowered by management. Too many moving parts to complete one thing. Not happy there at all!"
good,Management is unorganized and lacks a good level of communication with the employees. The hours vary greatly some weeks you can get 30-40 hours and others they give you 4 hours.
good,"Fast Paced"
good,"You never get time to yourself, it is always working on your feet for however long your shift is. Management is not the greatest because they expect you to do their job but you don't get any benefits from it, but some of them are willing to work with you if you have a situation. Must have open availability or they wont give you any hours. Don't change your availability because they hate that and will cut your hours. Hardest part of the job is customers and the customer is always right mentality, being on your feet for 6+ hours straight, management stands around or hides in the office while associates do all the work. Pay is good for the industry but it is not good for the amount of work required. You have to work certain days of the week/month. once a month you get a secret shopper who has a body camera on them and they rate the customer experience. if you are on the video and you do bad you will get a write up. you are required to get 80% or more of the customers emails at the cash register...if not its a write up."
good,Learned a lot of things while I was there. The management wasn't all the best it could've been but it held the factory together. Worked you to death and the pay was unreasonable.
good,"Challenging and frustrating at times..some of the ""leaders"" of the line were rude at times..coming over snatching up your work ""showing"" you how to fold items! Seems like more leaders than workers..just saying!!"
good,"This position isn't for career purposes.  It was a position I took while transitioning from Florida back to NY until I found my groove.  I was mistreated, harassed, and embarrassed by management on a weekly basis.  I called their HR dept. and they did nothing to assist me.  I put up for 6 months until I found my position at Crown Point Equity."
good,"They offer great discounts on merchandise, full price as well as sale. Also benefits as far as, 401k and health insurance are offered as well. However if you don't make enough you can not afford to have them. Furthermore management isn't the greatest either. They don't really work and they only focus on gossip and what new article of clothing they can get for their personal rigging. Overall moral is extremely low and just about everyone is unhappy in the store/company. You can't even get the uniform that you are suppose to be provided with. And last, it is nearly impossible to advance within the company once you are in (depending on who you are)."
good,The work was good and challenging from my experience! Only big concerns is when it comes to management and the unprofessionalism. The employees complained a lot about management!
good,Management of store not consistent. Not a very pleasant place to work. Inconsistent rules and regulations. Inconsistent work hours. Training and communication with employees terrible.
good,Hard to advance in career. Management has poor organizational skills. Workplace culture was positive at first but quickly turned negative. Long hours with little pay.
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,"Learned a lot of my own strengths and weaknesses, however this workplace is not great in terms of motivation and promoting. A lot of higher ups who have been in the company for years with no fresh ideas."
good,"i had to help out every customer in the building, charge them as well on their way out and making sure they found everything they were looking for."
good,No job stability there unless you are full-time Ralph Lauren associate. Temps get treated like the bottom of the barrel. Working there you go from working 7 days a week 10 hr shifts to not working for two weeks straight. Co-workers were very nice. Managment sucks.
good,"Polo was a great job when I first started there. The management was fair with every employee and helped me learn a lot of new ways to help out customers in the beginning. By the end, new management came in and they had no control over the store."
good,As much as I loved working here the management being so strict makes it hard to enjoy working when not allowed to communicate with your colleges without being told off
good,Its a great place to work if you are looking to do your career like retail sale. Everyday you could learn about costumer service and about the brand fit.
good,"The 1st year of employment was nice, benefits are amazing and team members are really kind. total i've worked there for over 5 years. After year 2 I spent 2 1/2 years applying with in and asking to transfer to different departments, but i was denied or ignored. I even participated in the ""navigating your career program"" completed it and was still ignored, then finally I was unexpectedly laid off."
good,knowing the selling item for the week and trying to sell it at the highest price. on slow days the entire look of the store would change just to see if things would sell faster in a different space.
good,"My direct ""managers"" weren't open to helping me grow- only criticized me for things I didn't know how to do ( I was a college intern). I became friends with the President though and she helped me out a lot."
good,Stressful environment with a lot of micromanagement. Benefits are great. Office is crowded and dirty. Only a good place to work if you come in as a VP position or above.
good,"Not a good work life balance."
good,The company was great from management to my co-workers to everybody that was involved in the company............ We would get free lunch 2 out of the 5 working days and occasional overtime dinner meals.
good,"I have been working as Assistant Designer at Ralph Lauren Women's Collection for almost two years. Heavy workload and stressful working environment. Definitely learned a ton as a fresh graduate from design school but most of what I have been doing was office errands and basic tasks. Love my coworkers and feel like a family in the company, however, the corporate culture is not for me. Definitely needs patience for career growth in this company because it is hard for young designers to explore creativity in this big company."
good,"okay company temps thru distinctive personnel have no benefits,low pay and are the first to be sent home, when work slows down."
good,"SHow up for work, get bounced around because managers don't know where to zone you, get late lunch breaks, bad scheduling hours."
good,"What can I say, Ralph Lauren took me and gave me a great opportunity. I thank them for everything they've done for me. I learned so much in the 1 year and 3 months I worked for them. Let's be honesty no job is perfect there's always going be ups and downs but for the most part they were good to me. I recommend anyone who wants to start out in luxury retail to start here. My location in Houston Galleria wasn't the best but there are defiantly growing. I guess the best way to put it is all good things take time. If you want to get in somewhere and expect to just climb the latter then this isn't the right place for you. But if you want to put in the work and invest in yourself then it's a great place to start. I personally sold 750k within a years time but everyone is different. I worked hard for what I wanted."
good,"They have strict guidelines on proper customer service. It includes a lot of maintaining, folding, and moving quickly."
good,it was nice to work at polo got experiencxe made sales interacted with customers did stock  inventory associated with my sales assistant job has to move on to get a better job
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,"A good secure job that is easy once you get the hang of it and is good for gaining retail experience. However the management is unapproachable and condescending (bar a few members who are lovely) and good luck getting time off if you ever need to, no matter how much notice you give! I found that it was nearly impossible to ever get time off of work and so a part time job started to take over my whole life.whilst many of  my colleagues were great it was a very stressful and detrimental environment to my mental health, avoid if you are able."
good,"Decent job. Best for adults fresh out of school. A good place to start. Not really an opportunity to advance, no matter the experience you may have acquired."
good,The environment is completely chaotic and stressful. Everyone is always whispering and saying negative things behind closed doors. Layoffs are a common occurrence and come without warning.
good,"Rules and processes varied depending on location. Store management out of touch with corporate and associate input. It was hard making known what clients needed when opinions weren’t valued. Often somewhat of a boys club, and lots of people with pointless positions, and no actual input"
good,"Management, comes from getting hired within, however; not all that are vying for management position are typically notified by the higher ups. benefits are minimal, there is no pay raise, only goal matching, and realistic goals are met. Only some of the goals are unrealistic. Job culture is a selective one. not many people here like each other. mostly work is conducted and we leave for the night when the shift is over. there is no morale in the store due to the lack of team spirit or boosting of individualism."
good,"A truly great opportunity to be apart of the Ralph Lauren corporation, to see the ins and out of what it takes to run a company of this much volume .."
good,Extremely long hours. It has high turnover. Not investing in employees. My boss was a freelancer which didnt makes sense. She was only interested in sitting late to increase her hours and charge the company.
good,"they honestly pay you low and work you alot, but no overtime. you have to work late and come early in morning, sometimes even when they had audits they still want you to help and stay late during Christmas time"
good,"Not worth applying nor working for unless you can shrug off being yelled at and pushed around, as well as being given tasks that must be completed in an unrealistic time frame. It's too stressful of a job for the minimal pay that you receive."
good,It was nice at first but the there is no team playing which makes work really stressful; a change in management also made work a lot more crazy. They wanted people to work 150% with zero extra compensation.
good,Mostly great people. Rules vary depending on your department and who you report into. Great initiatives but hard to bypass bureaucracy.  All in all it is very relative to your department. Do not expect a 9 to 5 job.
good,The particular store that I worked for never gave any opportunity for advancement unless you were a part of the clique. there were certain employees that were given the chances even when they didn't have the experience.
good,"There was always a changing of employees and management team members at my location. The people that I worked with was awesome and they felt like a family. However, with over 20 managers and supervisors coming and going during my time got the employees to lose respect towards them. Sometimes it felt like sales associates were managing the store better. Moreover, once a manager gets to know you, they would take advantage of your work and get you to do long hours and overnights. Also, in my location, people who worked for 1 year/2+ years were getting paid less then the newcomers. Would go back for my co workers but hate the management team."
good,"Typical Day"
good,"The managers do not work together "
good,"You will learn a lot working for this company. People are pleasant and will help you, however, very long hours with no compensation. Very little room to advance."
good,It's an ok place to work some of the staff are really nice and I like working with them on a daily bases but it's time for a change
good,Excellent company covering various aspects of design and product development;  augmented with quality assurance approach to brand products
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,"Had a great history with Ralph Lauren working in the Mens & Womens Sweaters dept.  I had a wonderful supervisors who gave great support to his employees."
good,"Pros"
good,"I provide accounting support; my focus is pretty narrow but I have learned a few things about the retail business.  I like the people I work with but the computer systems are slow and make the job difficult. As a result, we put in a lot of unproductive hours to complete our tasks."
good,I worked at PRL for many year. Exciting work environment and a lot of opportunities for volunteering.
good,- Folding apparel and customer service.
good,Ralph Lauren tried their best for employees to feel comfortable and worth the job that they do. They as a company are very helpful but as a team management they failed multiple times. They try to imply rules on new comers which most of the time the higher positioned employees tend to break at multiple occasions.
good,"early mornings be prepared to work major holidays, fun you work with all different ethics. learn something new everyday hard woorkers, team players humble"
good,"This was a temporary position and the day consisted of sorting through clothes, organizing them by category and style, and dressing mannequins. Pictures were then taken of the mannequins for store concept."
good,"A typical day at work with Polo Ralph Lauren would consists of me clocking in, going out to the sales floor and maintaining my station of the store to make it look presentable."
good,"Buen sueldo sí, pero con horarios terribles, ambiente negativo si se te ocurre poner una pega sobre algo, managers de tienda ultra famosa y bordes que te ponen buena cara y luego te largan. Siempre hay ofertas de trabajo de Ralph Lauren, por qué será? Ni Dios aguanta. "
good,Theres a lot of things that are said and yet not given like bonuses. The management isnt very orginized and professional. But its not that bad of a place to work when your young and have time.
good,Good place to start in fashion business and then move on.  It is hard to advance yr career in this company. Stressful and intense work atmosphere.  Steep learning curve.
good,Ralph Lauren is a large global company with many opportunities within the organization.  Its a dynamic environment with plenty to do and will keep you busy and learning.
good,"There have been a lot of lay offs at RL. Right now employees are very concerned in all departments. Hopefully things will turn around with new CEO. "
good,"Great Environment to work, very people oriented. Management allowed time when needed to take care of any personal or family issues needed. Great atmosphere"
good,"Pros"
good,"There is pressure on the stylists even when there is no much clients, which we were encouraged to harass with our help. No client likes to be followed around or constantly watched. Stylists are paid almost minimum wage for selling over 5000$ during an 8 hours shift. No commissions. The employee benefits consist of a 50% off the merchandise which is only a benefit if you are used to shop in their stores."
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,I worked with the window display team at Ralph Lauren which meant you worked from when the store closed until the wee early morning hours. If it wasn't for the great people I worked with (close friends) then this job would likely have been miserable! But we had a blast. We were also paid well.
good,"Three stars because of how ugly things turned out with all the changes that occured. Management team was awesome in the beginning, then the management team started falling apart. Good managers were quitting and the company started hiring people who were less experienced. New policies were being applied. Scheduling was very flexible as far as working a full 40hr. even if you weren't a full-time associate. New policies made flexible scheduling impossible (e.g. If availability isn't open completely,  associates will get little to no hours)."
good,"Although it can be difficult to maintain a healthy work/life balance, RL is a very good place to work. There are opportunities for advancement for those willing to work hard. The compensation and benefits are excellent."
good,"Since I only worked there seasonal I didn't get many hours and I was still in high school. I liked working there, it just wasn't for long. They only had one horrible manger and everyone else was easy to work with."
good,"Ralph Lauren Co. is willing to give you a chance without any previous job experience. It's temp to hire, but it's very hard to become permanent. Temporary contracts are typically 3+ months during peak season, where you will then be considered as a permanent employee. I've been working as a temp for a year and a half and have acquired more skills than some of the permanent employees yet I don't get any benefits and my salary is still the same. No sick days or paid holidays as a temp and you are required to work Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve and New Years Eve,"
good,"Ralph Lauren gives you well rounded experience that you can take with you in all walks of life. Sales, cash handling, customer service, auditing, branch presentation and conflict resolution."
good,Home office employees do not have accountability for actions. Directly effects field workers who must stay to fix issues.  No work life balance because of this.
good,"A day at Polo right now is pretty simple. We show up, scan our badges about 10 times, have a daily meeting, and start working. We work two to four hours at a time consistently doing the same monotonous task and then take two fairly short breaks and then we're back at it until the end."
good,"Working here is outrageous! The environment and work space is great, but the Management suck! The volume constantly changes along with hours. Becoming permenant is really hard, I am aware of people who have been working there for 3 yrs and are still considered as temp"
good,The company itself is very competitive within itself. There is always a quote that must be met. There is always something new in the shelves. The new designer style and new clothing depending on the season and what is in style at the moment. The employees always had to wear the designer clothing but there pay is not good at all.
good,RL is a great place to start but I believe after your first few years you have to step out and do something else. The culture is very drab and heritage.
good,"Enjoyed my co-workers. "
good,Helping to run a fairly new program for customers that you have a hand in from beginning to end is very rewarding and something i like doing. It gives you a since of accomplishment when you can see the end result.
good,you dont get paid enough for all the work that is done and its not stable. you can get laid off in a week but can go back in a couple days.
good,At the time I worked for PRL I was in High School.  The management team there had poor communication and often seemed to pick favorites.  The compensation was poor and there were few hours to go around.  This is the place where I learned the basics of customer service and time management.
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,"It's a great place to learn but not typically to grow. Fast-paced environment. Hours are 9-6, 1 our lunch. A lot of company turn-over and change. No job security."
good,Its always busy because it's in a popular part of town. Always something to do and its never a dull moment there. The hardest part about the job is dealing with the customers and the crowd that comes to shop.
good,"difficile de se sentir important dans l'entreprise, mais le personnel est sympa"
good,Better communication between employees and staff that way it would be a better working environment and much more better experience for employees. Everybody's needs to work together
good,"A typical day as an sales associate included stocking the store and assisting customer's with their shopping needs.  "
good,"The brand is lovely, but the leaders did not perform. Communication is an issue.  No opportunity for growth.  Managers were not qualified for the job they were hired to do."
good,Ralph Lauren is full of motivated highly skilled individuals working towards a common goal.  Team continuously rallies to ensure a highly available and efficient compute environment.
good,"The company is definitely changing to be better. The schedule for the managers is not so good, due to the bad scheduling from the GM. DM doesn't visit the westoast often."
good,a good work culture to meet people from all walks of life. very educational from the fashion/retail aspect.not enough quality of life scheduling.
good,This place is great if you want to learn communication skills and how to help costumer in a very professional way. this store make their employees to give extra care to the costumers.
good,"loved job in the beginning. management has since changed. Honesty is not what is used to be.  They are still kind of good with job flexibility. Early management was great with training. if anything good skills learned from them,"
good,"Awesome if you aren't a sales driven person. Hourly wage, no commission, very easy going approach to selling. No personal quotas, calm music, great atmosphere. I worked at the highest volume store in Florida, so it was a MESS. Late shifts were usually until 2 am, sometimes until 4 am."
good,"I wont complain, it puts some money in my pockets. However Its not exciting, there's not much camaraderie. Managers push us stock team to the limits and when we do get the job done, there's very very little recognition. The say the store cant run without us, then turn around and cut our hours sometimes. Hours are unstable, you don't know for sure what days you'll be working the next week so don't make any plans with the family. Our hourly wage is good, but we don't work the hours to see a decent paycheck. The most enjoyable part is when they sometimes schedule me on Saturdays and I get to interact with customers."
good,I enjoyed working there and the atmosphere was most positive. It was a great part time job with flexible hours for college students.
good,"customer service is a big key , with the proper training there is a lot of product knowledge and standards to be learned . management team really isnt flexible, very over bearing, micro managing, office workers. the co workers are great for the most part very out going and nice people honest and loyal. hardest part of the job was the managers being very lazy. customer service would have to be the best part of the job"
good,"learned to keep a high standard of customer service at all times, and good time management."
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,Assisted and guided customers in choosing merchandise relevant to their needs. Promoted Polo Ralph Lauren products by upholding the reputation of the company and maintaining professionalism and integrity.  Maintained the cleanliness of the store and the merchandise on a daily basis in accordance with Polo Ralph Lauren’s visual merchandising policies.
good,"Polo was a clothing store for men & women. My job was to assist women in any help they needed with shoes, clothes, purses etc. I also was a cashier."
good,"Working at Ralph Lauren showed me how much a manager could not care. Some managers are nice people, but other will try to make you work more hours than already scheduled. Some will yell at you for making a simple mistake. It is constantly disorganized. However the employees make the job fun, but the managers don't want you to talk to them that often or you will find yourself in trouble."
good,"I would not recommend working at Ralph Lauren. Though I was only there for 8 hours per week, it became an unpleasant place to work due to poor flexibility of shifts and hours and an over-bearing management team"
good,"Not much to say about the company other than the hours would change every morning we started. One day it’s 6:00 in the morning, next morning it’s 5:00"
good,"Ralph Lauren being the prominent American fashion house, I was beyond excited to work for a brand. The management nourished it talent to succeed with direction and tons of training."
good,I love the brand however District and we management could have been better. Sometimes goals were unrealistic which could be perceived us they were not setting you up for success.
good,"Overall, my experience working was great, and the company does treat its employees well. It’s just a regular retail company, so there isn’t much bad I can say about the company. I"
good,"The location I worked for had a very high turn over rate across the board in leadership and sales associates. There wasn't a consistent team effort , there was lack of leadership, lack of integrity, lack of drive, and it wasn't being taken seriously in my opinion. The managers that performed their duties also performed the other managers duties just too keep the store going. Theft internal and external was never resolved properly so we held on to managers and employees that were dishonest and even in some ways bullying with statements written and reported through the years that I worked here and still nothing was done. The company spreads managers and employees thin by sending them to fix other stores or by not fixing the store that is having issues. As long as numbers are there it doesn't seem to matter."
good,"Unorganized"
good,"I am sad that this store sell more on line than in the stores. The quality of the clothes specially in the POLO line have been downgraded. "
good,There was nothing particularly difficult with the work.  It was always a game of who knows more and what do we need to tell people.  I've always thought that being honest and fair would in turn produce honesty and fair work from those that worked for me and with me.
good,"La empresa tiene grandes campos de aprendizaje.Se puede llegar a obtener un gran conocimiento sobre todos los campos de atención al cliente. "
good,"I was pleased to work at Ralph Lauren to learn how a big famous brand is organized and work. To learn how an American company is managing a team, this is a very different culture than our French companies. That was very interesting"
good,"A typical day depends on you shift. If you come in at 4 or 5 am you'll be breaking down truck, so opening boxes of new merchandise and adding censors to items that need them. If you come in an hour or two before open, you'll most likely be straightening up the store until open. During store hours, you'll either be a cashier, ""salesperson"", dressing room or in the backroom looking for more sizes for the sales people. Dressing room you will be helping customers with suggesting items to go with their purchases, getting new sizes from the floor, and folding clothes that were tried on. Sales people will be trying to up-sale items and helping customers find styles and sizes, when they aren't with customers they will be straightening the store. I was there for about 6 months and I never saw one person be promoted, but they did bring in two or three managers from outside the store. They also will not give you very many hours, I was picking up hours to get more and got in trouble for going over 30 hours."
good,some of the people there were super nice  to work with and others not so much and many people left because of someone in management. i leaned good customer service there
good,No se entiende la vida personal. Ninguna ayuda para compaginarlo.
good,The managers here just need to communicate better and actually work but other than that it was a good environment and great for a first or temporary job.
good,Face paced corp environment that has gone through a lot of restructuring recently. From my experience there was a tight family atmosphere in the beginning but then with the multiple restructures and swapping of CEO things began to feel very unsure. The vacation and paid time off was great though.
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,"If you like crazy schedules and a fast pace environment, this is the place for you.  The downfall to this business is, only one weekend off a month and you can guarantee that your two days off will not be consecutive.  During the holidays expect a lot of late nights and overnights."
good,I only worked here to have money for college. It is a fast paced very professional type of environment. The management was okay with a bit of micromanaging. Doing floor sets was probably the best part of the job since we would stay overnight to bring out the new styles for the season.
good,It was very easy work. I learned lots about stock and organization and time management. I wasn't a fan of the management. The workplace wasn't bad I enjoyed many of the other associates I worked with.
good,"ralph lauren can be a good company to work for if you are just a regular associate. As far as management, it is very overbearing and they make you feel belittled"
good,This job helped me how to be more open and talk to people to create a better relationship with the customer.The experience there is a slow paced environment with really high standards.
good,"You are hired through a temporary agency. You never know how long your job assignment will be. Your lucky if you get a placement that last more than 3 months. You are working along side permanent employees doing the same work, they are paid more. Sometimes you work harder."
good,"Customer service oriented"
good,"Rapid paced and stressful work environment with loose management styles.  Inter-communication between related departments  was ""sketchy"" at best.   Employees generally handled the workload, without exaggeration, of 4-5 people.  Opportunities to advance were few and far between, with zero tuition reimbursement for school and disparities between job duties and titles within the organization.  Many employees suffered from burn-out because of the absence of respect for work/life boundaries.  Discount perks were adequate.  Regular performance reviews and helpful input and suggested strategies for personal improvement from management were non-existent.   If you get a position at RL, have an external advancement plan before you go in and stick to it.  The work environment is VERY busy and quite a bit of travel."
good,"high volume, when i started! learned quickly it was to maintain high level of product but not staffed properly so people could find it! we did good business but it was accidental not by design. people were no trained properly so they were clerking the product not selling it! you always have to maintain a level of salesmanship to be successful no matter what the level of volume."
good,"I personally had an overall positive experience working at Ralph Lauren, but in full transparency, I think that had a lot to do with the people I worked with/for, 90% of whom no longer work there. I think the company's biggest problems come from the top down. Like most giant brands, there is major resistance to change. Most of the senior executives have been there for decades and believe they know best. It's difficult to influence that mentality. I think this company needs a major change of leadership. Ralph is a brilliant visionary, but perhaps it's time to step aside and let a new generation lead the way."
good,"I liked working at Ralph Lauren, but the location of my store was not the best, and it seemed at if some of the employees and management choose favorites."
good,"Great ppl, great customers, paid weekly, but as a temp qualified for 0 benefits, 0 discounts, and when they started cutting ppl after the season ended, it was random selection rather than a look a your work thus far and how well you fit as an employee. And your supervisors could NOT give you refs or recs no matter how much they tried  (and they did) but temps could not even get those."
good,A fast paced and energetic job placement where you will learn how to deal with many tasks at once. You will learn to cope with various job titles as becoming an employee or sales associate does not mean that you will only be required to do a specific job.
good,My schedule was never consistent. The manager took a long period of time to enter my name and information into the polo ralph Lauren system. This was very irritating because it meant that I would have to wait for an override from a manager before I was able to clock back into work.
good,"For all the years that I work in Polo I learn a lot."
good,Ralph Lauren is definitely a great first job. Although it is extremely hard to move up or even grow at all. Took 4 years to move out of sales floor when I asked many times to learn BOH operations.
good,From my time working here I have learned more than I ever thought I would have learned when I first started. great fun working environment and the company Is very hands on with the community.
good,"Since this business is centered in a tourist destinations employees are constantly bombarded by people from all around the world. Tourism including people with different morals, colors, languages ,and cultures.It is very interesting seeing all of the races and how different and alike we really are. Meeting so many different people and trying to communicate with them is definitely the best part of the job."
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,"Extremely poor/rude management. Very disrespectful towards their employees and seek no time of day to help solve issues that may occur. The salary was amazing but due to the level of disrespect you face, did not seem worth it."
good,"Overall, RL Corporation is a great company that has been around for years and is continuing to grow.  The Contact Center is fairly new in comparison with the rest of the company, and that is evident.  There are still some growing pains, but overall is a good place to work."
good,Ralph Lauren organization is not a collaborative environment. The overall culture is every man for themselves. But the brand is strong and will last forever. There has been several changes in management therefore hoping to see a shift in company culture.
good,"went from part time to full time"
good,"This was a job that I began while in school.  It was something to allow me to begin gaining work experience.  I left due to finding a better job with benefits.  The store was good, they just only paid minimum wage and the yearly raises weren't much either.   Management was good, but they never focused on employee development much which is huge for me."
good,"a typical retail job. very boring and tedious."
good,"Low compensation compared to the market; company protects senior level and not below.  The culture is great, everyone loves the brand and you can ""drink the cool-aid"" but underneath, senior management is secretive."
good,"There are many great benefits to working for Ralph Lauren... Job security, good benefits and a rich cultural history. Unfortunately, Ralph Lauren has grown extremely large and as result, there is a lot of mismanagement caused by too many ""decision makers"" with only partial control and often time opposing views."
good,This was one of my first jobs it really helped me break out of my shell and handle peoples needs.
good,"A typical day at Ralph Lauren would be, serving & advising customers. Giving them full knowledge of products, sizes, stock availability & current selling price. "
good,"Most days I worked we slow because I was in highschool and couldn't have a lot of hours but when I worked weekends it was a mad house. I learned that people from other countries like to haggle prices with you.. other people like to steal.. I would guess I became more vigilant and focused on what customers want or need. To provide ""discipline"" to customers when needed. The managers? Often I had no idea where they were... Often in the office, not on the sales floor. You couldn't really tell the difference and there were so many managers that you had know idea which one you were speaking to. They did give me a set schedule to I could plan my events and school around it.  Co-workers, they were more worried about their phones than anything else. Nobody really got to know one another. The hardest thing about the  job was the amount of work you had to do without the help of the managers when it was obvious you need them. And the schedule wouldn't be sent out until last minute or you didn't receive it. Um, the food court was close, Nathan's is my favorite."
good,"I enjoyed my time working there starting out, but after a couple of weeks of being there I began to dislike a lot of things. Including the supervisors unprofessional comments!! That's why I left there. My time there was short, but I benfitted from the experience and environment. Next time I know to suck it up and take critism!"
good,"My typical day consists of maintaining customer relations either by phone or through mail, (snail, or internet). "
good,"Was a perfect first job out of high school. Although, the people who worked there were all really nice and helpful, anything beyond that I don't see why people would stay. They have way too many employees so you never get enough hours and schedules are often shifted around so they can avoid paying any overtime."
good,A typical day on the job would be me folding clothes and putting them away also helping the customers that would come into the store. The co-workers that worked with me were very friendly and fun to work with. There was really no hard part of the job it was very easy. The most enjoyable part to me was interacting with all the different people that would come into the store.
good,"What the company stands for as a whole is wonderful but the managemnt at my location was unprofessional, inexperienced, and made the whole mood of the store negative. The turnover rate is unbelievably high. I resigned after only 4 months. In that 4 month period of time 4-5 employees also quit. That says a lot for a location that has a small staff to begin with."
good,fun working and meeting new people sometimes management was wishy washy overall a fun place to work
good,Polo is a good company to work for but they have favorites. Would like to leave at this
good,stock store floor and stock room. walk the store and assist customers with items so they may purchase them. work the cash register.
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,Average Fortune 500 Company. If you want decent benefits and other perks this is the company for you.
good,"Good place to work. Fast-paced so always something to do, especially on weekends, good colleagues (not management) I've made friends for life there. Management team are horrendous, treat people of lower positions like they're literally below them. No care for staff below them despite mental health support and work support that they provide. Physically, the management do not care. Aside from this, good benefits and rewards. Good discounts, 30% for friends and family 4 times a year, too."
good,Permet de développer des connaissances dans le domaine de la mode et du service à la clientèle/ conseil .
good,Winkel was altijd DRUK en ROMMELIG (kan ook liggen aan de locatie!) Werkdruk is hoog maar is voornamelijk opvouwen van kleding. Management was niet op de hoogte van dingen. Andere werkgerelateerde dingen waren slecht geregeld. De weekplanning liep raar (begon op zondag) en salaris was niet al te best.
good,"WAS a great team environment.  Staff were reliable, great with customers, hard working and supportive of each other and management. Unfortunately the morale changed when a new store manager and district manager came on board. Typical negative personalities, very demanding and unrealistic with their expectations and at times verbally abusive to other managers and sales associates. Yelling and bullying should not be accepted in the workplace and should not be tolerated. I put in a complaint to hr and nothing was done about it."
good,"When you work here the schedule you have is what it is, theres really not a say if you need first or second shift the shift you get is what your stuck on, Even with a request it wont go far, the only way to really move up in this company is if they want you there"
good,"Company offers employee benefits that help maintain work-life balance, especially when considering family growth. But management could be better at managing different personalities and consider various ways of empowering those around them."
good,"My issues at Ralph Lauren were not based on the company itself, rather some unscrupulous employees. Overall great company. Handle customer with care and you'll succeed within company."
good,"Mooie kleding! Als personeel word er van je verwacht dat je het merkt draagt bij nieuwe collectie ontvang je weinig korting en bij de outlet wel meer. "
good,"I like to my manager and all the assistant managers. Scheduling is always a sticky wicket. Compensation was lousy, discounts were great! I’m sure people would have stayed, other then the HS kids if there was fair compensation and benefits that were actually benefits."
good,"Having the opportunity to work with a high end product, learning new ways of presentability,  expanding the knowledge on fashion and putting outfits together as a stylist."
good,"They did not use their empoyees to their best abilities. Some managers at the time of my employment were rude and hateful. Other than these few fauts this is a job that I brag about having, it was a higher esteemed job for the area. However, I wish there were more areas of advancement."
good,Job location was located close to home and coworkers were friendly to work with.  They were helpful when I had an issue at hand that I had questions about.
good,"A day a Ralph Lauren would consist of calling customers and selling on the floor.  You were not able to get overtime unless you had prior approval, not accounting for accidental incidents.  The culture was nice, but all depends upon the people.  I enjoyed the product and people I worked with and sacrificed pay and benefits.  The culture was focused on transactional customers and selling multiple units.  Overall, the people and product are amazing, but the benefits are marginal."
good,"i learned how to pack , a day at work would usually go good. the job was easy , just a repetitive process. pick up a crate , match the collate , scan the collate , scan the item then box it up and package it"
good,great learning experience in a fast paced enviornment. Offers the opportunity for advancement withing and the ability to meet a lot of people from all walks of life.
good,"High production, multi phone call environment.  Not a lot of communicated policies or procedures.  Because of this, I was given the freedom to develop procedures as needed."
good,Not a good working environment. Managers are horrible. Learned a great deal of the industry. Hardest part of the job is working with nasty people. They need to hire fresh new managers with open way of thinking
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,I enjoyed my time there.  Unfortunately I was a victim of a large scale lay-off.  The company isn't a bad place to work though.  I would return if the opportunity presented itself.
good,"This was a starter job.  I was trying to upgrade in the process of my employment here for better job opportunities.  There was not much work involved, so the benefits were nonexistent."
good,I feel like I had the most growth as an individual in this company because I had no growth in my career. Navy and Denim Dress Code becomes monotonous and old. Coworkers would either lift you up or tear you down however they saw fit. Some higher management is great and wants to see you happy but others just care about the numbers. I am not just another body in a store. Treat employees as people and maybe they would stay longer.
good,Working at Ralph Lauren is reasonable for the turn-out. What you out in is what you get out. Very relaxed job but long days relaxed can turn out to be boring if you work 8+ hours a day. This is a GREAT job if your are a high school student or college pastime student trying to rake in some cash
good,I learned how to manage and operate a 4.5 Million dollar retail business. I learned  how to maximize my controllables and to be aware of the business metrics. Started off as part time associate and in about 13 months became part of their management team as the selling manager. Cons os they have a lot of turnover and tend to faded away from standards and turn the other cheek to real issues and too much micro management lack of communication.
good,"Senior/mid managers on key positions are completely unqualified for their positions. It creates a very surreal work environment and antagonism among teams."
good,The manager staff there should be reviewed. Some of them are horrible. They continue to hire nothing but high school students and wonder why they are short staffed alot
good,"Although you had to deal with the chaos of working in Bicester Village, all of the staff got along really well and there are ways to work your way up to bigger roles."
good,"The only reason I have stuck it out for so long is because having this name on my resume is great for future employers.  Partly because I think that they know how hard this company works their employees.  I also will leave here with twice as much knowledge, if not more, than when I came in a few years ago.  I say that because you really are forced to learn, because you wear quite a few hats in this company.  Each department is extremely understaffed and required to do way more than the standard work load.  A typical day is answering emails with overseas offices, and then running from meeting to meeting, until it's 5 o'clock, and you finally get to sit down at your desk to do your work.  Upper management seems to have all of the time in the world, because they sit and waste valuable time in meetings talking about where they went shopping that weekend, or where they want to rent their vacation house this summer.  Mind you, the majority of us who do the work, receive very unfair wages.  I, myself, have two jobs.  Credit is rarely given where credit is due."
good,"I worked at the Ralph Lauren Factory Store for a little over a year and a half. It was one of my favorite work experiences. Management team is to the point and gets things done, the harder you work the more you are rewarded in hours and important tasks."
good,"This job was okay to work I did work there for 3 years, and overall I wish there would be better way and more hours , overall this job was good at the time but it is nothing I recommend long term"
good,"I have worked for this company twice; once as a full-time employee, and then again as a temporary employee. I must say that I enjoyed the work (pick-pack & put-to-light). I have often wondered to myself if Ralph Lauren knew the kind of people that were managing his companies. I have never worked with some many people in managerial positions that no interpersonal relationship skills. Some of the comments that were made to some of the employees, permanent and temporary alike were nothing short of grounds for lawsuits. It is a fun place to work, but it would be a much more inviting place to work if those that are in positions of authority would learn how to harness their pride."
good,"A typical day at work was very busy, tasks would include replenishing and offering customer service. While working there, I learned patience. Management was at times unorganized, communication skills were needed. There we no hard parts of the job, the most enjoyable part; however, would be helping and getting to know people."
good,its a ok company to work for. the pay is decent just don't have much of a work life balance. work hard and you should be able to be promoted. managers work with your schedule.
good,"Poor people management."
good,A typical work day was folding clothes and assisting customers in the fitting rooms. I learned about customer service and about how to set up a store so that it is more appealing to the customers. The management was okay but changing a lot. My coworkers were awesome. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers at times. The best part of the job was the discount we got on the clothes.
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,"The company is one of the largest corporate fashion edifices in the industry, but is struggling to find its identity and relevance in today's market. Thus, the management structure and synchronization of daily workflow suffers. It's a great learning experience, but it may not be the company where one can ""climb the ladder."""
good,Overall a very positive work environment with managment and coworkers. We had our ups and downs but that's with every job. I learned a lot about the application of technology in retail and was able to observe some of the most powerful sales staff in my career to date.
good,Its a fun place to work but there is no career growth opportunities available. Pay is bit lower then others companies in same industry despite the experience.
good,Nous somme pas vendeur mais plieur de vêtements c'est dommage pour une boutique considéré comme haut de gamme
good,"Consistency on helping with all departments, very fast paced environment.Review stock inventory and plan for shipment following 2 days. Great Co-workers with great communication. Hardest part of the job was keeping up with the flow of traffic, while maintaining the Ralph Lauren Experience."
good,"Hectic work days during the weekends, but slow during the week which allowed for time to replenish and make sure the store was clean. When the store was busy it made the day go by faster, which was the best part about working there."
good,Same everyday  hardest part is the hours I wish they were better and no days off the people and management are great the part is that your working towards something
good,Ralph Lauren is an excellent brand and you can tell the employees take great pride in working for the company. But they are known to be lower pay compared to competitors.
good,Building relations with clients is always fun but when you show up to work and there is no money to make it becomes discouraging. This particular location has no room for growth but enjoyed my time there
good,"You have to be at work at 6 a.m. and be ready to hear and do the days goal at the morning meeting. after that your day will stay at a consistent fast pace and only stop for restroom/lunch  break. normally the goal is about 30,000 or more."
good,Associates are held to a very high standard which leads to the turnover rate being high. Associates and management are expected to stay long after midnight to prepare the store for the following day while we are technically only scheduled till 11pm.
good,"Working at Ralph Lauren was productive. It was always busy, even when the store was running low there were always things to do like tidy up and fix the clothes. A typical day were to fix the shelves and/or be a cashier and check people out. The things I've learned is customer service. The co- workers there were very friendly and I enjoyed working with them."
good,"Working for Ralph Lauren's premier flagship you get to see a lot of moving parts that make Ralph Lauren the premier luxury fashion brand of the world. With that you're conditioned to manage through constant changes with corporate partners in and out of the building, conditioned to manage execution on these constant changes at the blink of an eye and conditioned to always be on your toes; support the needs of the partners in the building. "
good,"The culture of the company that was talked up so much prior to my on boarding, was virtually non existent at my location. I don't doubt the company prides itself on a family like work enivornment but I must say, it did not happen at my former store. General managers need to be held more accountable and held to same standard as other leaders within the organization. A bias and favorited workplace can be very uncomfortable."
good,"was only a seasonal job so I wasn't expecting much"
good,"Each day brought a new challenge. No call was the same and there were always opportunities to fix a technical problem creatively. The work environment among coworkers was friendly and helpful. It was a laid back and playful environment even though the call volume kept us on our toes. Management started playing musical chairs however and morale took a nose dive when new and negative things were implemented. The pay was wonderful, the raises were fair, and the benefits package was one of the best."
good,Ralph Lauren is an established brand with a great reputation. I am glad to have had a great 4 years with the company so far.
good,Very long hours. Half the management are actually helpful and friendly but the other half seems to have it out for everyone.
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,"Working at Polo Ralph Lauren was nice. You working with great customers and friendly staff. Management, for the most part was decent but there will always be bad amongst the good A typical full day at Polo consist of unloading boxes, shelving, prepping store for opening, meeting and greeting guest when store open, make sure store is clean throughout the day."
good,"A lot of customer service, not a very possibility of promotion and low pay."
good,Greeting and helpinig customers build their wardrobe for themselves or whomever they are shopping for. Through my time with this company I've learned how to better communicate with both customers and coworkers.  Being able to be friendly and approachable is a must for retail.
good,"A typical day at Polo consists of helping out each customer and maintaing your assigned zone or section for the day. I don't know about the other Polo stores but management at store 14 is HORRIFIC. They clearly do not know how to operate there store correctly which is why they almost never meet there daily goals. Also when your shift is up they do not recognize it. For example if your shift ends at 8pm, most likely you will not leave until about 8:45, and no you ARE NOT getting paid for that extra time. My co-workers on the other hand are like my second family. The hardest part of the job was trying to assist customers who do not speak English."
good,I enjoyed working in Sales but I jostle enjoyed greeting customers.  I wanted more of a career.
good,"I have been working there since August and things were great, until the holiday season when they over hired people and then after the holidays started cutting everyone's hours, I am not lucky to get 4 hours week working there, which is not good when you have a child to support, I would not recommend this as a job for anyone other then the college student or high student.......if you aren't in the click at the Mebane location then you aren't given the hours or the freedom like the ones in the click.....advancement is even harder, even if you have the skills and background to move up."
good,"They pay very well at this company, but the particular store that I worked in is very unorganized.  There are not enough hours in the day to get your job done.  I only continue to stay with this company because I have a chance to be a store manager and I will turn the place around."
good,I worked stock here and didn't really see much of the sales floor except for merchandising. I learned basic business practices here and how to keep a stock room well organized. Management basically kept to themselves here and did little to help just gave orders and sat in the back. My co-workers were hard working and did their jobs great. Hardest part of this job was getting or keeping my hours as there were too many people working here. I mostly enjoyed the work I did on my own by myself off in the back.
good,"Long and boring"
good,Great Company! Management could improve some along with some of the ways they train.
good,"el trabajo fue bueno, el trabajo confortable y los compañeros no eran los peores."
good,"RL is a good place to make connections, discover different cultures while dealing with people from all over the world."
good,"I would clock in and report to management for tasks needed to be done at that point in time. I would assist customers, work on stock, answer phones, take messages, do daily reports and deposits. The management was very qualified and friendly. My co-works made the time pass quickly. They were fun to be around and great to work with. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with customers who had constent complaints. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to go above and beyond the customers expectations."
good,"Learning the world of logistics was exciting, challenging and sometimes fun. I wish there was less favoritism and more fairness."
good,Overall good company with a nice outlook.Good working envirment.Close friends that bonded together.
good,"Ho lavorato da Ralph Lauren a Bicester Village (UK), grande shopping center sito a metà strada tra Oxford e Londra. Esperienza molto intensa dal punto di vista culturale e linguistica (ho lavorato con mezzo mondo), ma - a mio avviso - tappa di passaggio per chi vuole costruire una carriera nel retail. Lo consiglierei ad una persona giovane e dinamica, giusto per formarsi."
good,Zusammenhalt unter den Mitarbeitern ist gut. Büros in zentraler Lage
good,Ralph Lauren is a good starter job as it doesn't require any previous experience to work there. the pay is higher than most places with the same requirements.
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,productive place to work with a lot of high pressure and demand. will always keep you on your toes so it can make the day go a lot faster. be prepared for a challange
good,I worked and made friends while working. positive atmosphere felt good to work there. the managers helped out if needed. Best part was coming to the end of the day to see if we made the quota of the day always pushes us to do better the next day.
good,"A typical workday would consist of greeting customers, handling cash wrap and replenishing products on the sales floor. I learned what it takes in order to make a sale and manage the cash wrap."
good,"A typical workday consists of providing the customers with a great service.   This would include helping customers out, cash register duties, cleaning the department."
good,"It was awesome for a 17 year old first job. They definitely underpay. But i was grateful for the pocket change. I met a lot of great people. The job was fun and i learned a little Spanish! The majority of tourists that visit sawgrass are hispanic, spanish is great to know."
good,"Bel environnement de travail, équipe dynamique. Beaucoup d'affluence durant la période de soldes. Convient bien pour un emploi saisonnier."
good,"Working in Bicester Village can be a challenging experience, however the management were not helpful, as they treated part timers differently from full timers."
good,"excellent place to work chances to grow and move up in company."
good,"Polo Ralph Lauren is a good place to work if you are a student who needs a job with a flexible schedule, or someone who enjoys working with new fashion trends. Workplace culture and management is friendly."
good,"Fun to work at "
good,"I worked at RL prior to the retail downturn, so the culture of the company back then, vs today, is probably very different.  Add in people who have come and gone, and the changes in top leadership, I do not have much to say about the company at this point in time."
good,"i think i more enjoy being able to say that i worked for ralph lauren than whenever i actaully look back on working there. ugh so stuffy. so many sweaters, high heels, elizabethian collars, and  androgyny. yeesh."
good,working at ralph lauren was an okay experience. people there are friendly but some are really lazy. working with lazy people bothers me as i feel like i am overworking my self since other people don't do much to help.
good,Das Arbeitsklima im Ralph Lauren Store war angenehm.
good,too little pay for too much work with interesting characters at the workplace. not good hours if you plan to work full time. supervisors and managers are found arrogant at times
good,"Easy to do, but the employees form groups and can be very mean towards other employees. Management is nice but can join this groups and just be mean to you."
good,Was just a seasonal job to supplement my income I waited on customers helped customers with products I folded clothes I replenish stock I check the dressing room I processed inventory
good,"Work environment is pretty good and professional. Compensation is low compared to other industries. "
good,flexiable with hours. could be stressful. never fully staffed. you have to work weekends. poor management. you have to work under pressure. great discounts
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,Management at Ralph Lauren lacked a lot of communication and training in first few months of working there. As of right now it's in a work of progress and I've seen some improvement with a transition in general managers. The employees there were all good friends and worked together to get tasks done.
good,New manager brings down the morale of the store..She's not very approachable....................................................shes what you get when you hire outside of the company
good,"Typical workday consists of providing assistance to customers via phone, chat and email. It is a very fast paced environment in which you need to keep up with ratings and scores to advance. The culture is extremely diverse and there are a lot of volunteer opportunities with other organizations and events provided. The management team is very small and work around the clock to make sure things run smoothly. The job is super easy and all of the tools and resources you need are right at your fingertips."
good,"can be really busy, improvements can be done on the management, good team work, good staff discount, salary not good compared with the work load you have to do"
good,"Very Fast Paced work environment, need to be efficient in order to excel. Pay raises are few and far between. Some good people some lazy people. Management is ok"
good,"I worked on as a temporary employee, and my assignment is ending soon. I need a full time job with benefits and was not offered one as a temporary employee."
good,my coworkers made this job easier. I like coming here just because of them. the managers where a bit rude and seem careless about there staff. coming to work was okay.
good,I like working for Ralph Lauren. My most recent manager is awesome! It is a very relaxed place to work because as long as you meet your objectives then everything is good.
good,"I didn't enjoy the retail lifestyle and was good in the back, the would not keep me in the back of house, they forced me up front which i didn't enjoy. They also have on call shifts so you never really knew how many hours you were going to get."
good,"A typical day at work includes coordination of project tasks, daily support, and upcoming initiatives. I learned by getting involved in a variety of systems, in addition to WFM, and attending to various business needs including Point of Sale database to support BI and marketing initiatives. High urgency projects such as programming of complex tax XML interface to meet overseas tax authority requirements. Project and vendor management aspects of the job were also interesting including managing training of off-shore team. The culture is quite laid back as long as the work gets done. The most difficult part of the job is multiple changes in upper management. The most enjoyable part of the job is flexibility to learn new things."
good,i would have to wake up at 5 in the morning and be there at 6 and get off like at 1 the whole time i would be standing up except when i would take a bathroom break or when they gave us a 15 min break or when we had the lunch break which was like 30 min oh and the cafeteria is like so far from where i was station at so time would fly you had to hurry to the cafeteria hurry up and eat and hurry up and get all the way back and stand up again. sometimes they would expect us to work and other days they would tell you not to come until next notice. tho the cafeteria food was really good.
good,"The polo store its a good place to work, more if you are a college student. They give you the opportunity to take shift according to yours desire. And Managers are very  great full and kind full."
good,I didnt enjoy working here at all. I went in as a temp and felt they had the attitude of looking down on temps. The customer were generally rude also.
good,"The company is good, the experience depends on your specific location. You fold clothing practically all day, but they prioritize customer service over all."
good,"Clocking in, going up to the front finding out what area your team leader wants you to join or cover an employees lunch. Zone the designated area by folding, organizing and prioritizing the product."
good,"Ralph Lauren is a great place to work at, you learn a lot about the brand and get to connect with the rest of the employees and have a good time, if customer service is your thing I recommend it"
good,"I worked here while I was in college. Good environment, good leadership. The workers were friendly, helpful, and hard working. Everyone had an agenda each work day."
good,A work day starts off with team meeting. The plans for the night. Then we start clocking in. Then we break off to our work area. As we work till our break. repeat till lunch. then till closing time.
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,"It was contract job assigned for less than an year and completed the task."
good,working here is fun.of course it depends on the location you work at. people are generally nice. although i expect more from some of the managers. it is faced paced.
good,"To say you've worked at Bicester Village is one thing, but to say you have worked for Ralph Lauren is completely another. One of the best, if not the best brand in the village. "
good,"I Had a great experience working at RL. The atmosphere was amazing. The team leads in different departments were amazing and very welcoming. Ives learned a lot about the business through varies training , provided by the company."
good,"it was a good temporary job "
good,This job taught me proper customer service and patience.  Associates willing to learn made the job easier.  Brand standards can be demanding but if you're passionate about the product it's not bad.
good,"Polo Ralph Lauren Children's Factory Store was a great work experience with excellent staff and management. Unfortunately the company was very unorganized; for example, the weekly schedule was posted only two-three days in advance, and the company has minimal opportunities to earn raises or promotions."
good,"Not everyone was treated fairly, and somethings were more time consuming than others. The managing staff was friendly, but not of them could properly manage the other staff."
good,"I was 16 years old when I worked there. It was just like any other retail job. Customer service, folding clothes etc... I wouldn't say I would want that as a career."
good,"I enjoy retail but I had to move and leave the company. I was needing an evening or over night position, I didn't have enough hours to support my family"
good,"While I enjoyed the staff and working with with my fellow employees, the job was very boring day today. Very tiring standing all day, plus folding cloths isn't fun."
good,"Many areas, make known when you want to get involved.  Many VP's are willing to help you learn more and be involved, but you must put in the work, and time proving yourself."
good,"poor sales"
good,"Is when the costumer is satisfied with your help, this can do a questionnaire assessing the person who has helped."
good,"Keeping product neat and clean. I learned how to keep the product competitive. Located in Park City in Salt Lake City, UT so during the holiday season and SUNDANCE Festival it kept you wanting to work because the people you will encounter."
good,"Working at polo the days seamed to go by so slow. All I ever did was fold clothes all day long or restock shelves if I was tending to customers. However, all of the managers were very kind and caring."
good,It's not ideal place to work but it gets me paid  and it not a hard place to work and kind of relaxing to be there just talking to customers and getting to know them
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,"- helping customer who needs someone to make their outfits "
good,"I had a great experience with the people and the company, but as a result of such a large portion of their employees being employed there for 10+ years, they are stuck in the mindset of ""this is how it's always been done"" and it's difficult to initiate large-scale changes.  There are lots of meetings and things move slowly (for better or worse)."
good,Chill retail job nothing compares to an upbeat restaurant theyre very laid back this is a perfect job for a high school student since they give you around 20 hours per week
good,"Morale is very low; management is lacking; working are not motivated.  No one is motivated to get things done quickly, or efficiently.  Years ago, company was in a much better place than today."
good,"I enjoy working with my fellow colleagues. I find that most people who work here are likable and genuine. On the other hand, there is little to no face time with executives and I have had 4 different presidents in 5 years. "
good,Polo Ralph Lauren's was good a Job although they could use some fixing up which they have over the years and I had fun going to work being able to dress in my favorite brand and help customers who admired my style get there's Together

good,"I worked at Polo Ralph Lauren for 3 years. I started as a temporary floor associate who would mainly assist customers, to moving up to a part-time cashier associate. As a cashier associate, my main duties were to open and close register tills, maintain the operations at the front of the store, while assisting customer transactions. After being a cashier associate I became promoted to full-time women's associate and visual merchandiser. My main duties for that position was to train and direct the women's sales team for their daily duties while assisting customers on the floor. The visual merchandising position included working with the managers over nights 9pm-5am to update the mannequins and to update the signs and floor to the correct directive and sales promotions. After going back to school I became a part-time stock associate who would come in early hours before store opening to unbox new product and organize the stockroom."
good,"sales, budgettering, aansturen van personeel, inwerken van nieuw personeel, voorraad beheer, balansen, interieur beheer"
good,"A typical day at work involved greeting customers at the door, running the cash register, organizing clothes in the back as well as in the front and make sure the customer is not only finding what they need but enjoying the customer service"
good,It is most of all an inspirational brand and company and it is also a relatively good company. It is a relaxed workplace and the staff and camaraderie make every day enjoyable. It is very international and you learn a lot from each other. I learned a lot about the industry. The hardest part is its heavy administration and sometimes lack of honest communication from Management.
good,Fun experience but was beneath my experience. Was not what i was looking for in a job. Could have been better if more room for growth. Line did not do well at location
good,"I was with the Company during a wonderful growth period, and learned new skills and had many great experiences.  Unfortunately, the Company is currently struggling to revive itself and has downsized.  All in all, I enjoyed my 10 years at Ralph Lauren and sincerely hope the Company achieves its new ""Way-forward""  turn-around strategy."
good,"IT is dead for this company, move along..."
good,"I enjoyed working here. The work environment was nice, I was able to work my way around several departments, because I am a quick learner and a person that is easy to teach."
good,"Overall I was paid very well, but the company expectations were beyond achievable.    I learned a great deal but at the end of the day, trying to have a family life and working the hours required were not working for my family."
good,the answer would be the same as i just previously wrote . the answer doesn't vary . it was great working and meeting various vendors and managing a team but it be3came redundant
good,"Not much room to advance, the job is easy and a fun place to work. The clothing is the best part, its very nice to work with the top of the line. Good for a side job in college."
good,"I worked with many great people here. The job can be very rewarding and, at the time at least, management took an interest in developing a specific sales skill set."
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,"I enjoy working at Polo, the personal interaction with the customers. I enjoy supervising the shipping process. Also resetting the sales floor as the seasonal/product changes. Get to meet and work with so many different personalities."
good,"very friendly, caring place. Hard working. working with RF guns unloading trucks. Scan products and unloading into stock room. customer friendly, folding clothes."
good,Working for a company that specializes in quality clothing. Providing customer service in daily interactions with customers.
good,"Great company to work for, nice products, and great brand; however management could be better. I recommend and wouldn't mind going back."
good,it was a nice place to work. the supervisors and everybody were nice and friendly. The only problem is that you walk constantly. No sitting down until you go on break.
good,"Its fun but don't expect to many hours and do not apply if you cant handle dealing with obnoxious people. Its a good second job or a good job if you are going to school but if you need to make money or want to follow a career, find somewhere else."
good,"Overall, stable company. Start temporary associate then if liked enough and good hard worker will become permanent after a year or more. Some have worked there for five years making nine dollars an hour before becoming permanent doing much harder work than working at a dependable company or stable steady business."
good,Polo is great place to build customer service skills. Working closely with coworkers and management results in a positive work environment and culture.
good,"Die tijd had ik veel over uren gewerkt en bijna 10uren staan ook heen en weer lopen."
good,"This was a great expirence to work for and company."
good,"I fear that I held this position quite some time ago and it would be unfair to judge it as so much time has passed since I was involved with this particular sector of Ralph Lauren. However, over all I enjoyed the company."
good,"Nice working environment, Very fast paste at times but subtle on certain days. I got along with a lot of my coworkers."
good,"This was my first job, I only worked there for two months. I learned to worked a register and customer service. It was the only retail job I really had so it was a good first job."
good,"I enjoyed my time there. Everyone was very professional and working in retail and customer service for the holiday season will teach a person, to great lengths, how important it is to stay patient, professional, and always look on the bright side."
good,"Working in retail taught me a lot about responsibility. Being given mutiple jobs taught me how to balance different tasks, I went from stocking, to the register, to customer service all throughout the day. It was a place to work for."
good,"The job was fine but, it was just that, a job. There were a lot of young people between the age of 18 to 22 working. Now that i am older, i am now looking for a career , but i did not see that happening with this company."
good,"RL is a very prestigious company to work for and after working here, you will feel proud to say you did. The company cares about its legacy and the footprint they leave in the ""sand""."
good,Great overall experience! First in class at teaching retail standards an overall customer service. Great opportunity for forward movement.

good,"answer customers questions about products"
good,"Very physical warehouse work, co workers help each other out, can cross train, occasional opportunity to learn other job positions"

good,"Laid back call center...."
good,"they had a good weekly pay rate"
good,Helped customers. Did whatever was needed of me as per the usual retail environment. Decent overall experience. Would work there again if the pay wasn't so low.
good,Gave me the opportunity to develop my people skills and costumer service skills. I was for the first time able to operate a cash register and gained the basic knowledge of working a job since this was my first one.
good,"Great company and Benifits."
good,"Very few development opportunities and visibility to management."
good,"Good company with good discounts, shorts breaks, lack of hours, bad management, and the heathcare isn't all that either."
good,"A typical day as a cashier is awesome. You meet new people from different countries and different languages. As a cashier for 1+ year at Ralph Lauren, I have learned to become a more productive person and a better team player. However the management team at Ralph Lauren is a disgraced to the company. My co-workers are very intellectual colleges. We work and Play hard to make Ralph Lauren what it is. The hardest part of my job is being able to drive sales especially on a slow day, but the most enjoyable part of my days at work is getting to meet people from all over the world and getting to know them personally as a person."
good,I enjoyed my time there.wish I was able to work longer..I feel that the location I was at just didnt have enough cliental coming through the store within the hours I played a part in; but overall I enjoyed my job
good,"Very stiff environment, double standards regarding certain employess which make for an uncomfortable working atmosphere"
good,"Sometimes it's a stressful atmosphere, however I love maintaining my HR functions  and providing support to other departments."
good,I booked appointment for clients.  Processed payment for services rendered.  I was also responsible for washing/folding laundry.  I was assigned to open the store and close the store.

good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,It was an interesting job to have and I learned a lot from my co workers.
good,"A typical day at work was consistently hectic and full of pressure. I learned that companies have sales goals to meet and management will push you to the limit to make that happened. Management was kinda cool, but very uptight at times. They never gave positive feedback and very critical even when you do things right. Co-workers were cool, they were a lot of people on staff so I didn't talk to all of them but we helped each other do well. The hardest part was dealing with managers telling you to do your job better when you already did it perfectly how they told you to. The most enjoyable part of the job was the pay, a lot of places do not pay $9.00/hour for seasonal sales associates."
good,I learned how to handle cash sales along with dealing with the public.I learned how to use a cash register and how to fold high cost fashion merchandise.
good,The hardest part about this job was when it became slow. Days were long and interactions were few.  The most enjoyable part about this job was the variety of people I was able to meet on a regular basis.
good,HR for HR and other shared service functions supporting leadership in all aspects of talent development and management.
good,RL is a great place to start your career.  Its kind of like boot camp- you learn a lot while working really hard on important things.  Everyone is really NICE.  Its a very collaborative atmosphere.
good,"The supervisor always had a start-up meeting with the associates, letting us know what floor we were working on that day and how much product was available to pick. Once the meeting was finished, we went to get our gladiator, tape gun, a cart, and a set of labels to start with. Management was decent, always caring and more than willing to work with you through a situation. Co-workers were friendly and very good when it came  to helping one another. I believe that the hardest part of the job was rushing to make production when business was slow and working the long 9 hour shifts when work was heavy. Other than that, the most enjoyable part of my day was taking lunch. I got to rest my feet for a few minutes and got to associate with friends (co-workers)."
good,Ralph Lauren is a great organization and brand. The best was the product and the way they present the stores to the consumer. I learned visual standards from this brand.
good,Did not like this job at all. Very short hours and rude managers and co-workers. I would not work here again.
good,"Any job can be stressful a lot of times, but in all I enjoyed it I learned a lot through the mistakes I made and through the things I did very well"
good,This was an interesting job in the fact you were helping people to build wardrobes and purchase high end products.Management was very detail oriented and the hardest part of the job was speaking from a script. The most enjoyable part of the job was making customers happy.
good,Experience gained in the showroom which helped me get my current role
good,"I worked closely with others helping them choose merchandise."
good,Great place to learn your business basics. They go in detail about what it takes to run a successful business.
good,"worked with clothing, customer service, inventory, cashier"
good,It was like everyone was robots when working you couldn't really talk much to each other it was strictly work. They did not offer much advancements. As a high school student it was actually a pretty good first job.
good,I was a sales associate so a typical day of work I would be talking to customers to see if they needed help finding anything or looking in the back for sizes for them. I would also work as a cashier when it was needed.  I learned from this job mostly how to interact with complete strangers to try to accommodate them as best as possible. Management was authoritative but it was understandable because of how large the company was.  There was one manager that seemed like their job was to just find things that people were doing wrong no matter what they were doing or how hard they were trying to work hard for the company. I enjoyed the people I worked with at Ralph Lauren.  Hardest part of the job was talking to complete strangers but I got used to it by the end. The most enjoyable part at the same time was meeting some interesting people both that came in the store and that I worked with.
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,Brand Presentation Management and customer date services
good,you learn a great deal of different function as well as how to operate machinery ...in the factory thats is.the worst thing about the job is that im a temp and its very hard to advance up in the buisness no matter how hard you work. who you know is the key
good,Very high volume store that constantly keeps you busy serving to satisfy customers
good,learned a lot by working here would not minded working here again.
good,"learned a lot about stocking, inventory, and customer service"
good,This was a seasonal job. It was busy only on weekends. There's was no fun just work
good,"Great product, but needs a better culture and environment. Some days were very unproductive and management was unreliable at times."
good,"Working directly with the inventory control team during overnight floor movements, processing shipments, and allocating product throughout the store."
good,A typical day at work would consist of maintaining the stock room and shipping out the items that needed to be shipped for the day. My co workers were enjoyable but we were constantly micromanaged. I would say the most enjoyable part of the job was the discounts and the hardest part of the job was being micromanaged.
good,"easy work, safe environment. Consistent work but it was temporary. "
good,"Polo is okay for what it is. I didn't have too much trouble with the people, but they are not for the employees. "
good,"typical work day includes standing, walking, problem solving, communication with management.  "
good,"You spent the whole time helping customers."
good,Call center environment
good,"At Ralph Lauren, work consisted of providing customer service, informing all customers on current promotions and sales, while maintaining the store clean and properly sized. Most would consider working in retail to be a hassle but I genuinely enjoyed helping people and also making sure we made our daily plan as well as converting as many customers as we can. I learned a great deal about customer service, product knowledge, clothing styles, trends, and seasonal fashion. I learned how to properly process clothing and conduct inventory checks. I enhanced my knowledge of the cash register from my previous experience at Tony's NY Pizza. Management was consistent throughout my first year there but as the store went through some changes and managers were switched around and there were some outside hires, I wasn't convinced that the company was too invested in their current employees and didn't feel that management provided the best solutions to either individual or group problems. My co-workers were either in high school, or right out of high school so working with a younger, less mature crowd wasn't the right fit for me, although most were friendly and welcoming. The hardest part of the job were the overnights, which involved a small group of about 10-15 employees going in anywhere between 7-9 p.m. and staying until 5-9 a.m. depending on what tasks we had to complete. The work itself wasn't difficult, just the day or two after when you either had to work while getting your sleep schedule back in sync. The most enjoyable part of the job was being busy helping customers. I've met several"
good,great environment and great company benefits/perks. Company is always helping out with volunteering and walks to raise money for Breast cancer and other philanthropic event.
good,Short hours.
good,Big corporation with lots of opportunity. People work hard and are interested in achieving results.
good,This job is just like any other retail job hours are usually long and the pay is alright
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,A typical day at work is helping customers with select clothings answer phones and checking cusotmers out. I learned how to assist customers and how to provide satisfactory customer service. My co-workers were very friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was understanding travelors from different countries.
good,Didn't mind the type of work I did. But heavily overloaded. We had three people to do the work of about 8.
good,Excellent opportunity to learn about the fashion industry while still working in photography.
good,its a cool job and a good way of learning bout the productivity of a respectiable company
good,Assist with new hire and ongoing development training.
good,"This position is very similar to the ""Polo Ralph Lauren Children's"" sales position. It is very heavily based on customer service. The atmosphere is pleasant, but this store does become very busy on nearly every weekend and holiday."
good,"A typical day at work in this store would be customer service, neatly folding clothing, and at times tasking such as stock management/cashier. The main focus of this job is customer service, first and foremost. Because the location I worked at was new, the management was still trying to work out some kinks. Co-workers are very friendly, which makes the atmosphere one of the most enjoyable parts of this job. There really isn't anything difficult to this job, save the occasional heavy lifting if you happen to be working in stock."
good,I love my co-worker they are like family.I learned how to give great customer service
good,Ralph Lauren is a great place to work. The company overall is agreat if you are looking to work in the fashion industry.
good,I enjoyed working for the company and learning the work routines as well as seeing such a large company operate and meeting such a large and diverse working environment.
good,A typical day at work is busy. You will never get board. There is always something to do. Learning something new is always around the corner. The diversity in customers and employees gives you opportunity to meet new people
good,"When things are going smoothly, this is a great place to work. They pay you for your birthday, have a lot of promotions that the staff can enjoy and they like to send special gifts for the employees. "
good,I acquired the necessary interpersonal skills with this team in a new market and developed a keen understanding of multi cultural differences and how to communicate a core culture to the turkish work force.
good,"fun place to work, cool culture everyone is high energy and management is good. Most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with. Tough being a host and seeing a-lot of money be made by servers and bartenders."
good,"It was very fast-paced, and competitive because the company have policies for monitoring how many orders you get done individually, and you had to obtain an average rate in order to continue working there."
good,"All colleagues are extremely bubbly and friendly, always there to given advance or any further training you feel like you need. There is a lot of staff that is expected - a whole new range of people each shift"
good,The position required constantly climbing a lot of stairs as the stock room was upstairs and the staircase was just so high. We were not allowed to sit even for a minute when our feet actually hurt and even when we were ahead of schedule with the things that need to be done. Sometimes being allocated in changing rooms or in the shop floor can be time-dragging as that means only folding clothes for hours and hours without having the permission to talk to colleagues even while two of you are folding clothes side by side. The rules are incredibly strict up to a ridiculous level for such a job position.
good,It is a fun place to work. Day to day work is really busy as a lot of customers come in. It is a great place to start your career in sales. Though there are no growth opportunities.
good,"this place is cool for students and people who don't have a lot of financial responsibility. management was nice and understanding. only con is overnights, and 5am shifts."
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,The warehouse  I worked it didn’t work weekend a lot  The managers seem to be caring about the employees I liked it early start at six in the morning to 2.30 in the evening
good,"It was cool while i was staying with my mom but it wouldnt pay much now need something that makes 10.50 13.00 dollars an hour factory,  store  anything"
good,"People are constantly leaving, turnover is great. The environment is bleak. No one talks to anybody. It's a very competitive environment where people are overworked."
good,"El ambiente entre trabajadores, independientemente la jerarquía, es muy bueno. Te facilitan tus  acontecimientos personales con el laboral."
good,"The company culture was very fast paced, but forced me to become more organized and learn how to effectively execute under pressure. My Manager was very communicative and supportive."
good,"Average company, stress filled, desire to make things happen. Good people and great discounts on clothes. People didn't work as a team as everyone were trying to protect their own jobs,"
good,"Ensured a good rotation of the different departments. This helped with the completion of tasks day-to-day as the days differed, be it working in the changing room, on the polo wall, kids wear etc. It also ensured a greater product knowledge having experienced all the different sizes and body types. Staff were all very friendly and easy to get along well with."
good,Busy and informational. Excellent experience working with a very diverse group of individuals. Working at Polo taught me new ways to increase my awareness of peoples needs.
good,There were days of sporadic activity season to season that allows departmental staff to work together to push sales and provide the ultimate shopping experience to clients.
good,"Ralph lauren is a good job to work part time but because of management and the fact that you cant move up, makes the job less pleasing. Every week you never know how many hours your really going to get. the job isnt hard its just that the managers there make you not want to do the work there because sometimes they dont know how to speak to the employees."
good,"hours vary"
good,"Very well focused and sales driven, emphasized by the management team. No targets, just maintaining shop floor is essential to the employer. Great benefits."
good,"Great culture for any lover of apparel and fashion or anyone fascinated in how a brand is made-up."
good,"A typical day at work required me to make sure that the floor is cleared of all rubbish, i would need to go to tills when it was busy as well as handle customer needs."
good,"A typical day for me is loading pallets and trucks and loading them up. i learned the right way to pick up boxes that are heavy, i also learned how to use a scan gun. the management was pretty fair, so were my coworkers. there really wasn't a hard part about the job"
good,"I am a fun, energetic, happy, organized, hardworking individual who loves QA software testing and project management.  I enjoy getting a project and following it through the SDLC.  I find great gratification in seeing a project to it's launch date and knowing I had a part of making that happen."
good,The staff and management at Ralph Lauren made it a great place to work. Great place to get experience with customer service and sales.
good,Flexible hours and generous discount. This is a great job to have if you're in school. Job is hard to move up. There's no room for promotion.
good,"For the most part, the managment team is good. The hours are unpredictable. So you may get great hours one week and very little the next. The coworkers are great to work with."
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,"Assist customers with merchandise and stock merchandise.  Most of the management was great.  Overall, it's a great company!"

good,I was a sales Associate. I assisted in making sales and organizing merchandise.I also created connections by engaging in great customer service.
good,Working at RL has been like and extension of fashion design graduate schools where you can earn masters degree in any specialized product category.
good,I was a sales associate for the short summer grand opening of one of their store. The people and the culture were great. I was motivated every day in helping customers. It was great learning experience in sales.
good,"Nice job for kids in high school. Needed Advancement, after working for 2 years."
good,"Great company but as any other company, there tend to be issues within...managers can be very overbearing and many are unaware of what to do and how to do the jobs of those they oversee...very frustrating for employees."
good,Buna esperienza da avere per la creazione di look e per avere una completa partecipazione nelle vendite e nella gestione dei rapportini da comunicare all'azienda.
good,At this job you will remain occupied for the entirety of your shift which is a good thing since the time goes by a lot faster than it will if you were just sitting around. It is a very upbeat but sometimes robotic place to work at. At this job i learned how to treat customers and assist with placement of mannequins. The co workers are always fun to be around and they are very supportive of the positions held in the store. The hardest part of this job for me was waking up at 6am in the morning since i was on the Floor first team. Management will push you to succeed the revenue of the store by pushing you to hand out more shopping bags to the customers.
good,There is no strict dress code. The atmosphere is very laid back. It's actually fun to help people shop.
good,"Complete opening procedures. Walk sales floor to ensure visual standards, marketing and stock levels are ready for the start of business. Team oriented staff. The hardest part of the job would be as a manager not being supported by corporate or upper management. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the benefits,"
good,"Resolving POS issues, training and developing staff, checking for incoming freight and ensuring for adequate staffing to process, payroll and HR resolution daily, facilities management and resolving warehouse constraint issues."
good,the work was easy to learn and understand the process of how things work.
good,Assisting Customers with shopping needs in addition to managing cashier duties and floor settings and sales goals.
good,I have learned how to influence people in the selection of clothing. I work as part of a team in reaching company goals. My co-workers are great to work with. The most enjoyable part of my position is helping others. My views of management is that they need to make growth opportunities more available to the over achievers like myself.
good,Rien a dire de plus mon experience dans cette entreprise restera benefique pour mon avenir apres je recherche un emploie autre car emploie plus adapter a mon experience jaimerais decouvrire autre choses
good,This company has many different job opportunities in all departments.  They have a alot of partime positions with many different time slots available.  Good for high school kids and young adults just starting out in the work world
good,This job was temporary for me so my hours weren't that great because I wasn't a long term employee. It payed me well and I got some good hours for the time being. Only thing I hated was that we couldn't listen to music while packing which made it boring.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Ralph Lauren as it enabled me too meet new people and develop new skills. However, i did have to le\ve after three months due to poor management being very Rude to the staff by being very ageist and racial to certain people. The younger people would always get picked on or told off for  no reason and this caused 13 of us to leave in under two weeks. Many people left work crying and getting underpaid. In my opinion it was one of the worst experiences of a work place."
good,Many of my coworkers were attending school at Kent State University. Everybody including the managers went above and beyond to improve the working environment. The only problem that I ran into with this company was the far commute.
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,"Overall decent work environment, first set of management was a bit hostile with each other, resulting in a toxic workplace. Second set was great and a lot was being accomplished with the company and numbers were at an all time low. Lastly, the last set of management experienced was one of strict discipline and little to no tolerance for stepping out of line. The work itself was honest and somewhat rewarding, the team of associates were great to work with and very enjoyable as well. The Job opportunity taught me a lot about a different retail environment than I was used to. The hardest part of the job was how demanding it was with availability and work load, whilst the most enjoyable part being the team of associates."
good,Great discounts on fashion clothing that is in style. Good customer service experience is aquired while meeting a wide range of individuals at a popular high fashion brand store.
good,"* managers acted as fellow employees"
good,39hr a week
good,This job was a temp job. You have times where your working alot and making good money. Other times your out of work for weeks at a time. The management was amazing they work with you.
good,"Overall Polo Ralph Lauren is good company to work for especially if you want a retail job with competitive wages and benefits; however, that comes at a price when it comes to having enough staff on hand during certain shifts to maintain the upkeep of the store and it's contents. Shoplifting/asset protection in certain locations are a real big issue, solely due to the fact that managers pull everyone from the floor from almost every department to cashier, leaving the floor wide open for shoplifting opportunities. During the holidays and peak seasonal days, I highly recommend an increased number of scheduled cashiers to ring and rotate each other out and increased number of floor coverage for every department, ESPECIALLY Kids. There are a lot of blind spots in this department due to the congestion of tight fixture placements and floor plan configurations."
good,"Very great environment. Team was great to manage. Senior Leadership worked really hard to help people develop. Store was a bit slow during downtime, but really picks up during peak hours."
good,"Polo Ralph Lauren was the worst case scenario for a retail job. The managers would micromanage constantly, and they hardly cared about your schedule outside of work."
good,working there was ok but not enjoyable. always have to work on holiday even Thanksgiving.  sometimes its feel like they forcing you or you going loosing you job if you not show up. the job there was easy but it hard to become employee or permanent there. i was working there as Temporary  for two years. i prove myself everyday and working hard above average picking performance and quality for two years but i am still not permanent there.
good,"good experience "
good,"工作環境丶薪酬和福利好"
good,Abercrombie and fitch is ok for high school students looking to break in to the retail world. Management was ok not the best. Did not approve of their old CEO but they are looking to dramatically rebrand their image.
good,i enjoyed working there in the reserve department learned how to use different type of machinairy. shipping department farely slow.
good,"Empersa donde hay una gran plantilla de la que aprender. Muy cerrados a los cambios y mejoras que se puedan proponer y escasa formación."
good,"A typical day at work involves staffs standing at different posts doing work. Some attending to customers in the front section, some making sure the items are in the right places, some in the store upstairs helping out and others on the till selling. Busy environment, but fun sometimes because you get to work with people you know and have good conversations while working."
good,"Loved the job when I first started. Recruited with the promise of career advancement. When the opportunities arose to advance, management preferred to hire outside. This was across the board in the Greensboro office. There were known occasions when management prevented switching teams and promotions. "
good,"Overall, a well respected company that is a great place to learn and grow your career."
good,"hoewel ik graag bij polo ralph lauren gewerkt heb is de werkdruk er zeer hoog voor een minimaal loon. geen goede reviews het is er zo druk dat je de winkel niet opgeruimd krijgt. te weinig personeel."
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,"Folding clothes in a correct manner, Long hours of receptiveness,"
good,"make sure customers get their orders in a timely manner. I have learned to be a team player and to learn multiple positions in the company. I have learned management skills and learned to deal with different personalities. The company takes pride in its name and culture. The hardest part of the is playing catch up from the previous shift, just so the items can make it out on time. To know that my team is working together to get the job done."
good,Can be stressful when the lines get long and can be understaffed. Know your stuff and can be promoted easily. I was promoted to a supervisor within 6 months of being with the company. Customers can be terrible but if you partner with other managers should be ok to come up with solutions or support eachother. At the orange location Managers can be inconsistent on rules but messages eventually get across. Manager meetings are only the main managers so as a supervisor you have to keep guessing until you ask or they tell you. Theres lots of kids in college working there so there are lots of callouts and excuses.
good,Pretty fun depending on the busy days did get stressful at times. Overall a nice working experience. I learned a lot of guest service skills and how to deal with guests in stressful situations
good,Manager is very nice and patient with workers. They train you right but right now hours are very limited. The pay is only 8.00 starting out but each month you get a quarter raise. Health insurance is offered but have to accept it within 30 days of employment.
good,"Working at Ralph Lauren in Aspen, CO was somewhat difficult for me as the customers were already previous clients to those whom had been working there longer than I had. I had a tough time keeping up with the high end side of the store as I was much younger than the other employees making it so the customers seemed to appeal to them more. I was able to overcome this by being personable and communicating to the customers that while yes, I was young, I was able to still give them honest feedback on their choices and help them through the Ralph Lauren shopping experience."
good,Ralph Lauren was a very productive good place to work at when they have work. It's just sometime they don't have work and they lay you off that's why I left.
good,"The hours was good, just didn't like tha drive back and forth, nice people to work with, alot of walking and standing, but u get the hang of it, fun, yes."
good,Great place to meet people from all over the world. Could learn a lot from the customers about the culture they come from. Co workers are great.
good,I worked stock here and didn't really see much of the sales floor except for merchandising. I learned basic business practices here and how to keep a stock room well organized. Management basically kept to themselves here and did little to help just gave orders and sat in the back. My co-workers were hard working and did their jobs great. Hardest part of this job was getting or keeping my hours as there were too many people working here.
good,"I enjoy my day to day work ""The trust my manager and team have in me, and the wide variety of technology I get to be exposed to. I also like how involved upper management is in projects at a technical level instead of just at a higher-level, more hands-off level."""
good,Responsible for the increase in cliental and supporting with the increase of sells and up-selling
good,Great place to be.
good,"The company mainly concentrated on first impressions. Natural colored hair, tucked polo shirts into khaki colored pants, greeting each and every customer with a smile and a quick explanation of whats in each room. Interview process was quite long and was in a group. The hardest part of the job was interacting with tourists and customers with disabilities such as being deaf."
good, Customer Service
good,"Well at this time, there was too many people working and I really didn't get to do much.It was the same thing every time, folding the same shirt."
good,"not enough work hours, the management team seemed to change about every month. Not enough work hours given when you do not have an open availability. that was really the only thing that i dealt with at ralph lauren"
good,"A nice place to work with good work/life balance. Benefits are nothing special, and compensation is on the low end. Job security is good, advancement is possible but often a possibility. Lacking in training."
good,At Polo Ralph Lauren I had to work with big team in order to meet the stores sales standards on everyday basis. The team and I had to maintain the store and ficilities clean. I worked in a fast paced environment competiing for the highest sales value.
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,"Good place to work, good management, was some favoriting going on there, Flexible hours, easy management to contact and talk to, great coworkers, keeps you busy."
good,I didn't mind this company. I sought advancement for a long time but they never gave me the opportunity. I asked for a raise to match what the new hires were getting and was denied. The management were a delight and so were my co-workers but it was a temporary kind of gig. I would have never gotten a career out of it.
good,"Was just a job wasn’t able to provide for myself "
good,"I was able to learn a lot here regarding customer service and handling cash. Even as a regular employee I was able to do Supervisor duties that helped me grow as an individual. Management was not good, not everyone was treated equally and communication between management and employees was not great. The most enjoyable part of the job was having employees as friends."
good,It's very hard to get the scheduled hours when you are taking classes. Management does not work with your class schedule or take into consideration the days you can and cannot work.
good,"Busy, always room for suggestions, management was great, the workplace culture was good, hardest part of my positions were not enough time in a day to complete everything I needed to do, hence need to split my workload with two other people would have been good, most enjoyable part was the travel to other locations meeting new people and learning different ways to do my job."
good,It got the bills paid nothing special about this job. I worked overnight opening the boxes that came in for that night. I set the pace for the rest of the employees that I worked with.
good,"Great Place to work, as long as you like stressful situations. Management expects you to work at a moments notice, even if you reached the end of your nine am to six pm shift.  It is expected that you be willing to work Saturdays and Sundays if you are needed. Without any concern for your health or well being. Not much of a work-life balance. Work expectations are unreasonable, with hardly a chance to catch a break."
good,working there was alright. it was not the best experience. Working there was not a permanent thing. it was an ok job for the summer.
good,Political environment in certain departments.  Good workers- some awful managers.
good,"Maintained constant presence on sales floor to address customer needs. Approach browsing customers and initiate conversations to determine buying preferences. Multitasked from being a sales associate, to being a cashier, and working with stock. Assisted in clothing display, inventory, and pricing. Developed strong working relationship with co-workers and managers."
good,"good work ambience, boring job, not ;any hours, shop discounts"
good,"the job itself was exciting but there wasn't much opportunity to grow."
good,Not much room for advancement but the discounts were really nice.  It's your average retail job. My team was great and fun just wish the pay was a little more at the time.
good,"A typical day as a sales associate at Polo Ralph Lauren begins with announcing you are on the floor and ready to begin working. A manager then assigns you a zone to focus on and stay in to greet customers as they come by and assist them if you can, or simply facing product in your area. During this time a manager may come over and ask you to work on a project, update you on current sales, or simply talk with you based on how much traffic is on the store."
good,Overall as a first job it was very good. I got to learn the basics of having a job and I'm thankful that it was at Ralph Lauren. It was a learning experience.
good,"Contact met klanten"
good,"I enjoyed working with the management. The longer I worked there, however, the more strict the rules became. The hardest part of the job was getting prepared for it, like choosing the right and appropriate outfit. The best part of the job was the environment, the coworkers, and the enjoyment of helping others. While working here, I had no life...I always worked on weekends unless I wasn't scheduled at all that week. I didn't like that the schedules were at random every week especially since I knew I had to work almost every weekend, just didn't know what times."
good,"It’s a great company to work for if you’re starting out because you’ll learn business skills for future job opportunities. Management is continually making decisions to restructure departments and frequently you will have a new manager with no comprehension of your work. The company seems to care more about the creative parts instead of tactical business strategies. Unless you’re connected to the family, you will have to wait years after hard work for career advancement or a salary you deserve. In my 6 years, there were multiple rounds of layoffs for 5 of the 6 years and more to come in the future."
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,If a work life balance is not important to you then I highly recommend working here. You barely get any days off and its very hard to change your work availability.
good,"RL is and has been going through many internal changes - this is widely known to those inside and outside of the fashion industry. I was hired as a temp, but the position was ultimately dissolved shortly there after."
good,Working at Polo Ralph Lauren was a great experience for myself. I learned valuable real world work experience and customer service skills on top of the customer service skills I had going into the job.
good,"Great co workers, no management though. Very flexible hours and plenty of opportunity’s to learn new skills. Good benefits and rewards for hard work. Good discounts to other Ralph Lauren stores other than outlets."
good,"You learn a lot not just how to behave in your work environment but on your daily basis too , need to know how to work with a sense of urgency.  Management is balanced we have some good managers and others are not as good."
good,"learned a lot about the retail , whats important for the customers and what specific items they are after. the work place consisted of mostly hard working people who took initiatives to  solve problems ."
good,Great place to work overall.  Most of the people that work there are willing to help you and are extremely friendly.  This job allowed me the opportunity to add additional skills to my resume such and email and chat services.
good,"I enjoy my job very much, most of the time, however we are at an awkward stage at the moment from where they have over hired workers, they are bringing in everybody all at once, and there is barely enough work for everybody. You are lucky to get in 20 hours a week."
good,"I enjoyed my time there but at some point with no advancement in position or salary you have to make choices. I will def recommend working there , a lil slow but def worth it"
good,"necesidad de dinamismo y rapidez, mucho volumen de exigencia y ventas, polivalencia, cnocimiento d todos los procesos de tienda"
good,"Polo was a good place to work, it taught me great customer service skills and responsibility being my first job.Polo was a good place to work"
good,"A typical day at work would be to check my computer for any orders from the advertising team."
good,This Job is all about customer servicing. i learned how to deal with many types of people from different cultures. i always liked the people i was working with. the hardest part of the job was the shipment part when sales associates had to stay late nights to finish unpacking the shipment.
good,"Working at Ralph Lauren, you need to have the mind set that you will be working long hours. many times I felt my hard work wasn't being recognized properly."
good,"A typical day at work, check in, read the status of the store as sales is concerned, be informed about the personal goal of the day, make sure about the new arrival o collection."
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo relación compañeros y jefes.
good,My experience at Ralph Lauren has been exciting and stimulating.  The situational challenges are varied.  The people are motivated and very creative.  No complaints.
good,"The company is in a transition period.  Many ppl from outside of the company keep getting hired in high rolls, which just causes confusion, and prevents the seasoned employees from advancing."
good,"•	Handled cash desk to help customers checkout."
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,It’s a fun workplace for someone who’s in high school. It’s a lot of young people which makes it fun. Learning about new things was also fun and management were very helpful
good,"Early morning, mid day, and evening shifts available. No shift differential for over night shift. You have to work all holidays and Black Friday. Working thru out the night for Black Friday without pay difference."
good,Fun place to work if your in school and dont really need that much money. if your an adult looking for a job to pay bills unless you get hired as full time this is NOT the place. hours are inconsistent depending on sale and pay is very low.
good,"Job was easy , people were nice for the most part , and the fellow employees were the best part. I learned a lot about sales and the procedure of how sales works from the back of house to the front of house as well as upper management al the lway down to employee. Management was in my opinion the worst part of the job experience but the job culture was one of my favorites to date. The hardest part of the job was trying not to spend your paycheck on the clothes with the incredible discount they used to give you. The most enjoyable part of the job was the culture , employees, and the clothes."
good,"the overall goal of the day was to give the customers a great experience shopping and to make the quota every day."
good,I had fun and enjoyed working in the stockroom at New Bond Street. Great team and great people. I can’t really say much that’s bad about Ralph Lauren.
good,"Stocked clothing items, make sure store and fitting rooms were clean and tidy. Rang customers at the end of their shopping experience. Left because of problematic scheduling issues."
good,"The one perk to this job is that there is always something to do, but the downside is the pay is not very good. The Shop is always busy and you will have to work quickly to help customers in a timely manner."
good,I loved working with the brand and product.  The store was a million dollar build and was absolutely gorgeous.  The staff and management were challenging.
good,Ralph Lauren is a well-known designer label.  I was satisfactory to my work and contribution.
good,Assisted in helping customers choose their outfits fashionably. Worked alongside diverse team. However did not receive much training as I know was offered.
good,You get many people that are traveling. I learned to be patient with customers who are not familiar as the locals and guide them by giving full customer service. Store has a lot of theft activity.
good,It was a good first job but for the amount of effort I would put in to helping the company out I don't think I ever got praised or rewarded for doing so. I left because I felt like I wasn't being treated fairly and not getting paid enough.
good,Good place to start to gain experience. Always busy so it's hard to keep up. But overall nice place to have a pt job. They don't have that many ft available though.
good,Incredible place to work until 2015. Learning was constant throughout and was exciting to go to work daily. Inspiring to see the energy and spirit of the teams. New leadership came in and turned the company on its head. The environment on all floors had become toxic.
good,"Its and alright place if you don't mind a lot of walking, bending, and lifting items. Shipping them is fairly easy since everything has its own style of box, make sure the box is right and tape it label it and push it down the chute."
good,"was on the floor to sell the merchandise, was also in the back doing the fitting room, high energy environment always busy, during holidays it gets intense but fun"
good,"Love my work , love to create and give ideas and solutions to customers."
good,"This is truly one of the most amazing brands to work for as a proud member of the Ralph Lauren family I ca honestly say it has been one of the better experience I have had in retail. I enjoy the people I work with, the brand and most of all the iconic man behind it all."
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,Proud to associate with the company.Its a great learning experience for me in all the aspects.Learned how to handle professional and personal life.
good,"A day working at Ralph Lauren is a perfect combination of fun and productivity. I learned how to improve my customer service to a higher standard. For the most part, the co-workers all had a good dynamic. The hardest part of the job was being the greeter because they don't give you as much responsibilities so one does begin to feel stagnant and the most enjoyable part of the job was keeping busy!"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting the clients and          assisting the Sales Executives.The management gives direction well. My co-workers are very competitive. The hardest part of the job is heavy work load expected of you in the short time frame.
good,"Learn how sort out the stocks"
good,"I was interested in retail jobs, its not that difficult to learn an also i had work experience in being neat and making sure that my work always comes out perfect the hardest part of the job to me was standing in the welcome zone an keeping your eyes on everyone that enter and exit.The easy part was making sure your costumers were satisfied and happy."
good,You have to go through a temp service so there is no guaranteed work unless you are a full-time associate.
good,Work place is very fun and energetic with great co-worker/management relationships but very little professionalism from all parties.
good,Duties include assisting customers with purchases on the sales floor while maintaining stock and replenishing merchandise. I also do price checks and complete merchandise transactions for customers. I also assist in closing the registers and counting the drawers at the end of the night in the cash office.
good,"people are amazing pay is awful"
good,"- Greet and assist customers while maintaining store presence"
good,Working at this company has helped me to use my self motivation to utilize the tools that are available to learn different things and to improve on the potential and skills that i brought to the company. It taught me more so that I have to take the initiative in my own development.
good,"incredible experience, one of the most high politics environments, extremely quick paced, very high barriers to entry, social battlefield, military style hierarchy, very cool personalities and the sharpest dressers on the planet, style that blows you away. Everyone is refined, sophisticated, and has presence."
good,Was confusing at times due to the foreign visitors the store got.
good,Customer service from moment of entry to end of sale.  Assist whenever possible to make experience one to remember and insure customer returning happy.
good,"I was hired as a seasonal employee during one of the busiest time frames within the company; semi and private sales. A typical day during this time would consist of clocking in at 7:55, going to my system to log in and set everything up and receiving my first call at 8:00 am. After receiving my first call, the calls would be constant for the next 2 1/2 hours. My coworkers would talk around me as I tried to stay focused and handle my high volume of calls. The managment team was efficient and would try to be there when needed but sometimes I was left to fend for myself with escalated situations. The most difficult thing to endure while working this job was the strict breaks and lunch schedule with no time to divert from that, as you were graded accordingly. The most enjoyable thing about this position was the culture. The company really made sure you felt welcomed and loved with appreciation lunches, discount programs, and shift swaps. "
good,"Poste occupé durant un mois."
good,"É uma empresa com um certo estatuto e clientela o que traz certas responsabilidades como trabalhador, no entanto o salário é o mesmo que qualquer loja."
good,"I enjoyed working here, the people were friendly, the responsibilities were appropriate and the product was high quality. The pay was reasonable for the work."
good,"You spend 95% of the day on your feet. The day is usually busy, with the occasional down time. Theft is massive. Be prepared. Thieves can be aggressive. Customers are friendly. Pay isn't terrible for what you do. You do get a discount, and the interview process was quick. If there is a good manager, this is a fun job."
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,un bonne esprit de groupe j'ai appris a travailler en équipe
good,My focus as a Sales Associate for Ralph Lauren was to help guests find anything they need and provide my expertise on product knowledge. As well as tend the cash register.
good,"overall it was great experience working for such an established company. I've learned a lot and met great people that I remain friends with. It was diverse, competitive, fast paced but still a good wok environment."
good,This is a great resource for the user and the provider of its website . I would recommend to others daily . Great tools & servce . Second time using the website.
good,"everyone is friendly which I like, management actually care for their associates. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers out with whatever it is they may need. For example, finding them the right size."
good,This plave is good for older people or people with okder children. Make sure your time is appreciated and your physucally able to perform the job task.
good,"The work/life balance was never in my favor.  I held financial forecast conference calls with New York - while on my honeymoon."
good,"Very poor management and bad behavior directed at employees"
good,I worked here for a decent amount of time but watched as nearly 40 employees turned over at a store that only employs around 10 people at a time. The management was did not communicate well and showed favoritism.
good,The store has become more of a team than just people who work together. The management team really pushes you to do your best and make sure that the customers are always taken care of.
good,"The workplace is a good environment if you do your work and not mess around. Just like any other job, do your work well, your company as well as you will benefit from the work and time you put in. If you are courteous to people, they will return the kindness and it's a win win situation when you can do your part as a worker as well as fulfilling job requirements."
good,I worked with RL for 12 years.  This company has high standards for their employees and it shows in the talent that they hire.  The company culture is fast paced and competitive.
good,"Ralph Lauren was an enjoyable place to work. The store i worked in was located in Bicester Village, it was a good store to work for as a manager. They offered a good salary but wanted a lot from those busy trade periods in Bicester Village when the store was very under staffed. The basic wage for those who aren't on a mangement level wasn't competitive for Bicester Village and often people would work for Ralph Lauren to get into the village and then leave for a better offer elsewhere. As a manager you are trust to run the store but you aren't given much opinion on how to improve sales or put ideas into practice, this was one of the worst things about working here as I have proved in past roles that i'm very capable of this."
good,Very good company to work for and great people to work under. Even though there was little progression within the role it was a pleasure to work for such a high end retail company.
good,"My first sales job ever.  Loved the culture and of course the clothes.  I developed my interpersonal skills, presentation and consumer personality types working at Ralph Lauren.  They require you to take sales training classes before you are allowed to sell their product."
good,The main reason I left Ralph Lauren was because it was too far of a drive and I know the pay I was receiving was not worth it. It was a nice work environment but for me personally I could go no further.
good,Solid company with consistent quality merchandise and exemplary store standards. Excellent employee benefits. Demanding but a rewarding place to work.
good,good company with committed employees. going through restructure creating unstable environment. work culture is basic corporate America. enjoyed the legacy associated with the brand name.
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,very productive place and a lot of walking when you work in the warehouse picking orders.I enjoyed my job on the quality line the most doing quality inspections of the orders.
good,"Polo factory outlet is a work place were every employee as to know how to do it all, not much of a training but you learn in the process , love the different cultures and ages working in the company."
good,working here was really fun and challenging because we would always try and change things up to see if we can get things done faster and right! the back of house team was a great family too!
good,"Fun workplace if you set your mind to it, can be stressful on busy days but can also be extremely slow and relaxed on days where there aren’t many customers."
good,"Days are full of pulling and putting out ISOS, learning about customers and building relationships. Every manager is uniquely talented and nice to work with."
good,"Working in a central location where international tourists visit was a great experience. It was really a pleasure getting to know people from around the world. Overall, working for Ralph is okay. The starting pay is not that great, but the staff is very friendly and management is willing to work with you to improve your skill set.  However, this is not a job where many people advance in. It can be incredibly boring and unmotivating to work there. There is nothing special or miraculous about working here. I do not regret my time working here, but I would not necessarily want to work there again. Those days are gone, and I am on to better things. If you are someone who does not mind retail and wants to excel in it, then Ralph is a great company to work for."
good,a typical day at Polo Ralph Lauren I would go in find out what our sales goal is for the day and I would walk around the store and sell customers some clothes but if it isn't that busy then I would have to just walk around the store and make sure everything is neat
good,"Great place to work, very friendly and welcoming. All about team work, not only helping customers but also helping each other out to be a successful workplace."
good,A typical day has a steady pace. At times the facility I work at is slow paced due to low order volume. Have a high turnover rate for temporary associates due to low pay and inconsistent training. Very difficult to move up but they do try to train associates in some basic computer skills.
good,The people were great the commute was too far for me. They  were willing to accommodate my schedule for school as well by letting me work different shifts.
good,"Nice place to work however if you didn't get peoples information, whether the customer wanted to give it or not, the managers made a fuss about it. Other then that it was a nice place to work"
good,very productive job. quick paced job. the benefits are good only for full-time people. management skills are good. you'll have to be fast doing packing and hour lunches
good,"Great environment to work when wanting to gain retail experiences. Potential moving up in this field, friendly workers. High pace job, could require for you to do more then one potions. "
good,"Very long hours, Not a lot of support staff. High stakes to produce large quantites for inspiration. Reasonable salary but very little personal time without a choice."
good,The atmosphere was very fun and relaxed even at our busiest times. The managers were extremely respectful and responsible. I enjoyed working with my employees and the customers.
good,Move out of town but it was a good place for career advancement unfortunately I wasn’t able to stay since I had to move out of town to chase my dreams and get better
good,managers has there ups and downs but are very friendly once your on there good side. they teach you well with how to customer service and how to speak confidently
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,"was my first job in sales, was not bad. i enjoyed it. managers were very nice. was not a hard job. had to try in sale merchandise to customers. Help customers find an item they are looking for."
good,The store is smaller in size with an inventory that is manageable to learn and assist customers. The management isn't very flexible and have a rigid work place culture.
good,"Working at Ralph Lauren I had a good time while I was able to learn to deal with different kinds of people. the work environment was stressful at times, but with all of the team work, the job was easy."
good,It is almost always busy which makes it great. It is a store customers love to come to and always a joy to be around them. The employee discounts are great and so are the products. Management is fun to be around and work with you as opposed to just telling you what to do.
good,"I enjoyed working here the employees and staff were very nice and everyone got along well."
good,"Poor Management"
good,Learned much about the brand and it's Americana heritage.  Felt that marketing the brand was one of the most important roles I had even though I was responsible for wholesale.
good,Daily responsibilities range from markdowns to floorset moves. Any given day could be a day for a corporate visit. Always expected to  stay on toes and maintain high standards.
good,Polo Ralph Lauren had the best customer service in the super-mall in my opinion. A typical day consisted of talking to a lot of awesome people and helping them find the look they were going for. Management was friendly and fun and helped you develop your sales and communication skills if you were willing to be teachable.
good,"Ralph Lauren continues to be a brand with a rich heritage and quality product! Several divisions of the company display strong teamwork, and a sincere respect for each other."
good,"Working at Ralph Lauren is cool, the staff is friendly and very cool to work with. Management is very understanding with your personal life. It's a great experience."
good,"Ralph Lauren is a good place to work, but IT and the organization is in a state of re-org and infrastructure is currently being outsourced. Hopefully they can re-invent and improve on current structure."
good,I worked here part time. It was a laid back environment and easy to learn to do. The manager was good to the employees. The hardest part was staying occupied because the store was in a rural town with small amounts of traffic. A good starting point.
good,The managers were always on different agendas. They would never work together to solve a problem they would just see something they thought was the problem and focus on that but wouldn't take any of the other managers into consideration.
good,"Polo Ralph Lauren in Lake George, NY is a great place to be a sales associate. The customers, a lot of the time, are foreign, as Lake George is known for tourists. Polo is a higher end clothing retail store."
good,"A good place to work. Competitive salary, good benefits. And ample time off for vacations. Also good work environment."
good,"Ralph Lauren has been fighting to regain its place in a very challenging retail climate over the past 3 years. Unfortunately, morale tends to be low as uncertainty continues and leadership evolves. Overall, the employees still have great respect for the brand and are committed to improving the company's bottom line, but lack of internal promotion and the climate of uncertainty has caused many to leave."
good,"The Request Management/Service Delivery team I worked with was an excellent group of people to work with. We collaborated on just about everything.  No documentation our process changes were made without the entire teams approval. We had a few management and/or corporate restructuring that took place, but in spite of that projects were normally completed on time."
good,Lots of room for growth from within. Great environment where an employee can feel comfortable. Fast paced workplace especially during holidays and weekends.
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,"Till training amongst other training provided"
good,"Working mostly evenings I had a great experience with POLO. My main boss was prior Navy and had great leadership skills. Again in the retail field, I dealt with people of all backgrounds, being that it was in an outlet mall in a tourist destination. Meeting new people was a great perk of the job. Which is why all of my previous jobs have to deal with customer service in one way or another."
good,"- workplace culture is that if you work hard, you will advance and be successful within the company. "
good,"Any retain job is going to be stressful. Ralph Lauren was stressful, but it was still a good experience. There is always something to do, so you are never bored. But it is a lot of stress."
good,"Spoke with customers to find their needs so that I could assist them in finding them a product worth their while"
good,"few stores can compare to the experience at this store"
good,Polo was a great place to work very comprehensive supervisors. The people that work around you are fun and easy going to work with. Very good first experience in retail.
good,the vibe in this place is awesome . If you are in need of a place with niv=ce clothes a good discount and part time hours . here you go
good,"Folding clothes,costumer service,become a better greeter,my co workers very friendly,the hardest part was to do the sales goal every single day,get the goal and employees get 30% discount."
good,"With new leadership, the company is currently going through a major reorg, so the atmosphere can be tense at times.  Overall, strong company to work for."
good,Worked for the company during its earliest stages of development. The management team is exceptionally talented and striving to grow the company to be a leader in the marketplace.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers and just meeting new people in general."
good,I liked working at this company it was a misunderstanding with co-workers who fail due to lack of training and team player skills and lastly personality.
good,Great Place to work.  Was located in a primetime mall so we ALWAYS had heavy traffic especially during the hustle and bustle of holiday season.  Overall Great place to work.
good,A job to get me through college and it was quite busy so I was always doing something at all times. I crafted a great customer service voice by speaking to so many guests
good,Polo was a great company to work for as they realized the long crazy hours and compensated accordingly.  There were great perks like Polo renting out Rye Play land for the employees.
good,"responsibilities included upselling, retail work, folding clothes, distributing items throughout the store, intake of shipping, retail knowledge, maintaining area, providing customer service, upkeep of self-attire, visual awareness for shoplifters."
good,Good work environment with good benefits and employee perks. Warehouse is comfortable all year. There are a lot of great people there.
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting people from different parts of the world that came to Woodbury Commons to shop. Ive met people from India, Saudi Arabia, Africa, and more places while working there and I was able to talk to them about their country and why they went there out of all places to shop."
good,"I like working at ralph Lauren polo, however the position did not last very long due to it being a temporary position for the holidays."
good,I learned a lot working there. I was able to really connect with my management team and understood what they needed from me.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was interaction with the customers advising them on other merchandise that would compliment their collection."
good,"I interacted and met many new people. I learned about Polo's specific style, pricing , and customer service . A typical day at work was filled with networking, selling, and learning more about this world class brand."
good,My favorite designer hands down is Ralph Lauren so working for them was my pleasure. I would highly recommend them for anyone looking for seasonal employment.
good,"One must always be on their toes working for Ralph Lauren. Customers are constantly coming and going so one must assist customers as much as possible while maintaining daily duties such as upkeep of the store, inventory and replenishing product. The management team does a great job creating a healthy and happy working environment."
good,"Great friendships, great opportunity to learn and grow. The only con is the pay. Supervisors should be paid more for the workload."
good,"The facility is a high-volume location, I and one other associate are capable of opening the store alone. I take the tasks of three employees and when received support, I delegate others to cover departments that need to be serviced."
good,"Great place to work, friendly staff. Most positions are part time."
good,This job was very calm and a fun environment. The work wasn't to hard and was very enjoyable for me. My team members were very helpful and fun as well.
good,"I typical day at Ralph Lauren would be to Assure that all APP associates have arrived in a timely manner. Continue to work on any investigations that I haven't finished. Make sure all floor counts have been completed. Partner with our fine Jewelry department on any out going or incoming Jewelry. I worked with the operations manager on a day to day basis ensuring that the store is up to code. On certain occasions I would do meeting and inform associates on how to protect the brand, deter clients from stealing and how to detect any suspicious behaviors. Also I assisted with events that took place at our store and work very closely with all management in all departments."
good,This is the place for you if you are looking to working with people from different countries and you want look part of the Ralph Lauren brand
good,I loved every second of woring here. The store was always busy and there was always something to do. Customers were hectic but staff handled all situations flawlessly.
good,"A typical day at work entails completing certain tasks, such as placing the correct amount of units onto the floor and arranging them so that they are aesthetically pleasing to management and the customers. However, the most important thing is customer service. While there, I learned how to utilize time efficiently in order to complete certain tasks by a desired deadline. Management varied drastically during my time with the company, but the best managers were the ones who physically and mentally contributed to the productivity of the store, not just giving orders while standing over your shoulder. Co-workers of mine have been mostly positive to work with, but some require some patience or guidance, especially when it comes to working together in a timely manner to recover a store before our allotted time has expired. The hardest part of the job was to remain positive and energetic after being insulted and challenged by customers, and overworked by management. However, the most enjoyable part of the job was forming relationships with coworkers and management, and being appreciated by customers who were willing to accept our assistance."
good,You can find a number of entry level positions here and it's a great place to get started with a career in the fashion industry
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,"95% You are in store and the rest of the time you are at your home office on conference calls and evaluating your business.The management is very structured, you always have someone to report to."
good,"Could not have loved my actual job more. I interviewed and hired over 110 associates and loved the whole process from application to training. A typical day consisted of managing the sales floor 5 to 6 hours out of the 8 that I was scheduled. The other  2 to 3 were spent on human resources. All staff required documents signed, dated, and in folders which were then sent to corporate. A large part of my job was composing a schedule for 40 associates in non-seasonal times and up to 110 during the holiday season. I learned how to listen more to better our team moral and make it an overall positive work place. Most of my time overall was spent at the store leaving little personal growth. I would never erase the experience and am thankful that I was able to meet so many different and amazing people."
good,I like the pay and the work load but i just wasn't able to balance going to school with it
good,"I was a sales floor representative and a cashier. I started work on black Friday so of course my first couple of days were insane, but the management was very understanding and helped everyone out a lot. It was a fun environment."
good,"At Polo Ralph Lauren I first started off in sales, and began doing floor sets and store changes. I primarily work the floor sets which involve bring new merchandise on the floor, following the plan-o-gram we receive and laying the merchandise out correctly. Problems do arise where we do not have the correct merchandise featured on the plan-o-gram so improvising and making something look great regardless of the lack in merchandise is key. I love being able to engage in something that is time consuming, and seeing the end result. It also gives me a bit of a creative outlet when improvising with gondolas, shelving,  or face out displays. I have a great team of employees that I work with- the merchandiser of the store being extremely patient and offering me so much of the knowledge that I have today. I would say top two most enjoyable parts of my job are seeing a customer completely satisfied and knowing that you were the cause, and seeing the beginning and end views of a floor set/remodel that you thought would be impossible and seeing how the effort you put in created something great."
good,"A typical day at work began with stocking the floor before the store opened; and afterwards, assisting with sales."
good,Managed 25 person sales team.  Continual mentoring and managing growth of team.  Supervised flow of inventory to the floor. Managed all customer service issues in a luxury store environment.
good,I was the manager on Ralph Lauren menswear which involved effective selling skills and customer service skills. I was responsible of part-time sales advisers whom I must encourage to sell store cards as well as the products. I was consistently announced as the best store card opener and always high on previous years figures on the products that I was selling. I was opening 60 store cards per month when the target was only 4.
good,"Not a lot of progress, needed further education or room to grow"
good,"Responsibilities:"
good,"Ralph Lauren is a great company to work for. My time there was good, no complaints really. Love his fashions, great environment, management was great. I worked as an associate and while I did not advance to anything other than a sales associate/cashier (I don't recall ever given the opportunity), it was pretty good. The hours where not too bad, just your average 8 to 9-hour shifts. I did at one point go from full-time to part-time due to having another full-time job elsewhere but it wasn't too bad. My co-workers at my time of service were good, no complaints about either of them really. This job was pretty much repetitive everyday when it came to the work, but what made it enjoyable was the beautiful fashion of this great designer, seeing what new lovely things came in shipment. With all that being said, nothing really hard about this job as I can recall, pretty simple."
good,it was only a seasonal job. they co workers were very nice and i made some friends but retail life is just not the job for me.
good,A lot of experience gained in the Wholesale sector and ready to move into sales from sales support.
good,"Hard work, had to make sure the customers were always happy.Very respectful work place teamwork"
good,"- Work closely with management to create and enhance company presentations "
good,"Good company, nice staff. Enjoyed working with all of the co workers"
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,"Good place to work , nice co-workers and goods management."
good,"I have been at Ralph Lauren since August 2013, it is a nice place to work and a great retail location.  However over the holiday's seasonal workers were over hired in turn reducing hours for regular workers.  We are now in January and I have yet to get a full normal 20 hour work, I have worked one day a week for the last two weeks, not a very good income for a part timer trying to support a four year old child."
good,its a good company but even though i work hard always there really wasnt a place to move up and progress..
good,A typical day at work involved me having conversations with guests by getting to know them on a personal level and asking open-ended questions to drive sales and also suggest items to them to help build their basket. Very friendly co-workers and management. A very fast paced environment due to the large amount of traffic on a day to day basis. My most enjoyable part working at Ralph Lauren was getting to know people from different countries and suggesting different styles that they ended up liking a lot!
good,Enjoyed working the stock room. Learned alot about the aspects of stocking and inventory. worked in-store and the warehouse.
good,a corporate company that feels more intimate than would be expected
good,"Great place to work, nice clean environment, awesome co workers and managers, very specific with your work perfromance in how you fold, clean, and speak to customers. This company has very high standards."
good,"Not really bad, not really great.  People are nice, but it's a large, corporate machine."
good,I worked here during highschool. They were flexible with my hours and friendly.
good,Loved working here. Awesome bosses. Great co-workers. not very demanding. Friendly environment.
good,Ralph Lauren is a lifestyle driven company with a focus on fabrications and styling in an all American feel. Highly visually oriented to merchandise to tell a story behind each line as well as wardrobing the employees to sell a lifestyle.
good,"Interacting with new customers each day and helping with what they need. Calling stockroom to see if any of the customers items were in there. I learned to maintain customers privacy in changing rooms, and also to help the customer as much as possible. I kept the management happy by doing what was asked of me, and didn't disobey them. I managed to get on well with the co-workers, as it keeps everyone happy and makes work better. The hardest part of the job were the hours of which you had to stand on your feet with no rest. The most enjoyable part of the job was chatting to new customers and managing to give them what they want."
good,Great Company. A typical day would consist of answering 80 calls and ensuring a Legendary Experience. 
good,Great product in an ok environment. Some days were very unproductive and management was unreliable at times.
good,It is a typical retail job with greeting customers and such. but got boring folding clothes for 8 hrs a day.
good,"I was a head cashier at Polo Ralph Lauren, I helped make sure that the store was nice and neat. Try to provided excellent customer service to the customers. "
good,"Hospitality skills were improved by constant customer interaction. Attention to detail to keep ""floor"" standards high. Multitasking through customer service, standards, register, and receiving store calls."
good,"Overall I liked the job, but the only thing that I didn't like was the pay and it was temporary."
good,"Beautiful job. Loved the benefits, loved the clothes. Really enjoyed going to work to the different work days. Dynamic being that it was in an outlet."
good,Good environment to work in. Fast paced. Fashion forward place.
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,"Went in right away after clocking in you have a meeting talk about the plan and goal for the day and what you plan to do to help, I learned how to approach customers and sell. Management was their to help and teach and coworkers were their to assist. Hardest part was cdc and most enjoyable would have to be meeting new people"
good,Working with staff and giving best in class customer service
good,"Provide a comfortable atmosphere for the customer. Make sure they are well taken care of. I've learned a number a skills at this job, most importantly though how to cater to the specific needs of each and every customer. The management team could be better when it comes to setting the example for employees. Co-workers are great no complaints here. The hardest part of the job for me is keeping my energy above average. The most enjoyable part of the job is my interaction with customers."
good,"I greet customers who walk into the store, if im working the register that day i would ring there things up and check them out, or sometimes i refill the sales floor with new product. I have learned that you need to have great people skills in this type of enviroment. It really has been helpful to me."
good,I have the chance to interact with the general public on a daily basis.
good,Polo is the perfect first job out of high school. It will give great skills and habits to carry over to something better. I always think of it as a training ground for someone trying to go far in retail.
good,"It is a nice place to work.   It was fun and productive every day.  My forte is working with the customers.  Ralph Lauren saw that and allowed me to be the door greeter most of the time, but I did everything a Sales Associate was assigned  to do.  I worked in the ladies dressing room and on the floor.  I would love to work for them again or in a similar atmosphere.   My supervisors were always there for me, if I had any questions.  The employees all worked as one giant team."
good,Good company to learn the business however they need to promote earlier than 3 years. It will keep their employees longer and have them looking less at other companies.
good,En tant que vendeuse ayant travailler pendant 6 ans chez ralph lauren(enseigne franchisee) j’ai juste adorer mon travail  dans cette marque au sein de l’aeroport de geneve et qui est malheureusement fermer .
good,"A typical day at work would be speaking with the sales managers first, who would outline the days sales needed for this shop location. We would then ensure the shop was clean and tidy as at the night before and open our doors."
good,"I really enjoy working at Ralph Lauren. The company has great fashion, rules and people. I definitely love the clothing, the clientele is also manageable to work with. The manager is professional and helpful."
good,"Great atmosphere, I enjoyed meeting people from all walks of life and different countries.  Excellent benefits as well as a great discount. I didn’t see much room for advancement."
good,"A typical day at work always started from a brief either if you worked day shifts or night when needed. That was my first employment in United Kingdom so I am very great full for Ralph Lauren in Cheshire Oaks has given me. I believe that I never let them down with my work ethic and standards that I brought with me to this store. I have learned english language and I have broke any restrictions that I thought I have with communication, that was never an issue. They have believed in me since day one, till my last day. Unfortunately it was quite far from the place I lived and I couldn't make it anymore travelling with buses that often ran out of schedule. Management were very friendly and helpful. The best part of it, was definitely THE PEOPLE from every corner of the World that come and worked with us, or just visit. Different cultures all over the place."
good,Typical day involved taking tickets for support desk and answering phone calls to support administrative users and retail level customers. Hardest part of the  job was the 12 hour shifts.
good,"I believe it would be beneficial to all new employees (in all departments) if there were more training."
good,"Hectic, Corporate driven"
good,"Need to know how to manage your time and work flow"
good,"Working at Ralph Lauren was a great learning experience for me. Not only did it teach me how to do a job it taught me many life lessons,  such as being able to communicate with others."
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,"Great company , Local management is on the decline and stability is in question . The company culture overall is great and they treat employees very well ."
good,"They provide flexible hours, fair work conditions and pay. My term was seasonal but while I was there, the employees were nice and helpful. They gave a drug test onsite for orientation."
good,"Starting as a sixteen year old I was making more than enough money to get by in my mom's house, paying my own phone bill and care insurance and I wasn't making the MOST within my age group at this company. The managers are BY THE BOOK as they should be but they weren't a bother. I enjoyed the job overall."
good,Una buena oportunidad para poder empezar a trabajar
good,Pay is good and most co workers are amazing. Management is definitely struggling but it’s always an up and down with that store. Not much room to grow.
good,the management at Polo Ralph Laurent Factory outlet was terrible. The management made it not a fun job to go to. Co workers were a lot of fun to be around and made it tolerable to go to work. I learned how to communicate with customers. Hardest part of the job was to know where everything was because there was always floor changes happening every week and managers would not tell us if we did not know.
good,Working at polo was a cool experience the people there was respectful and it was a good working environment. They had a cafe so the breaks werr more relaxed and it was 8 hour shifts with occasionally working the weekends.
good,Ralph Lauren was fairly relaxed in their corporate environment. Everyone was friendly and open to new comers. It was a bit of an interesting time when I was there because of the multiple CEO changes and shifting cultural landscape.
good,"the job isnt hard at all. you just fol clothes smile and give bags to guest all day, although it can be very mindless at times and mentally draining when you do the same exact thing in the same exact spot for 2 hours +"
good,fun great people to work with hate i left but i had personal things to take care of really wish i could go back job was straight forward and i really like the warehouse feild.
good,"Typical day at work consisted of helping customers select appropriate styles of apparel that interests them.  Also stocking inventory and managing cash registers."
good,"Stressful work environment, lot's of tasking and unrealistic goals in a timely fashion. Not a lot of support and hearing out the associates. Although this is a great stepping stone and the training is amazing, you can learn so much here and go on to any retail or customer service driven environment and be easily adaptable."
good,"Stressful work environment, lot's of tasking and unrealistic goals in a timely fashion. Not a lot of support and hearing out the associates. Although this is a great stepping stone and the training is amazing, you can learn so much here and go on to any retail or customer service driven environment and be easily adaptable."
good,"* I would pack clothes in boxes."
good,"One of the best-known company in the industry. Polo Ralph Lauren management some are good and other you can guess, the schedule is minimum hours you receive the maximum of 25 hours. and if they ask you to stay. they are too Bossie. they raised you 35 cent a year."
good,"Nice clothes"
good,"Constant shift in management and employees, projects ever shifting priority due to change in staff. Scale of certain projects would grow depending on circumstance. Certain situations did not have guidelines to follow so you would have to create your own."
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,"Lots of good skills I learned and how to communicate well with others. I really did enjoy this job, but I feel that I need another job that better suits my needs. I also need a job that can pay more so I can support myself comfortably."
good,"If you are pursuing a degree, do not recommend staying here long term. It is great to help you get by in school. Management was fun but the drama leaked over into the open so we always knew when something was up."
good,"The company is great, they allow a lot of advancement in a short amount of time. They have great fashion advice and knowledge so you can transfer those skills to something else if you have to."
good,"Best place to start for a first time job, laid back and always willing to work around schooling activities. Where I learned all I know about customer service and how to handle money. Coworkers weren't just coworkers they were like a big family and management made you feel the same way."
good,"Overall great company, with growth within. Great compensation.. Employees are great to work with.  Great discount. Love the fact every wears uniform.."
good,"Pros "
good,"Belle maison"
good,Staff are always upbeat and determined to offer superior customer service and provide detailed recommendations. Flexible scheduling.
good,"As a brand manager it is my responsibility to motivate my team to achieve positive results. My performance is measured through sales, service and standards, ensuring that every customer that shops with me is given individual VIP experience. My achievements to date are winning an overall regional competition twice for selling the most products within the London area. I always hit targets and have had the highest productivity within the flagship store meaning I am always striving to excel my personal goals."
good,I was only an associate and i typically focused on customer service and recover store standards and manage money. Management was not great at developing team members. The hardest part of the job was trying get training in other areas to move up in the company.
good,I liked meeting new people and having them come back as regular customers.Management fot the most part was good. Co-workers were fine. Hardest part was dealing with unhappy customers.
good,"My role involved:"
good,"Hier heb ik altijd met veel plezier gewerkt."
good,"A typical day would at Ralph Lauren starts at 5 am with shipment orders. I learned to coordinate, sort, floor sets visuals, and garment care new merchandise.  Management assist as well with concerns as needed very laid-back and helpful resources. I love working with clothes and Ralph Lauren is my favorite brand."
good,"Responsible for ordering, receiving, opening, storing and replenishing the supplies and merchandise of the store."
good,Working with RL was a great experience for me. I absolutely enjoyed working with the customers and building relationships with them. All of the employees were team workers!
good,"Assisting customers and being a brand ambassador. Learned back stock, cashier position and floor lead roles. Not a bad job for students."
good,I like working there but the ended to soon. It was a great experience
good,a hard working crew of managers made the job less stressful everyone worked together and took the slack from others so daily work days went very smooth
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,"working for this company was an excellent experience, great management team and co workers"
good,Stock team is a great way to find experience in working in such a great environment
good,"Todos los días comenzaban igual. Había surtido que colocar tanto en tienda como en almacén. Muchos de los días esto no tenía ningún problema en hacerlo, pero en fechas señaladas como rebajas, navidad... era un caos. Teníamos almacenes llenos y aún así seguía viniendo mercancía y en tienda pasaba lo mismo. No teníamos sitio para implantar en tienda, y muy pocas veces venía gente de la firma a ayudarnos. El ambiente en general era bueno tanto por los compañeros como por la firma en si. Teníamos reuniones, donde nos enseñaban las colecciones q íbamos a vender según la temporada. En general ha sido una buena experiencia, lo único q no tenías posibilidad de promoción en la firma. siempre estabas en el mismo puesto."
good,"The management was good.  The majority of co-workers are students. It is an easy job.  If a person likes the customer service, it is a nice place to work."
good,"I am already 4 years and 6 months old in Ralph Lauren shop at Mall of the Emirates. I started as store keeper and later on they have given me a chance to be Sales Attendant and Sometimes as Cashier."
good,"A typical work day, I would come into work, clock in and grab my head set radio. Read all the goals for the day and the goal for the month. The manager would talk with us for brief second to catch everyone up on any changes in the store, then assign us to were she wanted us for the day. I would be placed on being a cashier for a few hours, a greeter, assisting customers with any questions and/or concerns. I would also be placed in the stock room and take care of any projects that needed to be done. I learned how to use a touch screen register, it was super easy and I enjoyed cashing people out. I learned what the process is like to open up a new store. It was fun to work with so many people and after a week to see the finished work. To know that all of us together built the inside of the store and made it look truly amazing. The co-workers there were awesome to work with. Everyone had a good energy and positive attitudes. The hardest part of my job, was having a difficult customer. But, we would all pull together to do our best in making the customer happy. The most enjoyable part of the job is being around everyone I worked with. They were the best people I ever had a chance to work with."
good,"Working for the company was a great learning experience, although advancement was difficult and the pay did not compensate for the amount of hours needed for the job."
good,"Work as a sales associate helping customers determine their size, information about care of clothing and what collections fit into their lifestyle.  Co-workers and atmosphere very pleasant.  I enjoy talking with and helping customers from all over the world."
good,"I learned alot while working at Polo. The management, was exceptional always will to assist and teach. I mad a lot of friends working at polo. The hardest part of the job was doing inventory. the most enjoyable part of the job interacting with costumers."
good,it was ok... i worked very early shifts...5 am-1pm. Depends on the person I suppose.
good,"I enjoy my time at work. It is a family oriented company. Honestly there isn't much growth within the company. I've seen people work there for years and still hold the same position. Hours are not the best, either is the pay. Management has some work to do with keeeping everyone on the same page. Since I've been there I've learned serveal things. Such as opening and closing a store, meeting standards, and expanding in many different languages every day. I've also learned the things not to do when I start my own clothing line and expand as that company did."
good,工作日常還好員工態度ok，不過要埋堆先得，其次係店鋪中學到很多待客之道，為自己提高了很多經驗，管理層ok啦
good,"Though the company culture is to own the store and manager your business, visual and PR teams create chaos daily by moving the store and disrupting business"
good,Management should encompass the culture of the workplace. My tenure at Ralph Lauren has shown me how focusing on employees helps sales more than focusing solely on sales
good,This is a great place to work. The managers and corporate partners are easy to get in contact with for the needs of the business. They are very hands on with career and people development. I would recommend anyone with great energy and customer focus to work with this company.
good,"Working at RL, you feel secure and for the most part everyone is very nice. The company offers many perks, including environmental friendly activities that are very relevant the world in general. They offer the option of work/ life balance."
good,Polo Ralph Lauren is a good company to work for. I spent more that one year there. I don't think they pay fairly and also the don't pay for lunch. Good environment.
good,"I like working at that place is very calm, I can handle it and I have experience with it so I know I can do the job. It’s a safe environment and it was a new opportunity."
good,Ralph Lauren was a brilliant first step into a world of work. It offered guidance and direction whilst always being kept busy and under a workload. Would recommend for anyone starting out in work.
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,"Was a positive experience and good company to work for.  Position was remote and based from home, but with daily store visits and communication to accounts.  Requires good time management and commitment to working well independently."
good,"It  was a very high volume store, at that time it was the second largest on the West Coast. Keeping our sales floor stocked was a constant priority. We had to ensure our stock rooms were well organized, so we could manage the merchandise flow. I learned that being organized was of major importance, so that we could readily replenish stock. I believe that are biggest challenge was keeping the floor stocked and recovered. I found we had best results having small  a crew to constantly recover, and stock. The most enjoyable "
good,"overall it was just an alright job was i was in college, flexible scheduling. Fun environment if you enjoy interacting with customers and showing them exactly what outfits work best"
good,Customer service and then during down times straightening the clothes. Occasionally manager will put you on various task. Good first job opportunities for advancement if focused
good,Polo is a innovative company the I enjoy working for. Benefits are fair & hours are flexible. Management is very easy going & understanding. Opportunity to advance within the company is always available.
good,packing & shipping the clothes making sure we pack the right amount of pieces into a box seal the boxes & send it down the line . the industrial part was a little different we folded the clothes & sent them down the line from the top of the warehouse down to the shipping part it was called ecom .
good,"Polo was fun to work at especially working along side my cousin. Staff was great, Management was awesome, and the Scheduling was always flexible. They really care about the health of their employees as well."
good,Ralph Lauren is great place to work! All North Carolina campuses have motivating environments. I mostly enjoyed the opportunity to have a conversation with the CEO.
good,I believe Ralph Lauren is headed in a great direction but they currently are still missing the mark in certain parts of the business. They are allowing more freedoms and starting to operate like a good company vs a good brand.
good,Great place to advance with proper mentorship. With proper leadership the team is ran effectively; leading to ultimate success. Great place for younger individuals to succeed.
good,"As an assistant at Ralph Lauren, I was given the task of attending to customers to help make"
good,"It was an average job for a high schooler. Some of the managers were relaxed but others were very strict. It was a lot of cleaning up, as the store as 90% of the time, a mess."
good,Le poste de vendeur chez Ralph Lauren est une bonne expérience.
good,"Very respectful and kind staff.  Easy job for the most part, folding clothes and interacting with people.  However, management will replace you in a heart beat because of one manager."
good,"My responsibilities were to recover areas, give customers shopping totes for them to buy a lot of clothes. Assist all customers needs. Greet customers walking ion to store."
good,"Ralph Lauren ist ein guter Arbeitgeber, intern kam es jedoch ab und zu Streitigkeiten."
good,"Wednesday we are always loading trailers with dillards, macys, khoals, and live loads. I learned live loads only take five minutes. Sometimes FedEx is backup and busy. Some boxes Is heavy. Always lift with your knees not back, be safe and smart on the work floor."

good,"Productive and fun place to Work Acquired a great amount skills, Build great Relationships with Customers and Staff Including Management. Excellent Apparel."
good,"I enjoyed working here. It was very busy at times, but I enjoyed most of everyone I worked with and customers. Some sales associates worked harder than others, but management did appreciate good, hard workers and they noticed. The benefits are good too, like discounts."
good,"- Great place to kickstart your career in sales"
good,Ralph Lauren is a great company to work for.  The day to day routine is always different and exciting.  It's amazing to meet new people and make connections along the way.
good,"Ralph Lauren, gave me an opportunity to excell and learn retail techniques such as, customer service skills. "
good,Good job but lack of career advancement is what would make someone want to leave this company. Good amount of PTO and good work/life balance but needs to work on career advancement
good,"Worth joining the team to learn a lot of technical skills."
good,"I love the Ralph Lauren brand! I enjoy working with customers and finding the perfect outfit or gift for any occasion. The discount they supply is great, so I can wear it and sell it!"
good,"Reçu une formation de base en vente et les valeurs de l'entreprise. Beaucoup aimé le contact avec la clientèle. Par contre, compte tenu du fait qu'il s'agissait de l'ouverture d'un nouveau magasin dans un nouveau centre commercial, les gestionnaires ont eu quelques défis imprévus qui ont eu des impacts sur leur gestion du personnel."
good,"A typical day at work is cleaning in the morning. Seeing if there is any orders that need to be shipped (FOTHY). Pull the report, transfer items to the floor. Run the rack. Provide the Ralph Lauren Customer service experience, work as cashier, sales associate and in the fitting room."
good,I enjoyed working there for the most part. What I did not like was the mandatory over time and working on holidays. The was ok. The benefits were great!
good,"Polo, was a wonderful place to work for and a great team to work with. Polo was an amazing place to start as a retail job."
good,Overall the company was good to work for. An average day at Ralph Lauren is pretty busy and it makes it go by very fast. Most of my coworkers are pretty good and help out.
good,"Love the job, with lots of different culture, not very good management. Help individual Chinese customer at all times. The most enjoyable part of the job is appreciation and thank you from the customer."
good,"The staff at Ralph Lauren was enjoyable, but their schedules were always crowded and very confusing. More often than not co-workers would call in and we would have to scramble to find a replacement for the day."
good,good work life balance. the team is very well managed as well as the employees. offer many oppertunnity for improvement as well as very desereved overtime.
good,Retail is not for everyone i dont like it but ralph lauren was okay because of the discounts but you aways but be doing something which is normal working but they asked me to do extra like security make sure people were not stealing
good,"great people, great energy, great culture and people. pay and advancement was one of my struggles while working here.great place to work get perks not enough benifits and pay."
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,This store sees a ton of traffic so there is never a dull moment working retail. They often promote from within so there is opportunity for advancement. You become great friends with your coworkers.
good,"Overall the company is nice, good incentives, but it wasn't enough work for me to do/ not many hours given. I was working doing the season and I were able to meet and help a lot of people."
good,"Ralph Lauren is a big company with a long developed history.  eCommerce team was brand new and we worked like a mini Ralph Lauren office.  Because eCommerce team has our own Merchandising team, Finance team, Marketing team, IT, Production team.  Each teams work very closely together."
good,"One of the only companies to invest time in training the employees to make sure they can perform to the best of their ability, and what I learned from Polo has helped me in other companies."
good,I hope the changes they are making right now really can help it to stay afloat.  Company is going thru restructure and layoffs in the past couple years.
good,Good company needs to connect with millennial generation to stay relevant.  Great opportunity for advancement and learn more. The provide great resources and training for employees.
good,"Dont expect any ideas you may have to get anywhere. Even as part of the management team in store, my requests to change how some procedures were done fell on deaf ears. This led to lack of confidence from my staff, who were also frustrated with how certain inventory procedures were tracked and maintained. "
good,"I started working at RL soon after college.  It was a great place to work; the best job I ever had.  However, with increasing competition from nimble internet fashion companies and new executive management, it seems like there are more opportunities elsewhere."
good,"As a Sales Associate of Polo Ralph Lauren, he or she is usually assigned in a shop, store or boutique. He or she is responsible for all sales activities in a store. He or she works within the sales and support teams for the achievement of customer satisfaction, generation of revenue and long-term account goals in line with the company’s vision and values. He or she should maintain a warm courteous contact with all the clients in the store or shop area to ensure high levels of client satisfaction."
good,This is a great place to work. I would recommend this company to others. It is good because they are very flexible with your work life balance.
good,I organized all online orders and filled them for all of the local areas. I ran the shop for the Girl Scouts to purchase uniforms as well as all supplies and gift items that was needed. Traveled to camps to sell items there as well. Enjoyed the position.
good,Every moment the management has they ask there employees to stay over for work. A typical day of work is folding clothes and helping the customers. I learned how important it is to help the customers. My co-workers where very friendly and helpful. The hardest part of my job was just doing the same thing everyday all day. The part I enjoyed the most was all the discounts
good,Great place to work although at times can be overwhelming.  Difficult to balance work and life due to consistent schedule change.
good,Ralph Lauren cares about their associates but needs to step up their game when it comes to technology and the changes in brick and mortar retail.
good,"Depending on the season, it may be a very slow and boring day at Polo, or a fun and busy day as we may have many customers especially during holiday seasons."
good,"Not a lot of growing opportunities. Other than that great team plenty of hard workers, friendly people. They are very flexible like if a family emergency comes up, illness, etc. The hardest part about this job is probably costumers and traffic but the number of friendly costumers outweighs the number of rude ones. You learn a lot in a store that take the level of standards with the level they do, skills that will help you get any retail job afterwards"
good,"enjoyed working in the store, loved the one on one contact every day with customers. Management was top notch and went out of their way to teach you what you needed to know about retail and customer satisfaction. i was disappointed with the way they would tell you of changes and or advancement that never would take place . I had high hopes with this company and would get very excited at the promise of advancement, it was a great let down when growth and advancement would not happen and management would put off any explanation or action, this was the only issue I ever had while working at this company, otherwise one of the greatest companies to work for if you want part time only, for this is all they offer unless you are management."
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,"A typical day at work would be very busy, many language barriers were faced but I learnt to have a lot of patiences. The hardest part of work was keeping up with the movement of stock and the most enjoyable part of work was enjoying my time with my co workers"
good,"I really enjoyed working at RL due to the high level of skill, experience, and creative opportunities that came with the job."
good,"Sales."
good,"A great place to jump-start a career.  The place is very focused on what you can do instead of how pretty you are, which is something not many retail stores take account for."
good,"Customer relation and doing the best of all, has "
good,"a typical day at work is scanning bringing in deliveries processing and floor firsting the product,ive learnt how to maintain a good pace to ensure that deliveries are done in a certain time,i know how to scan in deliveries process paper work and am also till trained,my co workers are fun to work with and help you when needed,the hardest part of the job is making sure everything is done and put away before finishing shift,the most enjoyable part of the job is that we all work together as a family."
good,"Overdag erg rustig meestal. Ik heb daar niet veel geleerd ik moest klanten helpen en opvouwen."
good,"I enjoy my days at Ralph Lauren. I come in and get to work both independently and as a team, and I am provided with all the necessary tools and equipment to perform my job duties. I enjoy being challenged and having an opportunity to create new and innovative reports and procedures. I am required to do a lot of different things for a lot of different people/departments simultaneously which can be stressful at times, but the overall experience as a Ralph Lauren employee is satisfying at this stage of my career."
good,"Folding clothes, stocking the shelves, and organizing the back room. Meeting new people was fun. Having to wear their clothes, not so much. I had amazing relationships with the managers, its too bad I got replaced so quickly or I would have gone back."
good,"ottima azienda lavorativa con pero' forse ancora qualche problema di gestione sia del personale sia nella logistica , comunque ottimo ambiente a livello umano."
good,Came in to learn something new everyday . Great team great managers . As time passed things got switched up and schedule was unstable.
good,typical day at work for me was very productive and surrounded around customer satisfaction.
good,"A typical day at work is steady but not busy. I have learned how to greet and make a customer feel welcome into the store. I've also learned how to stock shelves, keep my area neat, assist customers when they need help, and worker the cashier. Management is very organized and precise with what they are striving to reach. Working with co-workers was fun and a joy to always wanting to come to work again. The hardest part on the job is when its really busy and trying to assist a lot of customers on a really busy day. The most enjoyable part on the job is just being there and enjoying the role or task that is giving."
good,"I enjoy interacting with the public, being challenged to make sales quotas and working with the entire team."
good,"Everday working for Polo was competitive. Somedays more then others, but the managers have certain exspectations and we had to achieve them. Working in receiving made me create a trust with co-workers that you dont do on a regular. You have to believe and trust that the team your working with will accomplish daily goals."
good,"Diverse  Environment, Reliable Brand"
good,Lots of opportunity to work in different departments which allows for constant growth.  Company that recognizes their employees.  Company if very large and did not always offer fun events like a smaller company would offer.
good,"great people and an awesome job, payed very well and strongly recommended. responsibilities were easy going and you worked on it yourself. management was nice."
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,"A typical day at Polo Ralph Lauren includes reorganising and replenishing stock to visual model store guidelines. When the store opens the main priority is customers and the service we provide to make their experience as pleasurable as possible. "
good,"great starting salary, heavy emphasis on weekends and holidays, customers at outlet location were crazy, management did not communicate well with employees or with eachother"
good,Day to day life in Ralph Lauren is never the same and you have a lot of work to do and help to get the job done at hand and are expected to be able to work on your own at times. The people really do get you through the working day the team is like a family.
good,High expectations for an outlet location. Learning and Development is at your fingertips. Fast-paced work that is as fun and/or challenging as you make it.
good,A typical day is usually not very busy. We have the same group of customers that come in. I learned more about how polo operates as a whole. The management can be a little better. It's a pretty good job to have or a career building opportunity. The most enjoyable part is when we have a set sales goal and reach and even exceed that amount.
good,Ralph Lauren is a legendary design house that I was very proud and honored to work for. Their reputation for high end home decor grew quickly at the time I worked for the company.
good,"Management and the employee's were friendly, nice and very respectable.   We were offered reasonable employee discounts as well as flexible schedules."
good,"I love working here, its perfectly team oriented. I have been working here for almost two years and its been a wonderful experience and I have learned a lot about myself and how to work with others. Working in retail will never be easy and it will always take a lot of patients to work with the public."
good,"In this place there's no time for slacking off or having nothing to do, you're always thriving to improve yourself and the company, you develop as a salesman and as a person. You get to know people better and understand them by helping them and listening to them. You can also improve in teamwork and initiative since the opportunity will be there for both. You'll grow professionally and in your interpersonal and communication skills. The hardest part is having to be standing up and moving the whole day, but you can and will get your breaks."
good,Working at Polo had its ups and downs. It is a very fun workplace but can get busy and down to business. I learned many languages working at Polo. Taught me about different cultures different types of people in the world. Dealing with people and always problem solving every situation. I learned to never give up no matter how little or big the problem is. Last is that I got work done and learned everything I could possibly.
good,"stand up to 8 hours a day only 30 min break."
good,"First off I would love to thank the Ralph Lauren family for the opportunity. We shared plenty of great memories and never had one negative day on the job, everybody was so positive. None of that could've been possible without the great managment around the store. They kept the workplace under control and that made it easy to work in any situation. I learned a lot from different skills to some things about myself and I feel like that was very important for those lesson to be placed upon me at a time in my life where Im constantly trying to figure things out."
good,"etre polyvalent, tous les jours des nouvelles missions. travail agreable avesc une equipe au top"
good,"I only worked for the outlet store for 6 months while juggling 2 other jobs. They worked with my schedule, coworkers and managers were friendly, wasn't too labor intensive, it was an overall good experience."
good,"Ralph Lauren was a great company with a few flaws. The contact center has no organization whatsoever! The managers and floor coordinators are all over the place. You get different answers from everyone, thus not knowing what to tell the customer. It made it super hard to assist the customers. Corporate would keep making us do more and more, with less and less pay, and less time on the phone with the customer. They would keep dropping sales, which would make more phone calls come in. The management team from the corporate level to the management team in the contact center has no respect for the employees, which is really sad, considering it is Ralph Lauren. I truly love the brand, the lifestyle and everything. The management team kills it."
good,"The work experience in Polo was lively and worth while. Definitely a good first job, but not as professional as one would assume. Although I'm definitely missing the discount opportunity right now."
good,working at polo ralph lauren is a wonderful experience in itself. we received great discounts up to 30% as well as the marked down prices on clothing apparel.
good,"Working here at Christmas time must be one of the most difficult jobs in retail. However, if you like a challenge and decent pay this could be for you. Needing to communicate with stockroom employees whilst exchanging information with customers simultaneously is hard but worthwhile and fulfilling is successful. Staff are all lovely however some of the managers are not very nice or helpful I found."
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,"Learned a lot working here and enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere and good benefits package. Has a lot of great trainings you can take to fine-tune your skills."
good,Ralph Lauren is a great company - I was impressed with the leaders and their ability to sell and market to the customer. The Miami location really pushed extra add ons to the customer because our customer base was mostly international travelers who stocked up on clothes during their vacation.
good,"Enjoyed my role and felt a valued and respected member of the team. Learnt a lot in regards to the retail sector and the process of how stores are ran,"
good,"Open- Check payroll, run expected inbound freight numbers, check emails and update promotions if necessary. "
good,"Fue una experiencia muy positiva, el ambiente de trabajo es bueno, el equipo humano es fantástico."
good,dans mon plan personnelle cela fut une riche expérience et je leur témoigne de la sympathie et leur présente de l admiration
good,"Ralph Lauren is a great company to work for. Currently, there has been a lot of changes in senior management which has caused a lot of uncertainty. The company culture is great, people are nice and easy to work with. Work life balance is pretty good."
good,When working here it's all about the customers. Make sure you are doing the best you can at all times. The managers are always watching you. Make sure you take your breaks on time and come back on time.
good,"I really enjoyed working here. It was hard to balance life and work due to long hours and holiday work. However, I learned a lot and built a lot of relationships. It helped me develop myself both personally and professionally. Everyone was so pleasant to work with. If fashion or retail operations is something you are passionate about then this job is a great starting point. You get to do and learn a little bit about everything."
good,"Very supportive work environment, management encourages employees to be come their best.  Employees undergo training to help them to become more productive."
good,Have worked at RL for 13.5 years.  The people are great and the benefits are too.  Over the years I have seen good management and bad.  That is true of any workplace.
good,"Is a good place to start, if you have no labor experience. Managers are nice and coworkers help you. You learn about customer service and how to help somebody who doesn't even speak your language. Is a good experience."
good,"Good place to work, not exactly the BEST ever. Good hours, but at times can feel a bit stagnant. When you work as a business consultant in fashion, there are certain things you must get used to, including making financial decisions not based on numbers and facts. Can be frustrating, but the company itself is exciting and fun at times."
good,Processing shipment based on company standards. 100% Customer service is key. Genuine conversation can go a long way when trying to create lasting impressions. The most enjoyable part of this job is the staff and the close knit family that has been created. Management has been a bumpy road but each day things are getting better.
good,Ralph Lauren is a great place to work because of just who they are but the management is not all that. There are times where they will in place different things that aren't good for the workers.
good,"It was an ok job, but I'm looking for an company that I can grow in and be working till Retirement. Management was ok and it was fun sometimes. I learned the basic work."
good,Managers are great and work is easy for the most part. However you are expected to uphold the integrity of the job to the fullest extent.
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,Lots of fun people to work with very fast-paced environment you get a good workout loading trucks great cafeteria open store was magnificent overall great place to work
good,Compensation is livable and better than most retail chain stores. Company liked to hire management from the outside and promote from within only to team leaders or supervisors. Employees were easy to get along with and management always tried to connect and make the job enjoyable and fun.
good,"I met a lot of incredible and talented people. I looked forward to arriving in the office and seeing that challenges awaited me to tackle and resolve."
good,Have to learn a lot to take on high responsibilities. Respectable company with good training provided. Strong heritage brand.
good,"Ralph Lauren "
good,"The hardest part was trying to find the isles that the order had to be picked from. "
good,I worked at Polo Ralph Lauren Factory store part-time while I was in college full-time.  This was a great job to gain experience working in customer service and learning more about the retail workplace.  The management team at this location was great!  They worked with my school schedule so well and didn't have an issue scheduling around different breaks throughout the year.  This was my first retail position that allowed me to learn more about working one on one with customers to provide the best customer experience while they are shopping at the outlet store.  I was also able to gain experience using registers and learned time management when working with multiple customers at one time.  I really like the coworkers I worked with as well.  They were very open to helping me learn about the retail job field.
good,"My 12 and half years at Ralph Lauren were a gift. Inspiring both professionally and personally."
good,"Loved most of my direct counterparts, and really learned a lot from my direct supervisor, who had spent a large part of his career at Ralph Lauren.  Many of the more senior people in the company -- even middle managers -- have been there for a very long time."
good,Enjoy working at the store. Fast paced business always keeps you busy. Co workers are fun to work with. Management assist with helping provide excellent customer service. Everyone works as a team to provide great service to our guest.
good,Everyone got along. Good job while in highs chool or college. No real chance for advancement. Good start for learning the art of sales.
good,"One of the most enjoyable parts of this job was the discount,i got to meet a lot of great people, great work environment. Also, the managers were pretty cool, tried to make the work day breeze by."
good,"It was a good company to work for and people that I have worked with treated each other just like family."
good,"High energy, pace, and team oriented. Departments work well together for a purpose. Management can interact with their teams more which would lead to even a higher dedicated drive from the teams."
good,Great flexibility.  Company has great pride in brand and that shows through the employees. Pay is a little low but the discount is very good.
good,"Empresa que eu gostava muito de trabalhar aprendi bastante la ,minha gerente era uma mae para todas nos ,trabalhavam todas em equipe,a parte mais dificil era trabalhar 15 horas por dia e tambem final de semana"
good,"Managers sold me defective merchandises.Aka poorly stiched polos etc.."
good,"A typical work day was a very balanced fun day. We all had our own tasks to do, and very fair. I learned how to be a manager when working for this company, and how I would like to run a store one day myself. My co-corkers all helped to make the day go by faster by doing there job with a smile on there face. The hardest part of this job was having to learn how keep track of all the sales associates."
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,"Management and employees feel like one big family and a lot of great relationships can be formed here, but this is a high demand company placed near one of the biggest theme parks on the east coast (Six Flags Great Adventure), so expect to have heavy workloads and learn to be adept at a it of everything, even jobs outside of your routine ""job description"", you will definitely become a well rounded sales associate and/or manager at Ralph Lauren."
good,"I might work a 6-9 hour shift. For about a third of the time I took the responsibility as one of the supervisors for the store. I made sure employees were doing their jobs and where they were supposed to be. I would help customers with their complaints or returns. For about another third of the shift, I would be merchandising the women's side of the store. I would keep the store stocked and displayed in an appealing way. The last third I would act as a sales associate. I might run the register, assist in the fitting room, fold clothes, or help customers with picking out their clothes."
good,"The learning curve is very steep, as there is so much inspiration and design stimulus in the working environment. One becomes a better designer through the challenging work, and the expertise in their colleagues."
good,"My average day was spent managing the budget for the creative spend, that meant that all the window displays, mannequins etc. had to come from a particular planned spend that needed to be monitored closely. I worked in a very close team where we all helped each other complete daily tasks. Sometimes I would be helping with visual displays and store set up and other times I would be assisting the team PA in setting up calendar events, meetings etc. "
good,"Me perfeccione en lo que a gestión se refiere, tanto de equipo como de la  tienda en si."
good,Nice fast paced work place with great management team. It was just too far for everyday travel because it was at the state line.
good,"A typical day at work is just your typical retail job, you punch in, fold and make sure the product is stocked. Helping customers or aggressively pursuing them. You will be standing on your feet for a long time, comfortable shoes are a must!"
good,RL is an amazing company with a thriving culture. Employees are not compensated fairly
good,great experiences every day
good,"My job was to cash out customers and keep store in order. These responsibilites included returns and exchanges, mark downs, and keeping the store organized and stocked."
good,They understand family life which is unexpected in a work force.
good,"Extremely productive, and communication between all workers was phenomenal. Learned the fundamentals of working at retail, and also how to satisfy every costumers"
good,Very easy and no hassle. Stressful during the holidays with rush orders. The management team was supportive and understanding. They worked around your request and made sure you were satisfied.
good,Hours Is horrible give you no time for life out side of work weekends are a must but you get a  50% discount NOT WORTH IT IF YOU HAVE A SOCIAL LIFE the culture is not always there people will throw you under the bus for a raise  willthrowyouinfront of the bus for get a dase
good,It was fun working with the people who were there at the time. The atmosphere was welcoming as were the employees. The dress code was nice as well. Laid back
good,apart from hr function that was really non existing every thing (at that time ) was brilliant to work for. Bister village is a place where work doesn't feel hard.
good,"Really friendly working environment. They had extra hours available around Christmas and were also very flexible around my university schedule"
good,"Basically just talking to customers ,smiling, and helping out keep the place clean. I like to do extra so I did stock check and take inventory on the items we need, and counting money at the end of the day."
good,Great people great benefits if retail was my focus that would I company I would love to be with. My coworkers were like family I respect every body that worked there.
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,"Its a great place to work. Workplace culture has improved a lot.  The job is great, training is given. Management team are all friendly, easy to talk to."
good,I had interned with the Creative Services Department at Ralph Lauren Home and I was amazed by how much responsibility and trust was involved. It was a great place to learn about working in a larger corporation and people are always open to helping others within the company.
good,It was a good job they had us do fun and stuff and the management was not too bad. They were laid back and let us have our conversations. It was a good start up job.
good,"Customer Service focused 100% as it should be.  Good place to work as the pressure to get jobs accomplished is not too much.  Just the right amount of ""push"" in all areas to make the operation work."
good,I've enjoyed my time at RL and still think its a good place to work. The company cares for its employees and the benefits are good too. Safety is very important.....
good,"A typical day at work during the week would be pretty laid back due no one really coming into the store, just because it was a weekday and the mall isn't really busy around that time. I learned to always find something to do even when you think there's nothing to do or there's nothing left to do at all. The management  I would say definitely has their good days and is always reaching for a goal. The hardest part of the job would be some technical things. For example, learning how to do certain things like orders and certain returns. The most enjoyable part of the job would be, being able to work with the people that have the same passion as you and getting along with others."
good,"I want to work again here.because I am looking for online jobs that is form filling , copy paste data , or others.so plz give me a chance for job and I want to join this by email.so I will wait of email."
good,"Working here would have been a lot better if there were better managers. I absolutely hated coming to work when 1 certain manager was around. "
good,"The store in orange is great because it’s a small store. Managers are great, but the store needs reliable staff. retail is retail, they need better work life balance."
good,team corroborative work place. Everyone helps each other if not one person can slow down the whole process of motion in the store on helping the customers and getting them to the cashiers then out the door to help another customer right after and restart that whole process every time.
good,"Polo Ralph Lauren was a great place to work. The energy from the coworkers was always great and it made going to work pleasant. Even though some customers may challenge you, it is a great feeling when you found the product that satisfy them."
good,I was a cashier and I had to always greet the customers. Our customers were treated as guests. We were also in charge of picking up phone calls. We had to fold clothes and return it to its place at the end of the day and we cleaned our spots out as well. Management was a good and fair team. The hardest part was probably how fast paced it was working there and having to ask every customer for their information. But overall you get use to it and before you know it you are a pro!
good,"A great learning experience in customer service and inventory management, as well as a good introduction into receiving and cataloging shipments. Overall a positive experience."
good,I enjoy working with my peers. Could be busy days but makes the day go by fast. Very flexible with schedules. Managers are lenient but help you do your job good.
good,This company's management structure was very top heavy and as a result felt somewhat fragmented at times.  The compensation and benefits were very fair for the position I was in but work/life balance was sometimes a challenge.
good,"Worked here durning High School, this was a great starter kind of job. Was able to get the basic training skills that I would need for the jobs that fallowed."
good,"This was one of my first jobs out of college, so I didn't have a ton of experience when I went to work there.  I learned a LOT and got a great company to put on my resume, however, I had to work two part-time jobs in addition to full-time at this job just to pay rent in New York City.  Lots of opportunity to advance from within."
good,"fun work place with great co workers, hover some people do get lazy because it is a part time low paying job, however it does work well if you are going to school or working on something es and only need the job as a part time."
good,"it's great as far as work hours go when you are looking for a job that has plenty of work during the holiday season I.e. October, November & December."
good,"You cannot beat the benefits, bar none.  Are the hours crazy, yes.  As a temp, you can work here forever if you have good attitude, performance and attendance.  If you are a full time associate, you cannot beat the vacation and days off.  Great coworkers and easy work. Also, very good deals on Polo items."
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,"a typical day would be to get your goal sales plan, i learned how to follow routines, and i learned new things every day. management was strong. the most enjoyable part was getting to work in a social setting and connect with the customers."
good,"I can say it was one of the best jobs I have had."
good,I personally liked everyone that worked there I’m very nice to all people they all helped me gain communication skills by showing me what I should say or do in certain situations.
good,"Not really a difficult job, keeps you busy and have to move around a lot. Not really stressful and management was appreciable. Learning how to do scanning and reading codes for the work assigned."
good,"This would be an excellent first job or a job to jump start a career in management. The hours were usually not as appealing as someone with a family would prefer, but we did have some flexibility."
good,It was a very creative and hectic work environment.  Lots of challenges dealing with different departments and retail stores.   Overall great team players and interesting work.
good,"Arrive 30  minutes early. Review sales rally. Prepare to provide excellent customer service and assistance to sales associates as needed."
good,"A typical day at work involves dealing with a myriad of different situations, both on the floor and in the stockroom. You can easily be a regular associate, and meet the minimum requirements of the job, but those who are willing to learn and work will gain the trust of managers and be given opportunities to assume more responsibilities. Be prepared to undertake many responsibilities and put in many hours a week for a long time before recognition or advancement opportunities appear. This shouldn't discourage you though; this is a fun place to work for and you can definitely make a good amount of money if you prove yourself to be an invaluable employee. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fast paced environment that never gets boring unless you let it."
good,"The job is easy, but it can be stressful.  Sometimes it is difficult to handle the various jobs that they have you doing.  Some days you may not get your hours, depending on the units in the building and the manager. Sometimes they would take things overboard and like to stretch the work when it is unnecessary.  At times, they would work the full timers so much.  It can be forceful jobs."
good,Long hours w/ great people. Learned a lot in my 10.5 years here. My managers are phenomenal. Amazing to work w/ such creative people. Got to see Italy and China and work with some really amazing people.
good,"Ralph Lauren is a good company to work for. They, like many other fashion companies, are trying to re-establish themselves as relevant in today's ever-changing retail environment."
good,"Was a good job. My direct managers were great to work for. If they ever bring their IT back to the US, I would apply again. The benefits were good and the discount was spectacular."
good,I absolutely loved this job. Great clothing. The team was like family. I only left to take on a full time position with another company. I wish they would bring it back to the Valdosta area.
good,"Usually Busy in store, as it's the biggest on Cheshire oaks. Everyone in the store needs to be hard working to keep up Ralph Lauren standers whilst also give good customer service. the management are okay. The hardest part is working up the the standard of the store and what is expected. The other coleges are the best bit of the job as they are all nice, friendly people."
good,"This was my first Full Time position after working P/T to stay close to my children growing up.  I would not have left.  We were dislocated/ayed off.  The company moved the a/p dept to NC and I was not able to relocate at that time."

good,"After working at Ralph, you learn how to manage your time most efficiently, and begin to really understand how a busy retail environment works. As it is a designer brand it holds its standards high, but will still put the customers first. The most difficult part about working for the company is there is a lot expected of you and you always get thrown in at the deep end, with little actual training. All gthe staff are very friendly and always help each other out."
good,"This is probably suited for a younger person. In the 615 area advancement is slow paced. Unfortunately the better employee you are the less they're willing to work with your schedule if you need a day or two off, weird huh?"
good,This job was a really people friendly job. You get to meet people from all over the world and get a taste of different cultures. The hardest part of the job would be having to stand around all day.
good,Healthy environment. Every co worker is friendly and works great as a team. Communication is good. Managers treat every employee with respect and class
good,Place is wonderful to work at not boaring and very challenging on a day to day basis. Great place to gain self confidence with comunicating with all customers coming in every day

good,"The work life balance is great, but the layered structure of the organization causes roadblocks to quick execution. The culture promotes a pleasant interpersonal atmosphere."
good,"Typical day punch in, grab the RFID gun and processed in scanning the store(cycle count). Try to get the store to 100%. 8am rolls around next manager comes in and the count is done by 8am.I would count the drawers with other manager and put in the registers. Then after that's done read the replacement reports and refill the floor or work on shipment. At 9:40am meet in front of the store for daily sales rally. 10am we open and ready to start are day in providing world class customer service to all our customers. I have learned a lot about visuals and merchandising and creating a connection with the customers. Co workers were wonderful to work with. Hardest part of the job trying not to buy everything in the store. Most in enjoyable part is seeing a customer leave Happy and wanting to come back and shop with us."
good,"Enjoyed being around people and using my design skills. There was a fun work environment. Unless you were looking to be a manager , there was not room for growth....."
good,Fun work place. With mostly supportive management. Not all about number but how you grow personally and professionally. A lot of politics but its a huge store so that comes with the baggage.
good,"Very Busy Store In Orlando, I Learned So many aspects of the Company From Management And Supervisors. I Enjoyed Working with a Very Diverse Group,  I Learned alot about Their Cultures. Also Acquiring Many Skills With Electronic Devices , Computer Skills. I Always tried to keep up Moral with My Team Members, Both Professional & Personal. I feel the Hardest Part of the Job was Organization in Stores with Little Space For Product, However we did our best to Achieve Cleanliness of Our Store. The Most Enjoyable part of my job  everyday was Something Different."
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,"It felt like family time, everytime I went into work.."
good,"Improvement needs to be made with the system to organize and prioritize packages for delivery, communication between the mailroom staff and the clients, and team work between mailroom staff."
good,Most of the management team was great and always willing to work and teach you. The only negative things is we had a hand full of management that would have rather manage by power and not by knowledge which left a very uneasy feeling.
good,"I work part-time at D&S Ralph Lauren on Newbury St. in Boston. The work environment is very friendly. It is a small store and a lesser known Ralph Lauren brand, but the clothes are high end and speak to a certain clientele."
good,"Ralph Lauren is a great company to work for with a lot of opportunity.   There is always something new to learn, the other employees are the best.   The hardest part of the job is keeping up with emails and back of house needs."
good,"Working for them wasn't a typical desk job. I got the opportunity to connect with so many different people and help so many people while expanding my knowledge about fashion and clothing. Being a student, this job is definitely for someone who has time to dedicate."
good,"De collega's vangen je openlijk en leuk op "
good,Very fun if you like fashion! You get to meet so many different people depending on your store location and if it is just a regular stand off store or if it is located in a mall or outlet center. Management was very friendly co-workers are usually young and up to date with society. Discounts are AMAZING for employees.
good,"-My co-workers were very friendly and it was a lot of fun when working as a team during projects."
good,Costumers were always respected. coworkers were great other then the occasional gossip. the hardest part of this job was not spending your money on clothes. most enjoyable time were holidays.holidays are very busy which means nice checks
good,"This was my first real job. I loved the people I worked with especially the management. I was able to gain close relationships with each manager there. I had a lot of responsibilities while working there. Some of which included, cashier, floor set, truck delivery, supervising projects, and customer service."
good,"I was respected and motivated by the people I worked with. It is hard to find a company that keeps it's employees passionate and driven the way Ralph Lauren does. If only there were more opportunities open to move upward. And unfortunately when you leave the brand- they have a rule in place that won't allow you to come back. No matter how much they like you! I'll always love working for them, and will continue to hope for re-employment!"
good,I gained more retail experience. I enjoyed the customers and the employees were great to work with.
good,"Loved working at Polo Ralph Lauren. Well manged place, customer friendly, and just an overall good feel to it. Hours were inconsistent and that was the reason i ended my employment there."

good,This is a fast pace and very hands on work environment. Team work is important as most work is handle and completed cross functionally.
good,on a averag day its pretty busy. i wouldnt say i learned too much that i didnt already know from my previous retail jobs so it was easy. managment was okay but very strict. co worker all seemed friendly towards each other. i would say the hardest part of the job is breaking it to the customer that your out of their size. helping people find their wardrobe and making them smile would be the best part of the job
good,This company provided many opportunities to advance within the company. There are many different departments and locations nationally and abroad. However the work/life balanced could be improved. The company required employees to report to work even when there was severally inclement weather that made it unsafe to travel.
good,"The best part of working there was the time that all levels of management (District, Regional, etc) took to develop you to a better manager. There is so much opportunity with this company as long as you are a hard worker. The hardest part was the overnighters, and getting there so early in the morning."

good,"I enjoyed most of the staff despite high turnover. I loved the product and the structure in place. Organization was the major obsticle for my position but my team rose to the challenge on a daily basis. I've had opportunities for advancement but I was preparing to move. "
good,"everyday in polo is a busy day, from cashiering to customer service the managent is amazing. the hardest part of the job was not having a set schedule."
good,I love the workplace and environment. Helping customers and seeing the new trends in fashion was fun. Never really had a issue with the management and customers.
good,I worked here while in high school and I loved it.  All my supervisors and managers were great.  They had great training for new employees and answered all questions.
good,Working at Ralph Lauren was a all together decent experience but I need to find me a job closer to my house because driving to Kernersville every day was a little ride
good,"Polo is a good job for someone who is looking to just have a few hours a few, for me I like it because it pays well and there is a good team. The only problem I have with Polo is that to be a full time worker you have to have 100% availability so even though I only have school twice a week I can't be a full time employee, other than that I think Polo is a great place to be at."
good,"Ho lavorato in azienda per dieci anni. Periodo importante, determinante per la mia formazione. Ho imparato a vivere nel lusso, a gestire clienti di ogni genere, a soddisfare tutte le loro richieste per raggiungere i miei obbiettivi.

good,"Great job for someone who is looking for a fast-paced job. All in all, my only reason for wanting to leave is that it does not fit my personal wants. I love being outdoors and on a farm."
good,It was a very fun place to work yet it taught me how to talk with people. It taught how to deal with different types of people and how to sell merchandise.
good,I worked there for seasonal and the discounts weren’t all that great but the workers were great and the helped me with any questions I had through the tome I worked there
good,It was good working here while in school. I would recommend working here for a full time job. It gets very stressful because management is POOR. This job shouldn't be stressful but with me working there for couple of years I wanted out. The discounts is all everyone wanted!!!
good,"Although I wasn't crazy about all of the managers, I like how they always gave us incentives to earn some nice Ralph Lauren clothes. It made things fun, since we were working for a goal. I loved my co-workers. If you want to do this temp job, be ready to work with mostly actors."

The managers were very helpful in keeping the customer's and employee's needs satisfied.  I worked with people that knew the meaning of teamwork.  Although we would get the occasional customer that could be unbearable, still, we managed to send them off a happy customer.  The most enjoyable part of my job was putting the store back together again at the end of the day."
good,"Company benefits OK;"
good,"I just wish that Ralph Lauren would pay their employees that are temporary a little more. Because that could get more people to stay, and live a little more comfortable than they do."
good,I was lucky to have amazing opportunities and mentors over my time at RL. 
good,"Ralph Lauren is a great company that knows what they are doing. They are large and a high demand work place so they can afford to be a little light on the pay scale. "

good,Polo Ralph Lauren was a great fast paced job and kept employee's up to date with changes in the store and new shipments. Hours were very thought out for employee's.

good,"Amazing company to work for enjoy everyday at work , get sent to London frequently for training and conferences with other employees from the uk and Ireland."
good,"Ralph Lauren is an excellent company to work for unfortunately not much room to move outside of North Carolina, the pay could also be better since most warehouses do start off more for entry level jobs.

Overall the company has vary stable entry level jobs, relaxed and friendly management,  and various programs to help in your carrier advancement within the company if that is your desire."

good,"It was a great environment with okay management. The best part was discounts on nice clothes. In the end it is just a retail job, but I think the discounts were worth it"
good,"I worked at this location for one year and four months and learned a number of things. The main this is that hard working employees in retail can be hard to come by. Most regular employees were high school and college aged people so this was not too surprising. Management there was fair. Only time things were not great was around holiday periods, but that is to be expected."
good,It started off as a holiday job and they decided to give me an offer after. I loved my managers; they understood I was a college student and took that into consideration when making the schedule. we were a family working their and I appreciated every one of them.

Management was great. Keeping up with the dress code was never a problem for me. There was never a time that i felt as thought my work was too overwhelming for me.
good,"Working for ralph lauren, depending on your location, its consistently fast pace. I learned a lot of things, but there isnt much growth in the company as thus there isnt that much internal hiring. leadership team is always found from the outside thus how I found this job. There are lot of projects but you can always be in tuned with your creativity when it comes to visual merchandising"
good,"A typical day at the R&D involved experimenting with new chemicals and procedures that either chemical companies or designers wanted to try out. Towards the end we where experimenting with ways to be more economical by using special machines designed specifically for using less resources. I was fortunate enough to get into Ralph Lauren through networking and I learned many things while I was there. A few things I learned there were chemical handling and how to read the updated MSD (I believe is what they're called now) sheets along with different wet processes, including color matching on various fabrics, and a few dry processes that where conducted in the R&D. I also learned how to operate the various wash equipment and lab equipment such as spectrophotometers and roach machines. I couldn't have asked for better coworkers and management at the R&D. They where always friendly and willing to help teach me more about the industry when asked. The hardest part of the job, I'd have to say, would be trying to please the designers. A lot of the time they would ask for things that we simply couldn't do, but we would try our best and I enjoyed working with them regardless. What I enjoyed most about the job was the experimenting and how there was something different everyday."
good,crazy busy interesting people good co workers great clothes awesome management staff  loved working there loved the clothes

good,Worked for the company for over five years and learned a tremendous amount about this business especially merchandising. Build a lot of great relationships and took full advantage of the generous discount. I would honestly still be an employee if the new company I work for didn't enforce a conflict of interest between competing companies.
good,"A normal day at work, would start usually start around 5:00 a.m, depending on how much was in the building. We would clock in and straight to our meeting area. My department was Inventory Control. What we do is make sure every item in each box matched the UPC and number on the outside of the box. My manager as well as coworkers were very close, most of us had a relationship outside of work."

good,My experience at Ralph Lauren was hands on and full of high energy. I've learned about all the products and how to successfully handle customers. My management was very helpful with all of the employees. The hardest part was doing floor models. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing sales go up during customer purchases.

good,I feel I am treated well in the work places. My typical day starts with speaking to my director and teammates about the tasks needing to be complete overseas. The team I am on has very good managment. My coworkers are wonderful and work well with others. The most challenging part of the job is trying to get information from overseas vendors when they are not compliant and we are also riding on production timelines. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a team which appreciates my work and also working with the Italian office as its great working with people from a different country and culture.
good,"I get to stay here a lot through work - and it is definitely a big perk. Whether I'm there for a day or a month I always experience the same high standards from the staff. Nothing is ever too much trouble and they take great time in getting to know you and your preferences, making your work more comfortable. Its never like I have joined a new company, it was like as if I know everyone from ages. The most enjoyable part of the job to come to office everyday!"

Managers were very helpful and insightful in teaching the skills needed to function daily. My fellow co-workers were pleasant and through work built strong connections that helped in the work place. To describe the most difficult part of my job that would be trying to keep the store in order while speaking to every customer who entered the store, it could be hectic at times and a lot for one person to handle. The most enjoyable part of my time at the company would stem from the individuals I met each and everyday, the thing with customer service is you build a rapport with the customers and I find it exciting to learn about people, to go beyond the small talk and get to know who is buying your company products."

good,its a nice experience and great learning opportunity. Met different people
good,"Keeps you on your toes but in a fun environment, sales tactics is a must sale sale sale."
good,"I would come in and get greeted by my managers , supervisors and coworkers. If I arrived early before my shift started I wait in the break room or clock in if a manager approved, we have our beginning announcements and sales goals. Then we would be placed in our ""zones"" whatever part of the store we would be working at and get too work. The hardest part off the job would definitely be the language barriers since we would have international customers so communicating with them was a challenge if they didn't speak english but we would find our way around it."

good,Really good company to work for. Awesome discounts. Only thing that I did not really like was the dress code but that was never really a big deal. Overall really enjoyed working there.
good,"Most of my managers were fair individuals however as in all workplaces there were some bad ones with ego complexes. It’s definitely a step up from your more accessible brands like Express, a&f that sort of deal. This being said the customers are more demanding in general.  I say this from experience in other retail workplaces. Compensation is better than average.. you could move up the ladder if u have some prior experience and if a few spots were to open up. Overall it’s a good company that has become more “Corporate” because of the looming internet competition.  The days of a chill summer job in a store are pretty much over.... they will get on you to sell products"
good,"Dealing with all the customer,being able to solve customers needs.The managers are great.My coworkers are helpful,folding clothing was hard sometimes.The company dinners"

The Managers are friendly and understanding, and overall are great to work with."
good,A typical day at Polo would be packed with hundreds of customers. Learned to communicate with different types of people and taught how to be a leader. I was the youngest sales associate there at that time. Very lenient with all customers. Management always wanted us to push for sales. Everyday we would exceed last years goal and the current daily goal given. Hardest part would be how hectic it was. Felt like long days. Most enjoyable was my team and at the end of the day we all were one huge family.

If you're looking to be challenged and have a long term career, Ralph Lauren is definitely a company to look into!"
good,"Your typical day at this job was just like any other job, you had to be ready to work. You had to break out of your bubble and give the costumers the help they need. I learned quite a bit working here; ranging from learning how to deal with upset costumers to just dealing with costumers in general and giving them a feel good environment when they walked through the doors. I also learned how to operate the cash registers and also learned how to close them at the end of the night and make the deposits. The co-workers I had were awesome. Most of them are my age and in college as well. Encouraging team as well as a making the experience all worth while. The hardest part of the job was trying to help costumers that didn't speak english very well. Another challenging part for me was learning how to close the cash registers. I enjoyed just about every experience at Polo. My favorite thing to do was create a positive connection with a costumer. I wanted to make sure they were happy while I am ringing them out because as my manager always said, ""You are the last people to interact with our costumers and you can have the chance to either make the costumer leave the store satisfied and come back often, or you can make the costumer unhappy and be the reason for them to not come back."" That always stuck with me because the more I thought about, the more it made sense to me. Making people happy and satisfied with their visit to Polo Ralph Lauren is what I enjoyed. Another enjoyable part of the job is getting the chance to meet people from all over the world. Not very often you get to interact"
good,"A typical day for me wold be working at the cash wrap. I would ring up customers and ensure they found everything alright. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with difficult customers. They would either ask you for things that you could not do or there were a lot of instances where there was a language barrier.

I enjoy coming to work greeting associates and co-workers on a daily its a family orientated environment with people of all nationalities and cultures. The hardest part of my job has to be the fact that it becomes routine and less challenging the only thing i can do from there is move forward into a new role in leadership to gain added responsibility. Most enjoyable part is being able to be apart of the events committee which specializes in community outreach programs as well as employee appreciation. Its exciting to see the impact we make on the faces of the youth, community partners, and our associates at Ralph Lauren."

good,"Everyday I was at work, my task changed. One day I will be in the back reorganizing stock and the next I will be reorganizing the floor. Although my tasks changed frequently, the managers did that based on who was working and what their strengths were. Everyday was fast paced and even though the store may be empty, there was never a lack of work. The hardest part of the job was dealing with foreign customers. The easiest part of the job was working with clothing."
good,Management was very well trained and made it seem like work wasn't work. Always had positive vibes with all my coworkers. The company always took care of its employees with great benefits.

Growth is very essential here, the management team work collectively to help one another with specific tasks that need to get accomplish weekly. We have alot of high school and college students employed which makes it difficult for me to create an ideal schedule weekly due to availability issues. The hardest part about my job is dealing with suspected shop lifters. The most enjoyable part of the job is the connecting with satisfying customers and training and developing associates. The day is typical busy with a lot going on as well with alot of tasks to get accomplished, I tried to map out my day according to importance to get completed what need to be completed.

good,"workday was very enjoyable "
good,this is a hard place to work and it is a very fun place to work but i need a better balance between school and work. if i wa a high school student than this is a good place otherwise its not.
good,"The job is not bad however, you will witness how little sympathy consumers have for retail workers. You don't have to wear Polo but you will end up becoming a mannequin because your discount is enticing as well as you if you don't come in with dress clothes you can enhance your wardrobe as well persuade consumers of the brand. You do not want to close the store. Smh. You might be scheduled till 10 and may not leave until the managers discretion and the appearance of the store. No benefit, no job advancement, and the managers they usually are stressed to hit the numbers. Overall, cool job. Your communication and customer service skills have potential to go through the roof."

Outside of my role as a supervisor, I got to be a model for customers who want to see how things fit on an actual person. I love to go the extra mile to help customers so I never mind when asked to try on things. Trying and developing crew members is an everyday task and I find it rewarding. The job became very natural for me because I’m used to helping and serviceing the people. The only thing that was hard in this job, was leaving due to relocating out of state.

good,I love my managers in the children's division. They are wonderful and the work environment is great. I would recommend as a first job into the luxury industry for anyone.
good,Working as a cash lead as many responsibilities. We open and close the registers. We are kind of like managers just without the title. We train any new cashiers that are coming in on their first day. We please the customers if something isn't going correctly the best way we can. If we don't have something they're looking for we try to see if we can order it for them for the next best option. We have to make sure the other cashiers know what they're doing because it can be stressful at moments especially during the weekends/ holidays. I've been there for many years and am well rounded and one of there top sellers and can work any department there. I'm ready for new challenges and new things to learn.
good,Excellent Clothing designer.  Quality brand. I love the clothes that we sell.  Customers trust my opinion and ideas with choices in garments.This brand and designer is traditional and forever worth wearing.
good,A great place to work.  The highest of standards are promoted in an inclusive and mentored environment.  This is a great place to build relationships and gain perspective on the rapidly changing retail environment.
good,"Challenging environment, good management for most of the time.  Did not withhold funding for projects o IT upgrades.  Sr. Management was great to work with / for."
good,I only worked for Polo Ralph Lauren Services temporarily but they treated me well. Dress code was comfortable wasn't too much restrictions. I love that at the Beechwood location they provided cafeteria food for you to order off of. I probably would have liked for them to have some type of discount or a little cheaper since we are their employee's. The hours was promised and sometimes over time and they never gave you a job that was too hard.
good,This is a great company to work for as a temporary position. The entire experience depends on the management. Pay is not fair for experience and seniority.
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,Great place to work at. The management is wonderful but no job security. Currently looking for another job because the company is laying off all IT and will be outsourcing the IT.
good,"In my 13yr tenure at Ralph Lauren I meet a lot of people ceo's, presidents, and managers. All whom I have took great information from. Ralph Lauren will always have a spot in my heart as one of the best jobs I have had."
good,this job is seriously one of my favorite jobs i've ever had! the company is great unfortunately it was only a seasonal job and didn't have any permanent job space. Supervisors are seriously great!
good,"As I worked Fridays and weekends for 8 hours a day, those timeslots were extremely busy, especially in the evenings. My supervisor on the floor was extremely helpful and the tasks for the day were communicated clearly. I have learned from my supervisor how to deal with unsatisfied customers in a polite and professional manner, so they are happy with final negotiated outcome. "
good,"My day would start off with me helping customers find what they needed to buy. If I was not helping customers, I was folding clothes and keep the shelves stocked. "
good,this was a offsite where we prossesed all incomming shippments that was send from corp. we D-tag the close and transfer everything to the store for the sales floor.
good,"Many different business functions, never a dull day.  Some of the staff appear to work hard and others don't show that same charactaristic."
good,everyone at polo seems to be really friendly including management. management is also very helpful and willing to do whatever they can to help out
good,"A typical day at PRL includes giving exceptional customer service and dealing well with problems.  I have learned not to take things said from people personally just because they are in a bad mood.  Management is great and very understanding of what people can and cannot do, or what they want and do not want to do, and if you need time off they are willing to accommodate you.  The hardest part of my job would be overnight shifts for floor sets, and some of the stress from dealing with multiple things going on at once.  My favorite part about this job is meeting new people and helping them find what they are looking for and making the customer happy, and working with a great team."
good,"A typical day at Polo was a 5am shift that began with a truck run, which brought new merchandise to our store that my team & I were to unwrap, fold, hang & then store in back or place to be put out on floor. I was able to to learn much while working for this company. Mainly about people & how to make a customers experience more enjoyable as well as raising the sales. There wasn't a hard part of the job, but the enjoyable part was being able to help your customers find clothes that made them feel good."
good,"Going into work, clocking in, getting instructions from Management as to what area i best fit at the moment."
good,The learning never stops at Ralph and you are challenged everyday. Opportunity is there if you work hard and skills are recognized and built upon.
good,In this job i learned all abour close sales and customer services.
good,"This was my 1st job ever and I loved working here. The associates, the management, and the customer were really great."
good,Every day provides a new experience. I held 3 different positions at Polo Ralph Lauren and each allowed me an opportunity to grow and advance. The most challenging part of the job is the schedule change for floor sets as it requires 2-3 overnights per floor set. Floor sets come monthly. The work culture is good to great depending on the General Manager at the time. I've experienced both ends of the spectrum.
good,Working as a lifeguard has taught me multiple things. Taught me how to save lives and help those who may not know how to swim. It was a short experience working there but I learned a lot.
good,Good company great people and in a good town low crime would recommend this place to anyone who wants a good job with it good people and easy to work with

good,I enjoyed my time at the company. People were nice and helpful. My manager seemed to care and was informative. I would go back if i'm needed and asked.
good,"It was really busy on the weekends, but during the day it was really slow. I didn't really learn anything since Ralph Lauren is like my fifth job. The managers were really cool, but they also knew how to get their work done. The job wasn't hard at all because I know how to interact with customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is to see the new shipment of clothing that is coming to the store."
good,It is a great place to work. Sometimes the uncertain knowledge of layoffs scares associates. Great people and awesome benefits. There were a good amount of vacation pay. The health insurance was great.

good,Polo Ralph Lauren was a great start up point for me as an employee because not only was my first job but is where i learned my work ethic. With Polo Ralph Lauren is a very competitive environment that if you're willing to thrive and become the best you can your work won't be shunned. In less than a year I became the cash lead overviewing the cash registers of this great quality retail brand. Due to the stress and the situation one confronts you learn how to problem solve and customer service at a point that you know whoever you attend will end up pleased and more than welcome to come back.

good,I am very proud to have worked at RL for 9 years. It was a healthy balance of competition and collegial environment/culture. I was challenged every day.
good,"I loved, loved, loved working for Ralph Lauren. The discounts were great, the team I worked with was great, managers were great. The hardest part were having to work various hours. Retail is very demanding and therefore various hours are required to be worked. Typically the beginning of a shift would consist of facing the store, and the remaining of a day would be restocking, customer service, and cash handling. I was rewarded for my exceptional knowledge of the store policies. The store's score was failing until I came in and made a difference. I left Polo for a better opportunity.I gave notice and resigned."

good,"Ralph Lauren employees the most talented designers in the world and consistently produces beautiful clothing lines for men, women, children and home."
good,I'd go to work in the morning and get my assignment for the day and go about my business. If i finished early i would pick up an extra assignment and cruise through that until my day was over.
good,It was interesting working for Polo RL. I learned many things and I feel grateful for everything I learned and for all the excellent people I met.

good,"Polo Ralph Lauren was always a fun,exciting environment for me. I met literally all kinds of people from all walks of life across the world. Typical day would include greeting the customer, assisting as needed while mainting a courteous, friendly attitude. Also occasionally folding merchandise, prep work, cash register duty; basically making and securing the costumer can identify and purchase with little to no difficulties. Management was great! Co-workers were great! Hardest part of the job would be the traffic and constant moving on your feet. "

The typical day isn't busy, however the weekends and holidays can turn the store into a frenzy Overall it's a great side job or first job. I do not recommend staying there too long if this is your sole form of income because advancement is there but normally only 1 position is available."
good,Arriving at work @ 6 am have dept meeting then start working processing orders for shipment to retail stores in various parts of the country. Take breaks and lunch. Have fun with co workers learning new things all the time. Was a great place to work.

good,"Typically, I would come in and my manager would give me the goal of the day, the mission, and what I would be doing. I learned a lot about time management especially during the holidays when I worked 40 hours a week and was going to school full time. The management was amazing, very understanding and willing to work with my student schedule. They understood that we are all human and sometimes need a break. Workplace culture was like a home, absolutely the best job I have ever had. The hardest part of the job was the scheduling, we were short staffed most times.

Management gives fair and true answers to questions from employees. Company gives good breaks and lunch hours to employees with care and understanding. Employees are team players who help each other to succeed with co-training and respect.

In such a luxury brand day to day varied as some days it was very quiet but this gave us a great opportunity to have one to one with our clients.

good,An atmosphere that people enjoy being around. The management is understandable and also on your case for good reason. Its not really a job its a lifestyle. I have learned multiple varieties of styles and clothing. Hardest part of the day is cleaning up behind customers but the enjoyable part is using your knowledge of fashion to help someone else embark on swagger.
good,"I have learn when you are very well liked on your  job by employees as well as the manager, always try to maintain that relationship well, and improve yourself to be that dependable person they are looking for, I have learned managers are looking for employees that doesn't mind taking on extra task to prove they can do more than just one job. The hardest part of the job is keeping yourself busy when the business is slow. The most important part I love is making my customer's happy."
good,"Great co-workers, great company if you are more comfortable working in a corporate environment. Very clean cut and straight forward work. Management is very straight forward, and everyone is very hierarchial in terms of problems getting solved. The hardest part of the job is learning on the job. You may have to teach yourself a bit of the lingo, but once you get the hang of the way the company works and how your co-workers handle situations you will be fine.

MY co-workers are great people to be around both professionally and personally. The hardest part of my job would be having to deal with the different personalities and attitudes that come with working with tons of people, although is stressful at times, it has taught me how to deal with different people and handle complex situations. The best part of my day would be working on new projects that I have more input on; this makes me feel like part of a team.independanetly"

good,"I had a great experience being a seasonal employee at Ralph Lauren. I got to develop more of my communication skills greeting customers, helping customers, and being a team with other employees."
good,"a typical day would be a busy day where we have a lot of customers where I learned that's when we have to be the most cautious because we have secret shoppers. Management is always on point with letting us know our daily goal and how to better work as a team in our workplace culture. The hardest part of the job would be starting as a beginner on the floor. When its your first day on the job and the store is packed, you will have customers ask you questions that you will not quite have the answers to just yet. On the other hand, the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help the customers and actually interact with them as human beings than just a sales rep."
good,"One of the best brands to work for, every creative is given complete freedom to explore and grow.  I learned a lot about business and product development."

good,I really enjoyed my time. Really nice place to work. The management team is really fair and work with you schedules. Clean and very organized. I thank them for giving me a chance.
good,"I had an awesome group of employees willing to do anything in a team endeavor to make our store amazing.  When our product would change from time-to-time, sales associates would step up to send out the 50,000+ items to the distribution center...only  to await the arrival of new product and would systematically replace it in our store.  Awesome!!"
good,"I enjoyed working at polo Ralph Lauren for the time I did! I had no complaints other than a young, new, and a bit unfit manager who tended to be a little lost, confused, and in need of help when working!"
good,I worked for Polo Ralph Lauren for a short period of time but the time I was there I enjoyed working had great team leaders and good staff people that made it easy to come to work everyday
good,"Great place to work! "
good,Polo Ralph Lauren is a great company to work for and has been very well to me. The advancement opportunities are limitless and there are plenty of stores across the world you are able to relocate to. I have learned so much from Ralph Lauren. My key take away Ralph Lauren has taught me is how to be an entrepreneur of the business. I am very fluent at driving the business globally thanks to Ralph Lauren. The thing I enjoy most about the job is the volume. We get to meet so many great people daily and there is always something to do.
good,My experience with Polo was surprisingly very family like. I worked in two different location and the same could be said for both; the people took pride in their performance and were always very welcoming and friendly.
good,I very much enjoyed working at this company. The management was almost entirely exceptional and always working hard. My coworkers made it a very easy going and productive work environment.
good,"Colleagues comes from different countries and culture, it develops my very good communication and comprehensive skills."
good,"I loved working here and was hoping to get hired on full time."
good,"Very professional , dedicated staff.  Charming , elegant surroundings in which to work.  Lovely working with editors on well known magazines.."
good,"A typical day would be opening the store and making sure every item on the floor was perfect. From how many items were on each display, making sure all sizes were out, checking the stock in the back to see if we could add more product to the floor. When the doors open you greet each customer with a smile. You walk around making sure to engage every customer and ask if they need assistance or to recommend additional products to match what they already have in their bag. You might also assist customers in the fitting rooms, be a cashier, greeter, stocker and all while managing the other employees on the floor. This was a terrific place to work and always kept me motivated to be my best."
good,"Questa esperienza mi ha insegnato a"
good,"Fácil comunicación con las encargadas directas."
good,"meeting new people everyday, helping customers find exactly what they were looking for, and being part of the ralph lauren team."
good,A typical day at Polo was fun. Each time you come in for a shift there is a video that we would have to watch to learn more about the brand. Management was on top of their shifts and made sure all the employees were stationed at their appropriate places. All the employees got along real good with great vibes The hardest part of the job was getting customers to open up and step out their comfort zone.
good,"Company thrives on internal and external customer satisfaction. Co-workers and managers, alike, are eager to help and continue to learn and expand. Team work between all is encouraged. Internal advancement is not only available, but encouraged and supported. Everyday is a little different and exciting, as all customer service and sales positions are. Office work (payroll, scheduling, interviews and orientations) completed before opening. After opening, the number 1 focus is the customer. They truly care about every single customer and ensuring a positive experience."
good,Pay is very good; ample overtime opportunities.  very fast paced environment. Great co-workers and management is very down to earth
good,"I loved it, they were flexible with my schedule and I felt welcomed as I started there. I didn't like how the assignment ends so quickly but when I was there I enjoyed it."
good,"best job i ever had, even though it doesnt pay much i met a lot of celebrities working concerts"
good,"Work at Ralph Lauren Polo began by dropping off your stuff in the office and reporting to the floor. Compared to working at Torin Jacks this atmosphere was more loose and self governed. My duties on the floor were to maintain store tidiness, greet customers as they come in, assist any customer with their questions or sales, and also unlike Torin Jacks, keep track  of my own lunch and break time. While at this job, I almost never saw my coworkers as just people that i work with but as my brothers and sisters. Interacting with people is one of my strongest qualities which is important for working here. This made it so everyone knew eachother personally. It was then that I learned how working as family not only as a unit boosts productivity exponentially."
good,I got to have a lot of job experience here and worked with amazing coworkers.
good,"The people are super interactive, great crew members, managers are very thoughtful and always keep the customers and workers in mind. "

good,"I come into work, clock in and can be at least five minutes late. The work enviroment is postive and the company itself is a joy to work for. I love the people I work with, they are enjoyable and postive. The challenging part of my day is at the end when we close and recover the product. The most enjoyable part of my day is working with customers and co-workers."
good,"Most of your day is facilitating customer, and when the store is closed, then your aiding in recovering the store. This company taught me excellent customer service, and patience with people. Management is great, fair, and understanding; as long as you're prodctive."
good,EN Polo ralph Lauren eh Adquirido una experiencia mas completa en cuanto al trabajo administrativo que se realiza en el sector de caja en cualquier marca.

good,"This is a great company to work for! The people and customers are amazing just like the clothes. The product is a little complicated, but with a great sale associate its no problem. Over the past two years, I have learned if you want something do, then do it yourself, timing, perfect/board folding, and most importantly how to sell the product. The most enjoyable part of this job would have to be making customers happy by providing them with excellent customer service."
good,A good job for a teenager to have bc of the minimum hours but a overall good job with a great team
good,All the managers in the building are great and help you out a ton.  Advancement is possible.  in my location we get access to upper level executives all the time.
good,"Loved it.  Great company and opportunty.  would love to work there again"
good,"To be completely honest, I love my job and the brand. It’s perfect but retail can be stressful. If you don’t like long hours, chaotic sales weekends and tight deadlines it’s not for you but I would say if you’re willing to learn, be a team player and have a taste for the world of fashion and the heritage of quality clothing then Ralph is for you"
good,"Ralph Lauren is the absolute best company to work for and if I didn’t have to move to an area where the closest Ralph Lauren is over an hour away, I would have loved to continued my employment with them. The company is so inclusive and so caring about their employees and their happiness, and offer endless opportunities for advancement and growth within the company. I would work there for the rest of my time if I could"
good,My favorite thing about  Polo is the communication between managers and sales associates was awesome. The work environment was very structured. All zones in the store were covered. A very clean was well maintained store.

good,I’m a new manager and the interview process was so reassuring and I didn’t feel strung along like most companies.  Great communication throughout the entire process. I’m looking forward to my future career with Ralph Lauren.
good,"I loved working at Ralph Lauren, Due to school i wasn't able to keep a job and go through extra school as i did. I was the cashier at the front of the store, i stocked merch."
good,"It was an interesting but fun experience. I was surrounded by a wonderful staff, however in the realm of retail in general it lacks true job security."
good,"as inventory control, cycle counting inventory, updating balance,fixing variances, sorting damage,suport picking and backing departments, and customer service as needed."
good,A typical day started with a pep talk from the manager on duty on that day. I learned how to manage time between projects and customer service. Management was great in motivating the team to do better everyday and teaching us new things on how to promote and up sell. The hardest part of the job was trying to manage time between customers while going to the back of house to look for some products possibly not on the sales floor.  The most enjoyable part of the day was working with the sales team and management team. Also helping customers find the right product for the right occasion.
good,Polo Ralph Lauren is and easy job to work at no matter what your job is. I learned that they make more than just clothing apparel. With the items that they make they are sure to be around forever as long as people need. There is nothing hard about working here at all.

While I was there I learned extensive knowledge on wet processing and color matching along with chemical handling and safety. During my employment management was possibly the best management I had the pleasure of experiencing."
good,"A  typical day at Ralph, I had to be a cashier and also work the floor. I learned how to multi task efficiently and fold clothes properly. I also learned customer and retail skills. Our managers at Ralph were friendly and taught me how to use the cash register. My co-workers were my main mentors because managers taught certain employees how to train new employees. The hardest part of the job was working overnight shifts from 8 pm to 5 am. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning about the retail world and all there is to know to run a successful business."

good,Working wasn't to bad like any retail it was fast busy and crazy but there wasn't much to learn daily also the management was not good! They sat in the back all day long. Co-workers were amazing people to talk to and make life long friends. The hardest part of working was the pace but you get use to it and the most enjoyable part would be dressing to your personality each day you worked.
good,Great store to work for good team environment and great management. Learned Human Resources and Operation there and advanced very quickly for part-time sales to full-time management. Hardest part of job was to have to take deal with associated incidents. Easiest was opening stores in the New England Area. Really loved working for this company.

good,I been working for Polo for about 5 to 6 mouths and its been very rewarding. I got to meet new people and learn new things like how to help customer and to promote sale's. Some of my co-workers are just so awesome we have all really became great friends including are managers. I believed the hardest thing for me has been promoting sale's and suggesting items which is very weird because I am a designer and I should be good at suggesting items. The most enjoyable part of my job would have to be break time where I can just sit back and chill.
good,I have worked in the field as an Assistant Manager and General Manager. It's a fast pace environment and the the people are so dedicated to the brand. The most enjoyable part of the job is training new employees around product knowledge and Ralph Lauren's vision.
good,"A typical day at Ralph Lauren as a sales associate is pretty hectic. There are customers swarming in from left to right, so in between keeping the work area clean and being there for customers' questions or concerns, you may be a little overwhelmed. I learned how to be patient and have a positive attitude towards work. Management was great. They were friends with us, but made sure they were our boss first. Co-workers basically worked in their own area, but when help was needed, they helped. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep the work space clean, since there were so many customers at one. I have to admit the most enjoyable part of my job was helping a customer fufill their need and wants."
good,"Typical day is interacting with customers and providing best in class customer service. Management was excellent, I learned a lot from them and they helped me mature as a manager. I built a lot of relationships with internal and external customers which was an enjoyment of the job."

good,I worked at Ralph lauren through out highschool and it was a very pleasant experience. I enjoyed coming to work and learning more and more about our products to be a better sales person while at Ralph Lauren.

Overall a great company to work with.

good,-hectic but I love to keep busy!
good,"Making sure you know what you have in front for the day. Walk the store so you know what needs to be done on the floor before we open up.  Knowing what your goals are and  putting a plan in place to make those goals. Checking you mail and touching base with your managers, DM or regional. Making sure that when you open you have what the customers are looking for and if not have the resources to make it happen for them. The most important  thing about this job is making your customers happy and seeing that repeat customer and they will tell someone else about their experience at your store.This company care about you and your family. The benefits are excellent and they give back to the community. The company have contest to make the job fun and they  always giving something. The floor sets are fun because we get to see the new merchandise before the customer and its overnight and we enjoy placing it on the floor for the customers. Knowing that you made your Goals at the end of the night is so much fun because on conference you get to speak to everyone in your district about what you did to make your goal. On conference calls you get ideals from other stores on what you can do to make your goals or get ready for inventory or whatever.  The support system with this company is AWESOME!!!"
good,Good place to work.  Hours were cut due to season ending.  Good benefits. Customers can be difficult at times but you have to know how to handle an irritated customer with good customer service and a smile.  Benefits are good.  Many different perks to the job.

good,"I really enjoyed being able to work management roles when i first started as a sales associate. My managers were willing to teach me and they talked to higher management to give more opportunities for their employees.

good,"- Stock floors, help customers, work cash register, build manikin, keeping up the back stock."
good,Great Place to work! Great people. Coworkers are always open to answering questions for newbies. I don't really have any complaints except the training could be longer than a week. Training is kind of rushed.
good,"I worked for Ralph Lauren when I was in High School so I did not have much room to move up. However the corporate branding manager came out to the Castle Rock location to take store photos, he noticed my meticulous folding and said it was some of the best he had ever seen. He had the company pay me to stay overnight and brand the entire store, the largest location in Colorado. I was told many times I could be in management had It not been for my age at the time. My managers were caring and fun, I truly loved everything about the job and will always look back at my time there fondly."

Each type of clothing has a location for placing the tags and they have to be placed accordingly be consistent. However sometimes clothes pile up at the table where we have to place the clothes and eventually it all piles up."
good,"Its was a great outgoing to work with a group of people, we did mix SKU, weight and cude, sorting, an labeling  an also we had to receive the trucks that comes everyday"
good,"I would attend photoshoots on a weekly basis all over the Northeast region of the US working on women's, men's, and children's photoshoots.  Before that, I would help cast the models and perform style-outs to prepare.  My bosses were incredibly informative, patient, and energetic- making it more of an inclusive learning experience as well as taking my opinion into consideration.  I loved every second of it."
good,Best company I have ever worked for. The atmosphere demands the best of you. I enjoyed meeting the leaders of the business and had a new found appreciation for fashion and the hard work that goes into it.

good,I enjoyed working there but management was not as great. Customers were always your main priority. Being flexible and available was a must. The pay was good and so were the hours.
good,"I appreciate what I do at my job. There's much learn, I get along great with my team of co-workers as well as management. All about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop also. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company.There are difficulties some days with maintaining physical consistancy due to the repetitive body motions required for job. However, there's just something awesome about returning home safely from a well accomplished day on the job."
good,"Working sales and customer service for this company was absolutely amazing. It was one of my first customer service jobs and left a great impression on me. Work days were average 9-5 shifts, I worked as a cashier, sales associate, restocking, and cleaning when we closed. The co-workers there were respectful, fun, amazing people I never once had a problem with anyone else who worked at that location. I since then have come into contact with the same person who was my manager at this location and still received kindness and she still remembered me even though it had been years since i had worked with her."

I would lead the operation line and maintain a fast pace to ensure that all of the product would be processed correctly and in a timely manner. I've learned that it is important go ask for feedback in order to better myself. All of my co-workers were extremely friendly and motivated one another to exceed expectations. The toughest part of being a stock associate for Ralph Lauren was making having to back-stock all of the Men's product in a short period of time to guarantee that there would be no carryover at the end of my shift.

good,"My daily routine was to help customers find what they're looking for. I learned how to communicate properly and how the managers worked the floor layout.

I learned a new level of exceeding customer service, how to distribute items to other countries and how DCC currency works.

My co-workers and I developed a very strong bond as figures proved on a day to day basis that our team work showed strong figures as well as incredibly customer feedback reports. The hardest part of my job was learning how to do technical tasks such as dispatching orders to different countries, hotels, homes, specific taxis etc. However, after a few mistakes and practices' it became quite a simple task. The most enjoyable part of my job would be seeing how well customers react to a high level of customer service, they was able to see the effort I would put into serving them and it showed by their kindness in return."

The management was awesome we were all good friends. Hardest part of the job was having to make unhappy people happy. There are some people who come in and all they want to do is make things difficult for you and have no remorse whatsoever howerver, it is our job so we handle it.

A typical day at work involved marketing merchandise, informing customers of sales and other store-related information, completing purchases with customers, keeping the store presentable and easy to maneuver about, and interacting with coworkers and managers. From this experience, I've learned that just one person can make a difference for a whole company and everyone is just as important as the next. I had a great experience because my managers were friendly and nice to work under. My coworkers were supportive and we all worked together as a team because that is what a business is about. The hardest part was not being able to do anything if there was ever a theft. Most of the time when the store's alarm went off it was just because an employee forgot to take off a sensor. However, there were a couple times where customers would attempt to steal items and we, as employees, were told we could not really do anything to prevent it. We cannot assume or question anyone. On the other hand, the most enjoyable part was getting to learn about the company and be a part of it. I enjoyed working for a big name retail brand."

good,Working at Ralph Lauren was a good experience in my life they gave me the opportunity to grow
good,"A typical day at work included punching in and a daily meeting. The managers would let you know the sales goal for the day and what area you were in charge of. In your area, the objective was to keep it clean at all times and if customers walked in you greeted them offered them your help. You would switch areas through out the day and by the end of your shift you let your co-worker who was going to replace you know of any projects you were working on. In Polo Ralph Lauren I learned how to handle a diversity of situations. Each and every individual that walked in would have different concerns and it was your job to try and solve it in the most professional way possible. I also learned to time management as sometimes we would  have a time limit to our projects but most importantly I learned the importance of excellent customer service. Management and my co-workers were definitely the easiest part of my job. Management made the work place exciting and fun and my co-workers also cooperated with that. The hardest part of the job I would say was mainly understanding some of the concerns customers had. As a well known shopping center there were a variety of people who would walk in and not know any English whatsoever, we had to try and figure out what they wanted and deliver it to them professionally. As I said before the most enjoyable part of the job was to come into your job feeling content and looking forward to an exciting day with your managers and coo-workers."
