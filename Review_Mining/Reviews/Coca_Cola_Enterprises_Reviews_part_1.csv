bad,"I was injured at work and had to have major surgery. Coca- Cola has never check on me, they just let me go. I'm still going back, to have more surgery after being injured on the job."
bad,"When I started a this job it was one of the best work but the Union killed everything they froze the salary for five years new contract. Poor management, the equipment maintenance bad, old truck   Stay away from this job not good"
bad,"Tight little crews that talk behind your back and are very unhelpful and snigger at new people for not knowing certain things,if you don't like authority this isn't the place for you as supervisors will be hiding round corners to purposely pull you to the side and give you A *ss wuppin to show what great almighty power they THINK they have.full time drivers are lapdogs snitches and will kindly jingle your bells for a compliment or two but after being so wonderfull to you they don't mind dropping blame on agency staff for things not going perfect this makes the workplace, devided really. You have a array of wonderfull supervisors and shifts to choose from but you won't be able to tell one shift appart from another as they are all equally unpleasant. Don't expect compliments or respect from any of the supervisors and most of the office workers in fact. Office staff ooh and arrr about doing there job which makes you not want to inquire about things you don't know which then leaves you in an awkward situation.  "
bad,Be at work on time so you could wait four hours for your first load of the night to be loaded. I learned I would never work here again management was uncaring. The hardest part was actually showing up for work so I could just waste four hours of my life waiting for my load. The most enjoyable part of my job was the day I said goodbye!
bad,Extremely terrible place to work. The work atmosphere its self is extreme and the way management treat the employees on top of working in the extreme conditions is heartbreaking.
bad,overworked/no life the company wants you to break your back for them. they will pay you overtime but its not time and a half. its the more hours you work the more the pay drops.
bad,"brought on board and lied to about potential progression."
bad,"The company is going throught so many changes it is hard for anyone to enjoy working here.  However, there are many many wonderful people that work here."
bad,"Any company has problems, but I never has the experience to see a company that I can not do anything to improved just because management does not want to improved.  Not organized."
bad,"Dans le cadre de mon master j'ai du effectuer un stage et j'ai choisi Coca-Cola Entreprise. Cela peut faire joli sur un CV mais en lui même le stage a été très décevant car sans intérêt. "
bad,"They lie to you from day one about what you'll be making just to get you in the door so they can cover their summer. of course after the summer they might not even keep you on. Everyone in the beverage industry knows that summer time is when you make your money for the year, and all they did was take away my opportunity to make a decent paycheck. I ended up quitting halfway through August since they laid me off so many times that I had plenty of time to go job hunting. DO NOT waste your time with this company if you need to make a decent living."
bad,worst job ever management was'nt good did not know what to do or how to lead the fleet shop. people were not helpful or friendly would not give a helping hand. do not recommend to work for any one.
bad,"Clock in at 4am, clock out at 8pm.  16 hours a day 6 days a week and occasionally pick up a route on your only day off so someone can go bowling.  bust your a** all day, get yelled at by every store manager for stuff that's not your fault and get yelled at by your boss for getting yelled at.  Earned 2 bonuses and never received them and was fired for taking a vacation day."
bad,Upper management were very un-professional. Took advantage of their workers. I was a part-time worker but worked 50+ hours a week. If you werent available to work on your scheduled days off they would punish you by not scheduling you at all. WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND WORKING THERE!
bad,"If cou can stay away from this place, awful people, terrible managers, useless labour union "
bad,"Not a good company to work for, as a service member of the military coming back from a deployment they didn't help me transfer to a new area and had me do it myself and apply like any other person trying to get a job for coke that is not currently employed by them and had to find a job elsewhere because no positions were open and they didn't even try to put me into a position."
bad," Many people think that it is the greatest company to work for not so much,on too many levels. they were not respectful of any ideas put forward . used far many  p/t employees to avoid paying any benefits.. lied when promised hours and very disrespectful of any of the women that worked there."
bad,"If you want to be micromanaged, blamed for every mistake ever made, be in a cultlike environment who tells you who to vote for for President then this Job is for you. I broke out in a rash, had trouble sleeping, and my blood pressure went over the roof due to the horrible working conditions of this company. They treat you like you are on top of the world until you start working. After that it is a nightmare. Management is rude, inconstant and never around, then there are the favorites that get away with anything. I have never reviewed a job before but felt the need to do so after such a horrible experience. The job expectations are unrealistic but expected. After talking with HR, I received retribution which is against their policy but that didn't seem to matter .Everybody walks around wondering if today it the day they will get fired. Employees keep boxes under their desks so they can pack up there personal belongings in a moments notice. And forget being promoted unless you are one of the chosen ones or know someone higher up in the company. If you are considering applying or interviewing for a job, RUN, RUN, RUN and keep your sanity and dignity."
bad,"I don't know if it was just the Youngstown Ohio facility, but the merchandiser manager did not know how to do her job, Neither did our shop steward for the union. I would give Coca Cola another try just not at that location."
bad,"it sucked, no skills morales or compassion required from management"
bad,"Worked there as a temp and was told by my recruiter that it will turn into a permanent job placement. After working there for a couple of weeks, found out that they have the temps working there for 30 days then after your 30 days they have you take this test, that takes you at least 2 hours to take with questions that have nothing to do with the company nor the job and if you fail the test, then they fire you. But for someone who gets hired on without being a temp first, they don't have to take the test. Very screwed up!!!"
bad,Schedule 50 employees daily to meet the needs of the business.
bad,"St.Pete Coke,is terrible,they work you to death,they overload you with stores.I can tell you also,when you don't have a Phone,there starting pay stinks,and mileage payback.Your bosses never back you,account mgrs backstab you."
bad,"I applied to Coke numerous times and haven't got any replies. This tells me that they obviously do not care about their applicants, never the less, their employees. Of course, those that work at Coke, have to work there, since they are scared of making a move in fear that it might be detrimental to their future career goals. Who knows. Coke might be OK with their employees leaving for greener pastures."
bad,"In the (slow time) they go up and down the roster and lay driver's off usually three per day. When you get hired you will be a float so you will have to cover the routes for the people who are on vacation or call in sick. They don't train you on any route. You have to be able to just go with the flow. You never know what you are doing the next day. The management there is awful!! They usually have different things to say, they were never on the same page. There is no advancement you will be stuck doing every route there and it will take a year or more to get your own route. For a huge company the training is really really bad!! I was shocked how they treated their employees. Overall it was not a good fit for me at all. Hope this helps!!"
bad,Not a nice place to work managers step on employees to look good union is no good just takes employees money doesnt do anything if you file griveses
bad,"Deliver Coke product to customer vending and snack machines. Count, Load, and process orders for clients in the market field. Assist with any programming issues or down machines that may be needed at time of service. Order and manage truck product and inventory daily."
bad,Terrible Terrible place to work(Baltimore MD.) The management is a disgrace. They dare you to fail and make your life miserable when you can't live up to their unrealistic expectations.(Perfection) If you don't work 80 hour weeks you are considered lazy.. Stay away...... stay far far away.
bad,"Extremely long hours in the summertime, unorganized/clueless management, low wages/raises, people always call out or leave during a shift and you must make up for their absence. The turn over rate is ridiculous, and DONT GET HURT or they will put you on an indefinite "" leave of absence"" because they won't fire you or they would get sued, so a ""leave of absence"" is their loop hole of getting you out of their hair. They DO NOT care about their employees like they preach. Insurance isnt cheap either. A 30 min lunch on 10-15 hour days! Severe lack of advancement opportunity unless your the ""brown noser"" of the team, Certain employees can do what they want, too many double standards to list. One more thing, their human resources ""HeRE TEAM"" is a joke, they could care less about whats going on at the job site, so don't look to them to help you at all. I am not a bitter employee just ranting, these are facts! I would not recommend working for this company."
bad,"I worked in the “Cave” it was a terrible robotic experience. 20th Century work ethic, mistrust was rampant. Management acted like a dictatorship. I would not recommend"
bad,"I was given a 750 mile radius territory.  Therefore, while everyone else had 4 “quadrants”, I had 6.  This made it nearly impossible to stay within the guidelines of a 24 hour customer service call."
bad,"management did nothing to help field personnel. "
bad,stock shelves break down pallets at backrooms of stores lots of lifting pulling weight bending and reaching.
bad,"STAY AWAY!!! This company in Knoxville, TN are liars, I have worked here for over 5 years have been given no opportunity for promotion, you will work different schedule than you are hired for and it changes about once every 6 months with very little notice. The benefits are VERY expensive and are not much at all. They are on the buddy system when it comes to getting a better paying job so unless you kiss alot of butt, dont waste your time even if you are over qualified for the position you are applying for. The equipment is outdated and unsafe also."
bad,Drove from Santa Fe to Portales daily.
bad,I learned that no matter what they teach you at the academy about policy and procedure and integrity on your part. When you get there it's a totally different ball-game. Nothing you learned applies and everything and everyone is crooked as a politician. Not recommended.
bad,Say they pay you for mileage yeah sounds great right ...dont pay to get to the first stop mine is 37 miles away and get paid 10.25 an hour for about a 3.0 hour day.so you drive 74 miles day at least ... and mileage pay and make absolutely nothing for an hourly wage. You' ll make more at a fast food place ..really. Then you also have to answer to the store and customers when sales account managers. Seriously the place needs a reality check and merchandisers need raises. Management makes promises they cant or wont keep....and tell you what you want to hear. No 2 days off in a row thru the week.
bad,"As a supervisor, worked a 17 hr. shift for july 4th,with not even a thank you, additional compensation, comp time, nothing, This went on during all holidays. No time off EVER before, during holidays ever. If you have or want a family,or social life of any kind forget it. Mgmt. and HR will do whatever they have to, to whoever they have to, to get the job done, then they go home after 8 hrs. I was moved from one facility to another, back and forth, constant shift changes. Little if any training, union did not trust mgmt. at all. I was lied to and lied about, hurt on the job and then fired. My mgr. lied and HR backed them up, they will do whatever they have to do. Ethically this the worst work culture I have ever seen, it was stunningly unbelievable to see what lengths this company /mgmt. was willing to do to cover up things. The only way, even in this economy I would work here is if I was a very long time union worker. With OT my crew made more money than I did, even after I turned around the attitude, cut back on turnover and amount of work being done well, very well. Without a doubt the worst place to work, doubt that the home office knows what goes on....but then again maybe they do not care. The product still manages to get to the shelves, like I said they will do whatever they have to."
bad,"The boss that work at the beckley warehouse do not treat you like a person,some of the people that work there are good people."
bad,"Stressvol. Tot het uiterste geduwd."
bad,"Entreprise dotées de moyens conséquent qui malheureusement sont gaspillé par des responsables incompétent qui confond l armée et la logistique première entreprise ou vous êtes apprécié par votre soumission au pseudo Chef d équipe  , coordinateur bref beaucoup de comédien qui défend leurs bifteck par de la comédie efficacité performance à la ramasse."
bad,"This was a good learning opportunity of what to not look for in choosing a career."
bad,Les managers sont des vendeurs mais ils manquent de formation manageriales
bad,"At the high point of the summer or rather the busiest time of the year, you're working long hours and at times doing second or third stops at locations.  Instead of understanding that and actually thanking you for the hard work they powers that be simply offer you an over cooked BBQ which by the time you reach it, its been picked over and left to cool so that its inedible.  Its the greatest NON-thank you I have ever gotten!!"
bad,"This company is just like any other big corporation. Its all about the bottom line, and there is no such thing as loyalty."
bad,"I have worked here in the Truesdale,MO. plant and was very disapointed in the upper management, They say they are hiring for seasonal when in reality the union only allows for 30 days, Yet they are still in need of ""SEASONAL EMPLOYEES"" someone should man up and keep thier word about seasonal usually means a season winter spring summer fall are not these the seasons of Missouri? which one is only 30 days long? This is all upper management fault they have allowed this to go on for so long that it is now the norm, why have a union oh sorry it is a company owned and operated union, so not really a union,just another title that the company paid for so they can do what they wanted. If all the other Coca Cola plants were/are run in the same manner than the only ones writing these happy reviews are those that are KISSING S's"
bad,Worse company I have ever worked for.
bad,"Working at Coke was horrible; management only cared about volume and speed, and someone described the place to me as being a ""salt mine""! There was never any time to visit with anyone, and the work was grueling, with no appreciation or consideration. When you think of working at a company like Coca-Cola, you immediately think that it is together and a nice place to work, but take it from me, it was a horrible experience, and I would NEVER go back!"
bad,The management was terrible. They did not care about your personal life because they had no personal lives. They were all married to their jobs and were not understanding at all about work/life balance. No one was happy working there. It was terrible.
bad,"A typical day at work for me is: Being your own boss, they're isn't anyone hovering of your shoulder to tell you that hey, do this, this way or do that, that way. Your given a riding pallet jack to do you're work; along with a Blue tooth headset and handset. Then your start to build your pallet depending on what order is it and for what store your building the pallet for. You typically go home between 1am-3am. But moving up in my opinion: If Management don't like you, then you won't move up bottom line. If someone you have a problem doesn't like your it may make it even harder to move up. So Good Luck!"
bad,"Management was apathetic unable to answer questions, always answered with standard company verbage: We'll get back to you on that/ What ever meets the business needs / It is what it is / Just do what works for you"
bad,"steady work, good co-workers, like i said great paying job and great paying job did i mention great paying job.well it is a great paying job."
bad,"I had very high expectations working for such a famous global company, turned out not to be so, The company induction and promises are not followed with no training plan or support given, Very high resentment toward new starters from production staff especially if you have been given a position over them or are not family related. Bullying, racism, labelling and obscene language from production employees is common (they run the company) no support from management when reported. I am sure CCEP head office have no conception of what is going on at their wakefield site. And should be investigated."
bad,Une entreprise adaptée au début de carrière. Par contre un management impitoyable qui ne favorise pas l'évolution.
bad,they didn't treat service with any respect.all they did is push us to work all hours without any breaks.management was arrougant and would not take suggestions.
bad,"Coke used to be a good company to work for but micromanagement and the slashing of hours and resources have turned it into a terrible company to work for. The turnover is terrible with people leaving every week. Merchandisers used to be qualified candidates who were hired full time; now they are young people hired in part time with no benefits. The company cannot even get merchandisers to apply for management jobs because they are even more mistreated, therefore; the company is forced to hire younger college graduates who think that Coke is a good company until they realize it isn't and quit as well a year of two later."
bad,Great benefits/ company inconsistance in policy/ hiring based on hand picking not experiences. Safety issues concerns.
bad,Upper Management poor support
bad,A typical day at Coke is starting at 6 am and working to 7 pm. They continue to demand more and rarely say thank you for the work you have accomplished.
bad,"The pay was great, although management were like drill instructors. Quality was over-looked when it benefited them. This is one of the main parts of the job....preached everyday...quality, quality. When it came down to it, it had to be at their convienance when to ""overlook"" quality issues. The entire management team(from the top to the bottom) had their ""favorites"", if not in the clique, too bad."
bad,"I Consistently Took Home Less Money The Longer I Worked There. The Work is ok. Co-workers are fine. Management is the worst I have ever seen. If your thinking about working here, look at Pepsi First The Pay, Benefits, And Hours Are Better At Pepsi. If You are a hard worker and dependable coke is not for you. The Turnover rate is outrageous, after two years there I realized why. You will NOT make more money for working harder and taking on more responsibility. Forklift Operator would be your best bet at coke or warehouse."
bad,"Applied for the full-time position. Got the interview. Then supervisor pulls the we might have to start you out as part-time stunt on me. I take the part-time position while still working my other part-time job. (I NEEDED THE MONEY) Next the walls come crashing down when my routes are constantly changed. Store managers were arrogant. There is barely any team-work when each merchandiser has 4-6 stores to maintain on their own. I would get stuck at certain stores another 1-2 hours fixing/cleaning another merchandiser's mess. Truck drivers are jerk-offs dropping pallets any which direction they could, preventing me from finishing back stock. If drinks bust open, you can expect to be mopping shopping floor for another 30 minutes. Everyone store manager is a snitch pointing their finger at you because you weren't SUPERMAN to them. Worst of all, I had attended 3 board meetings inquiring about the full-time position that I had applied to see a female get hired. Overall, you're always hungry and mentally exhausted, the management's demands are unrealistic and you're ready to give up as soon somebody complicates what already is a tough day."
bad,"The 20/20 vision has no room for male EEs. 1 of every 50 hired is a male. All others are female, even if they have no experiance. Coke would rather hire from outside than promote thier own if they can stick a feather in the hat and get a women."
bad,"This is by far and away the most unsafe place you will ever work at. When you are an order builder, you have to be at a certain efficiency percentage, which is somewhat high. Downside is that when you have to work at a certain speed, you try to work like you are the only order builder in the warehouse. This was a former bottling facility and therefore it is a very,very cramped space. The absolute only good thing about Coke is the benefits. Glad to get out of there."
bad,"over all the company wasnt what I thought it would be. I was able to work with customers with this job. The management wasnt what I had in mind when it came to the job itself. The co-workers was both good and bad as far as working together and getting your job completed at a manageable time, we worked from sun up to sun down . there really wasnt anything enjoable about the job."
bad,Upper management needs to work with HR because they are not fair with Everyone
bad,"I wished I would have taken everyone's advice when they said ""Don't go work there"" but I didn't. The only positive is that the pay was great. That was the only positive. Period. The Hitler-like managers treat you like dirt, coupled with mass disorganization, not to mention the work is physically exhausting- makes for an extremely unpleasant working environment. You don't have time to take a break all day. You don't even get any job perks like free coke. Word to the wise- Avoid working for Coke in Rome at all costs- (Unless you want to put in 15+ years just to be fired for some petty reason just before retirement) Work for Pepsi, they are much better to their employees in this town."
bad,The Brand is great and I believe the company as a whole is great as well; the team in Bakersfield is unprofessional and uneducated. Too Bad
bad,"I have only worked for coca cola refreshments for a few months. The job is very active and physical which i enjoy. The company has very poor communication to employees and lacks training needed. On a very rare ocasion I work with someone else but so far all co-workers are very nice and easy to work with. The hardest and most frustrating part of the job is getting past the communication barier and lack of training, how can I do something I wasnt trained to do?"
bad,"You think coca cola and you think prestige and wealth. Well that true in some places but not Abilene,Tx . If it aint broke...It aint coke was our saying"
bad,The culture was poor at the location I was at.  There was little cooperation among the employees.  Many jobs worked right through almost every holiday.  The work-life balance was thus poor.  I would not recommend the company to others.
bad,"had to run machines for 12 hour shifts, report faults, find faults, talk to line managers and senior managers, had to do asset care tasks and lubrication sheets, housekeeping had to be done as well. I learned many things as i went into coca cola with no knowledge at all. I worked with many good people and enjoyed my time with them. The management was very strict and not enjoyable to work with."
bad,"You come in find your route and keys , see your assignment for the day . Generally 12 hours worth of stops scheduled for a day , equipment is based on a seniority and timing. Then its just a race from that point on , faster you get done the better . Coke expects you to throw 95 cases a hour , while industry stardards are 65 cases a hour/ , with better compensation. they might achieve this . But at what they pay 120 a day plus , 4 cents per 100 cubes over 700 ( slave labor ) ,"
bad,Plan on working at the company for a few years. Not many will retire from here. They find a way to elimante your position.
bad,"If you want to be micromanaged, blamed for everything that goes wrong, and no matter how good a job you do, it will never be good enough, then you must join the coca cola cult In the beginning they treat you like gold, giving you all kinds of goodies to get you to buy into the cult. Once you hit the floor you become a piece of dirt. I broke out in a rash, could not sleep, and my blood pressure hit the roof due to all the pressure. They also go so far as to tell you who you need to vote for president so they can increase their profits. You can forget being promoted unless you are one of the chosen ones who can do no wrong, or you know someone higher up. There is retribution, discrimination, and unsupported managers.If you are going to apply or interview for a position RUN, RUN, RUN! And keep your sanity and dignity."
bad,"This is a great job place only if you are a minority especially in the chicago/Northwest Indiana are. The plant manager at Portage has no clue about the pop business ands boss likes to try to intimidate white people to g his way. The whole H.R. is a great big joke, they don't care about the front line workers as long as they hit there numbers this all they care about!"
bad,"Odwalla RSR, beyond your worst imagination. Lied to constantly, zero comunication, screwed up hours, equipment horrible, handheld horible, management horible. Your actually treated like a farm animal, all you need is a feed bag to hang around your neck. Then you go out to service the accounts and every receiver treats you like your a criminal. Constantly rushing to meet receiving times, but there isn't a day that will run smoothly. If you like working in total negativaty, this is the job for you, your wife will love your new additude."
bad,"People are working here on agency for years, yet when it comes to take someone full time the job is given to someone from the outside, usually member of family from someone inside. The way some managers treat workers is absolutely disgusting. It’s a culture of bullying. Agency workers are being constantly threatened with loosing jobs for example if they don’t want to do overtime or they go off sick. Interviews are an absolute rubbish . Doesn’t matter how you do or what you say or how hard you work. If they don’t like your face you won’t get a job. Sick and tired of this place."
bad,"I worked here knowing it would be temporary. With that said, I did not enjoy working for the company. The people I worked with were pleasant, but the company, horribly, under paid their employees."
bad,"Worked for Coca-Cole Enterprises, not this company. Enjoyed the work while I was there until the last few months, when they tried to come after me for an internal clerical error over my hourly pay after finding the mistake a year later. Many insults and threats were thrown at me, including any future employment. All over them giving me a pay raise they later claimed was too much."
bad,"Ran the HR Department locally, worked closely with all the Factory Employees, managed payroll, time off, Leave of absence, Work related injuries, OSHA compliance and EEOC."
bad,"There isn't any kind of communication between the employees, and management like there should be. The time you work is very difficult, and the pay isn't that good."
bad,"No proper training given, very stressful environment. No cooperation from management in any area."
bad,"Puts employees last, upper management will do what it takes to get ahead and in my experience, I have witnessed them falsey accuse their employees and lower mangement of wrong doing's."
bad,Long days but rewarding.
bad,me gusto estar hay por que aprendi muchas cosas que me an servido para mi bienestar siempre la pasaba bien con mis compañeros nos atendia muy bien nunca nos falto nada y nos apoyamos mutuameste la parte mas dificil era salir a repartir en el carro los productos.
bad,THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU YOU ARE ONLY A NUMBER TOTHEM Worked there for many years but they have no loyalty to you
bad,"there was no room for work life balance at all."
bad,10+hrs
bad,A typical day at Coca-Cola included calling existing customers and taking their needed order for the week or month. Management as a whole were really nice although there isn't room for movement in this call center. I went in with the idea this is my stepping stone for outside sales and learned that there isn't a way to get outside when you start from inside
bad,"I unloaded and loaded trucks. Rotated products, moved trucks off the dock."
bad,"you will be stuck working for an agency for years whilst people who know friends or family within the company can be here less than a month and receive full time jobs behind your backs.  full time employees recieved a one off payment of £500 to vote against time and a half pay. this included people who were unable to do over time and those who were due to leave in the coming months. management do not care about the workers, your just a number here.  there is nobody who you can see if you have a problem, they just care about making you do as much as possible and pay you little as possible. they increase the workload without having any input from the workers or any feedback, they simply do not care as they can just replace you with another agency worker. claims to be the biggest production site in Britain yet brings more loads into the warehouse than what actually goes out. claims to have over 2000 days accident day free record which is also a lie. health and safety is out of the window, only care about what the visitors can see, been working in this place 2 years and cant wait to get out. the company reputation is built on a lie."
bad,"Bonne ambiance au sein des petites cellules, collègues sympas et bon dynamisme dans notre département."
bad,"Great fellow employees, but as far as management the only thing they care about is making numbers and demoralizing the people under them, don't care about your personal life and don't promote the most qualified person for the job. If you are a female or a minority you won't have any problems."
bad,"I was hired as a class A CDL driver, as advertised on the internet and in front of the plant itself. Instead I was assigned to another driver to load the Coke machines. I thought at first this was just part of the initiation, but it became very clear to me that they had no intention of letting me drive. I told my supervisor regularly that I had no oppostition to loading machines, but I wanted to use the CDLs I had worked so hard to gain, and that I would have to look for another job if the opportunity did not materialize. They kept promising me new trucks had been ordered, but they never happened. When I finally pressed for a definate answer, I was told they were not hiring CDL drivers. When I pointed out I was told I was being hired for that, the postition was being advertised online, and the sign was still out front, they asked me to stay anyway and took the job posts down. When I left, cordially I might add, I was accused of insubordination."
bad,I was an order builder here and the job is crazy fast paced. You need to be in good physical condition to do this job. The pay was good but you are forced to do madatory over time daily and Saturdays almost always.
bad,"In my tenure here, I have learned valuable lessons and now looking to move onward and upward!"
bad,"As a Builder, my job was to collect the products and prepare them to be shipped. The atmosphere is one of reluctance and lack of care. No one really wanted to be there and very few cared for their co-workers beyond the need to bypass them. "
bad,majority of machines to get job done were down (motorized pallet jacks). no air flow. no job advancements. would not work with my schedule for college.
bad,"long days, good benifits and not much work life balance, not a place I would suggest a person to seek employment"
bad,"Good company to build a resume. You will learn what it is like to be nothing more than a number! Too many hours (12-14), no work life balance, and a very disconneted management team. Compensation leaves a lot to be desired."
bad,gone from being a great company to work for to a company that DOES not care about their employees
bad,"I wouldn’t recommend anyone to apply for any jobs at Coca Cola. There is no place for growth, only a few people get promoted. Education is not valued, no work life balance."
bad,"Start at 8am, finish at 17.30. The day to day job is varied and interesting, fixing drinks dispensers, vending machines and coolers. Training is ok but H&S is paramount , which is good."
bad,"client pas correct, non respect de sa parole. Hypocrite, pas sérieux"
bad,Go to stores to merchandise customers and build displays. Most of the time you're getting called to go help other workers on they're route cause they just can't keep up.
bad,Its a okay job.Working overtime for the first time is the only hard part.I met alot of good co workers.The management sucks.
bad,"No family life at all, they say they want you to have one, but always overload you with tasks that almost impossible to complete in a typical work day, usually work day 14 to 16 hours and sometimes more."
bad,"A day at work was to build orders/tickets with voicepick around the warehouse, i learned about pallet jacks voicepick system and the process of distribution."
bad,"standing for long periods of time, short breaks, bad management."
bad,"I worked for various departments of the Coca Cola company over 16 years before being terminated. The Coca Cola company can be a great place to work, the compensation and benefits are fair. The facilities are better than most and some of the perks like working at The North American Headquarters are fantastic. But, the major shortfall is the lack of a clear career track and the racist good old boy system still exists.."
bad,my over all review of this company is that they need more training on family issues that arrive and also work injuries
bad,Enorm prestatiegericht!!  Geen keuze welke regio je kan merchandisen. Geen doorgroeimogelijkheden. Fysiek zware arbeid die niet geapprecieerd wordt door het valse management!!
bad,"This company is developed on the sense of how well you suck up and follow those above. Not a job for progressive Individuals with life goals. Getting vacation is more like pulling teeth, and the company is more worried about sales and product then they are the employees. Avoid this company for sanity reasons."
bad,"Look elsewhere, long hours, very little room for advancement, long hours, tiny to no existent raises"
bad,"they don't give the right people the encouragement needed and when you are doing a great job you don't hear anything about it, its not an American ran company and they don't like Canada at all, co-workers are great but upper management not so great. i worked 10 years here and worked my way up from sales to manager and then out of no where they drop the position in Chatham and package me out. my #s and work ethics were great and that didn't matter to them, its too bad company's are like this still today, its a shame"
bad,"Coca Cola sells itself no matter how hard management tries to drive the brand into the ground. The way this company conducts it's business, the iconic trademark keeps them afloat. Horrible atmosphere, use the ""fear for your job"" line to motivate employees.No self thinkers need apply, just puppets. After 23 yrs I finally had enough. If the job market was better, more employees would leave."
bad,"Its a job where you go to work and you dont know what stores your covering that day,You get an email asking you to go to this store and it gives you a time which per coke is what it takes to service that location."
bad,Standing and working at a fast pace for ten or more hours.You learned to be patient with the uncertainty of the day.Some of my co-worker believe in team-work and some don't i'am a firm believer in team-work and think all should work as a team. The hardest part of the job is that there is no consistency and the most enjoyable is finishing my shift and going home safe and well to my family.
bad,"A well respected company from the outside,but on the inside is a company does not value its employees."
bad,I would load my truck to prepare my daily route duties. Management could be better.I liked working with some of the co-workers while I was employed.The hardest part of the job were some of the locations for the machines. The most enjoyable part of the job was the optional overtime and the light supervision
bad,"Kaum ein anderes Produkt verkörpert so den ""American Way of Life"" wie Coca Cola. Amerika ist für seine Einfachheit in den Dingen bekannt, der Kunde ist dort stets König."
bad,"I had a great boss, he did whatever it took to get the job done, there was hard work at this job, but I made work at the time, there were lots of great people that worked here."
bad,"Most people at COCA COLA ENTERPRISES were very nice and positive Co-workers.  Worked well with forklift drivers,  Never had a problem with most fellow Co-workers."
bad,"Expect to do everything yourself, no help from management when you have projects going on. its your job description plus twenty other things that are not part of your job."
bad,"wat ik geleerd heb is het omgaan met de collegas "
bad,"Company is going down hill. More worried about polices and procedures than people, customers and doing what's right."
bad,"Terrible experience.  work 13-18 hours per day, six days a week.  Very unorganized.  No support from management.  Worst experience of my life.  "
bad,I did not like this job. It was a merchandiser learning position
bad,Day starts at either four am or five am this varies. Equipment is sometimes unavailable to accomplish efficently. Never in same tractor or trailer. Management unwilling to listen to suggestion for improvement.
bad,"I would not suggest this company to work for, good benefits and good pay, but the pay is NOT worth what they put you through. You work 6-7 days in a row, 10-13hr long shifts. No other life.... you get your sched one day before the next week starts, how cant you make plans with that. Then you get your sched and they change it last min at 11pm when you're suppose to be at your first stop at 4am"
bad,"The management is very unprofessional in delegating a work schedule. At times i wont know if i have to work the next day until almost 11 pm, which is beyond normal business hours. The workload is outrageous, and if you encounter an emergency, you have to wait 60 days before you can call out for any reason or you will be written up. 60 days is a long time to try to avoid an emergency."
bad,"This particular job showed me about this importance of being prompt, early and paying attention to details."
bad,"After a long tenure at CCE I was made redundant, this was a relief.  Over the years the organisation had changed significantly and from an employee perspective it wasn't for the best.  The things that made the firm great to work for slowly disappeared, management became controlling, agility became non-existent and the culture virtually non-existent. Despite leaving several years ago, friends that remain tell me nothing has changed. Disappointing for such a huge brand."
bad,"Excellent benefits but life is a lot more than that."
bad,"The day starts with no one really speaking a ""good morning"" management speaks to selective few.   There is no support from management. Co-workers has no true understanding of ""Co-workers"".  The most enjoyable part about my job is I knew my job and others would come knowing they would get reliable information that would make their work environment easier.  I enjoyed traveling and providing support to others.  I've learned that I can do anything with little or no supervision."
bad,"Very hectic schedule with very limited resources provided to perform to company expectations."
bad,"move literally tons of product by physically lifting sorting pulling pallets building and tearing down displays, stocking shelves, rotating products by sell dates, stocking coolers, repacking product damages, organizing warehouses. Interaction with various grocery retail business's management following there store guidelines as well as Coca-Cola's policies and procedures. POS pricing, Inventory procedures.  Customer interaction merchandisers are the face of Coca-Cola. "
bad,"It was a good place to work for, the pay just was not very good"
bad,They do not get paid enough for this job. There is never enough equipment for the drivers to use. The co-workers are very nice. The hardest part of the job is knowing you doing alot of work and will not be compensated for it.
bad,Great bunch of guys to work with I was there 25yes made redundant god knows only why a lot of us were made redundant bad management only want agencies to work there management tell a lot of lies to employees no need for redundancies but they and the Coca Cola company did it anyway good money good people there to but trust no one but yourself
bad,"En tant que merchandiser Cocal-Cola, après trois années passées à ce poste, à raison de six contrats de six mois consécutifs après une période d'intérim, les contrats ne sont plus renouvelés, la raison donnée par la direction étant que ce poste est trop physique."
bad,"As Account Manager II I serviced the South Orange County area, about 90 accounts, small store and drug chains. (CVS,Walgreens, Rite Aid) I would inventory account, set coolers, write orders, in drug stores follow sale ads and order, build displays, and rotate inventory."
bad,management is always picking at negatives instead of positives that u do on a daily basis. co-workers are good people.hardest part of the job would be the harassment and dealing with a lot of stress from management always pushing no matter how much over time u have already done. The most enjoyable part of the job would be clocking out to go home
bad,A typical day is working 6AM-6PM solving problems and dealing with issues that you cannot control
bad,"This was one of the most frustrating jobs I have ever had. This company produces the most popular, recognizable brand in the world yet this company blows money daily."
bad,The day started at 6 AM and you never knew when it would end. There were days I worked 6 AM - 10 PM. The managers were not managers at all. Many were miserable and let you know it whenever they had the chance.
bad,"...Worked in sales for 9 years and had 6 district managers. Five of them were great the last one was all I could take. Company runs in cycles as far as the way they treat employees. Every two years it runs from ""Our employees are the greatest."" Then two years later they are laying off the experienced folks who are making too much and everyone is on pins and needles."
bad,"No work/life balance. not much chance for advancement. More, more, more is the culture."
bad,er heerst een sfeer dat binnenkort alles wat distributie betreft zal ophouden te bestaan wat voor veel onzekerheid zorgt.
bad,Upper management is completely clueless about the reality of operations. San Leandro Coca-Cola management is lost and looking for low paying supervisors to make up their lack of experience.. .
bad,Great company to work for and opportunities are there for you if you are prepared to work hard and are flexible with your location. They tend to re-structure a lot so you need to be adaptable to change but the pay is poor until you get into a senior management position.
bad,"This is a horrible job for someone with a family. No work life balance, management team was horrible, merchandisers want do there jobs, buddy buddy system in place, everyone is always in a bad mood, co workers were great and flex schedule was great and pay was great."
bad,Work on shifts very busy schedules . had a great experience in handling different machines.The management was friendly. The co-workers were cooperative. The hardest part of the job was sometimes workingtwo shifts without having a break. The most enjoyable part if you are in a good relationship with co-workers and the boss.
bad,A typical day at work was working out in the field with my customers. I have built a great relationship with them over the years.
bad,This company isn't any different than any other company in the world. The only difference is what they do on the outside rather than anything internal.
bad,"Hard job to do, good co workers, ok managers, good trucks, ok pay and long hours."
bad,"Coca Cola Refreshments now in US is alittle sad. Pay is low, (for chgo area) if your a puppet and have no need to be an individual its great. mainly hire under 30...security is good but will you last. no opportunity to move up. they took away the car, good ins. gas car and give an allowance. looks good on resume but its not a happy environment"
bad,I would get told to do one thing and the get in trouble for it the next day. My supervisor would tell his boss that I would do things different without being told and that was not the case. I continually received conflicting instructions and expectations.
bad,"Loved working for them, but when I went to transfer to another location, the district manager in location never returned my calls when I got in to the area. I was told to contact him when I got in to area to figure out start date, but they never returned my calls."
bad,"Coca-Cola is such an outstanding company with great history, but the most important part of it, the distribution centers, are terrible work environments, supervised by some of the worst managers I have ever worked with. "
bad,"I always felt that I could learn something new everyday, so everyday I did. I got the opportunity to always do different assignments. I felt that my supervisors didn't need to babysit me. I build a good relationship with them to be trusted to do my job. I learn about making a very well known product and to make sure it got to our customers in excellent condition, from start to finish."
bad,"Coca cola is good place to work you will have fun when learn how to performing Duties .Coke have good management give you abilities to learn co -workers always working as a team so the hardest part of the .Job is when it,s raining .The enjoyable part of the job is when you completed all your stop early"
bad,-start day at an account
bad,"In terms of the work procedures and working environment , coca-cola offer the best work environment and benefits to their employees and ensure they are taken care of however the products that they showcase on their range are false the packaging details are deceptive and not true. This cannot be trusted, their drinks are not what you assume they contain the highest levels of sugar even the diet and zero coke drink."
bad,"job was okay but everybody deserves a off day, some time with family is always good. this place have you working 6 days a week 12 hours a day. and any little thing you do wrong you get fired."
bad,"Le système de reporting Coca-cola avait beau être très poussé et soit disant novateur pour son temps, il ne rendait néanmoins pas les gens heureux en interne.  Même si mon expérience fut courte, j'y ai cependant beaucoup appris sur le monde des grosses entreprises et le fonctionnement de ces dernières avec les agences."
bad,I really thought the project length should been longer. Met some really nice people. Typical day at work was somewhat pleasant. The most enjoyable part of the job was the collaboration.
bad,Great place to work.  Large corporation and great people.  Great customer service and opportunity for advancement.  Great culture.
bad,"- PME de 19 salariés"
bad,"i usually ride around on a rider pallet jack mover, pick cases, place them on a pallet, once that's finished i place the pallet in a machine that covers the pallet in plastic shrink wrap. co-workers are nice. management was okay."
bad,"The job is very demanding, and has a low pay structure. many day to day issues."
bad,typical day consisted of getting there at 4:00 a.m. help the night shift finish there duties then i would check the product going on the trucks then load them to make sure they had everything then i would clean the warehouse til around 10:00 am then i would start on my job picking orders to be loaded that night 
bad,"No onsite training, long hours with hourly employees making make more then their supervisors in overtime"
bad,"My experience with years of service with my current job and company. Have worked with many kinds of people external and internal. I enjoy working with others along meeting new people. Currently consists in the Office as an Administrator doing various jobs such as payroll, HR paperwork, customer service and busy switchboard along with many other office detailed duties. As far as the hardest part I cannot really think of one. The enjoyable part is working with many types people from managers to my co workers. I also like learning new skills along with using my own experiences to help with myself gain the skills I need to be production in my job"
good,long nights after the new organization was in affect. the management in my department was slim to none. the only thing fun about the job was the co-workers. hardest part was the long nights waiting and waiting to be able to load and unload trucks. most enjoyable part was clocking out at the end of the night
good,"The organization was a good job for 1998-2002, with a decent pay for that time . The worst part was overworking their employees and no chance for a promotion unless you were associated with management in the corporate office."
good,During my time at Coca-Cola there were a lot of ups and a lot of downs. this is a great career. if you solely want to focus on a job. the work load is heavy if you like it like I do. however there is a complete lack of management support. I have had some excellent managers and at the end a not so good one.  overall I liked what I did. but you have to watch your every move and sell yourself meaning you do not have a family or personal life. and one wrong move you are gone
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job is meeting new people everyday.  The sad part is that credit is not given to where credit is due to particular employees."
good,"You will be promised one thing and do another once hired. Typical work week for managers is +-60 hrs.  no work life balance. Management likes to deviate from policy and not consistent in anything.   pros  looks good on a resume. If you do not get call backs now, you will with 6mo under your belt at Coca-Cola"
good,Very Stressful place to work. I believe The Coca Cola Company is not what I saw in this facility in Tucson.
good,"Great company to go to work for, in the 'away-from-home towel and tissue'  industry.  Treats employees very well.  Small company but my experience has been that they are super fast to react and to get answers for their sales people.  Have been here for two years and have grown professionally and learned a lot about the paper (towel and tissue) industry.  Wausau was recently acquired by a large towel and tissue manufacturer; SCA.  My experience with Wausau and thus far with SCA is that both employers treat their employees well, compensation is fair, benefits (phone, comp, healthcare, vacation, healthclub reimbursement, vehicle allowance, ) are all strong."
good,"A typical day consist of building pallets of product from noon till 2 to 4 am. I did learn a few things such as how to operate a electric rider pallet jack and how to keep my stamina up to work 14 to 20 hour shifts. management is a little confusing at times. the co-workers are really great though everyone is very helpful and the makes a good work environment. The hardest part of the job is how long we work at a time doing constant lifting and stacking of heavy products, the job don't physically get hard till after 13 hours then its just tiring.The most enjoyable part of the job is the people, everyone is easy to make friends with and fun to work with."
good,there are some pregistes within the company. but overall i enjoyed my employment
good,"I was a clerk, took care of service calls. Scheduled removal and installation of new equipment. Schedule techs go out and fix vending machines."
good,"I assist in the supervision of over fifteen delivery drivers, do inventory control, daily reports using Microsoft Excel, Email, and Fax. I collabarate with Drivers, Cash Office, and Distribution Manager to ensure timely delivery of cash safe to remote cash office. Assist Distribution Manger with daily tasks. Cash reconcilition for Drivers at end of their day, Order supplies, and secure facility at the end of each shift."
good,I liked working here for a limited amount of time. This shouldn’t be a long term job. It does have the opportunity for advancement after a while. No way of getting in contact with workers without a personal cell phone.
good,Es una empresa que reconoce poco o nada al trabajador.
good,"Typical day consisted of working other representatives routes while they were on vacation.  Most time was spent developing business opportunities, establishing growth plan for individual accounts and personally managing account calls, presentations, and negotiations. Manage was chaotic, as was the workplace culture.  Hardest part was working a different geography on a daily basis, with unreliable vehicles.  Most enjoyable aspect was introducing new products into the marketplace, and for coordinating promotional, in store campaigns to increase consumer awareness."
good,"enjoyed working here."
good,I like working for this company. I worked nights and weekends So I left to find a day job.Then this facility ended up closing.
good,"I worked for this company for about 11 years and the whole 11 years I had issues with the management teams communication, their ability to always force their employees too work over at last minute. Management team would talk about each other. I enjoyed what I did just didn't really care for the way management did things."
good,"Operating a machine required me to be very attentive to detail, as something can happen at any moment that could cause the entire line to backup! However, once everything is in motion the job was relatively easy. The hardest part of the job was finding supervisors when a problem occurred, as there aren't to many in the plant I work in, production."
good,Check drivers out to start there routs. Review all reports attendance and hours of service. Monitor drivers for on time delivery. I learned how to manage in a high pace distribution system. Management was okay and over the 5 years I have had some good co workers. the hardest part was working with limited communication. we had to call the accounts to reach the driver's. the most enjoyable part was the month end challenge to reach the numbers.
good,"enjoyable working enviroment, work hours where flexiable and allowed time to support your own personal needs."
good,a lot of empty driving miles..the local guys were great.seemed the head office had a different view how things should ran..
good,interpersonal skills
good,"This job was physically demanding and there was little to no work/life balance. I enjoyed my coworkers. However, managements expectations for productivity were unrealistic."
good,I would check the orders with what was built.Correct any mistakes made.Mark all items that were out of stock.check loads on the trucks to verify if loaded correctly.Check loads on trucks coming in to the plant.
good,"I am a Coca-Cola employee of 19 years. I worked through college at the company working at a syrup plant. learned many jobs and worked myself up as a manager. The company purchased Coca-Cola Enterprises in 2010. A failing company saturated with debt and poor management including layers of people and red tape. Poor skills in managing cost including inflated debt and uncontrollable spend. The company now has turned over control of their syrup,water and juice plants to these people. A failing group in their own right, CCE management is inflicting their lack of manufacturing experience on Legacy Coca-Cola facilities. In the Great Lakes region, we have and had a very good diverse work force. The Coca-Cola Company has always strived to create a diverse work foce in the past. However, this regional RVP is bent on back filling all plant manager positions in the region with African American males from outside the company. Many of them being ""friends"". Never a problem in the past as many african american males were groomed within the company for these jobs. As a white male working in the company for many years, diversity was ingrained in our culture. Now, certain individuals wish to destroy it in a short period of time."
good,"started after training of approx 6 hours a day hours increased to 10-12 with more stops and time, but no more compensation"
good,"As a Customer Service Coordinator at Coca-Cola Refreshments, I am the liaison for customer satisfaction at the North Metro Distribution Center. Along with customer service create new accounts for the sales team, coordinate their fundraiser orders, credits, and assist the team as needed to help them maintain volume in their area. I also coordinate donation orders and special event orders with different departments on the corporate level. I love what I do and believe that me taking this position was a great step to the next level of the business which is apart of my sales background."
good,"-A typical work day is long, lasting from 6:00 to possibly 5:00."
good,Bottling and canning lines - no longer at this location. Union plant. Now just a warehouse. Used to be noisy and fast conditions. Mgt that ran the plant were actually across state and phoned in schedules.
good,"Customers within costa are okay staff however, they make you feel uncomfortable like you know nothing at all they try to take over and make you feel like you are stupid and clueless I hope to leave this job ASAP"
good,"•	Microbiologie"
good,Haven't worked there in so long I am sure everything has changed.  It has been sold several different times.   Not sure what I can say in this review to make it helpful.
good,"Entreprise sympa grâce à la cohésion des employés qui la compose."
good,"Exciting place to work - Coke is one of the most recognized brands in the world."
good,"The call center has a relaxed atmosphere and dress code. The sales computer system is poor, outdated and frustrating to work with for a billion dollar multi national corporation with the most recognizable brand in the world."
good,"on the go none stop from 6:30 to 4:00, ordering parts, contacting vendors, managing maintenance software, being a technical resource for maintenance mechanics, attending meetings."
good,"Good solid job, hard physical labor and decent pay with extremely early hours and little time off."
good,A typical day at work consists of taking inventory on all materilas running reports in SAP and compare counts to inventory reports. I am also a produfction buyer so I compare production schedules and determine what materials need to be purchased for customer demand orders.
good,"Days begin at 7am, and end around 4:30-5:00pm. During this time, I call on twelve to fourteen of my 21 accounts that have been assigned to me. This job has generally been an amazing learning experience. It has been a great introduction to the world of sales. I handle everything from trucking, to introducing and selling new, high GP product lines to my customers.I am confident that what I have taken from this experience will no doubt aid me for years to come. The most important tool I have taken from this particular job, is self management, I generally make my own daily schedule, 90% of my time is spent calling on clients and accounts, outside of the office, this forces you to truly become the master of your own world. One of the hardest parts about this job is the lack of complete control, with regard to trucking issues, warehouse shortages, and merchandiser insubordination, to name a few. The best part about this job, for me, is the ability to create new and lasting relationships with my customers, this has certainly become a highlight. The account managing team as a whole, is a pleasure to work with. We are made up of a team of 21 sales reps that handle Large Store accounts for Long Island, youthful and like minded over all. Upper Management can at times be slightly detached from the sales team, however, they always maintain a passionate and driven energy throughout the branch."
good,Identify and introduce to business owners of increase sale potentials and opportunities
good,There are people in the organization that want to build their career on the backs of others. They will claw and scratch their way and not worry who gets in the way. The company intentions are great but some of the people need to work else where.
good,Great people who are only given directives and rarely asked for input.
good,"Though I have learned a lot while being employed with Coca-Cola, and always assumed this would be my only career, the room for growth has come to a halt."
good,"Coca Cola Enterprises was a good entry level sales job.  The compensation was disproportionate with the effort put forth by those in sales and service roles.  All in all, a worthwhile place to start."
good,My time spent at Coca-Cola was extremely stressful. I worked 6-7 days per week. There was very little time to spend with my family. It was difficult to keep quality employees due to the environment.
good,"Good company with a good product offering.  It has been over eight years since I was there, so I do not feel qualified to make any other assessments about the company or the current management."
good,Lot of physical activity. Pulling pallets up and down a lot. Big downfall was being at the account managers will when it comes to orders and they would order too much product.
good,Coke is a very busy place with good benefits and plenty of job security .Most days are spent going from store to store building displays and stocking shelves .
good,"Terrific focus and control of Supply Chain to ensure productive and profitable system."
good,"A lot of ideas fell upon deaf ears. Did not offer many advancement opportunities. Grew tired of promises that never went through quickly. If your idea job is to just ""work"" and not move up or any other position than this job may be for you. Co-workers aren't too dependable but it more falls on the workload being placed on them by management. The hardest part of this job is waking up at 5 for work, but not getting off until 7 or later (at times)."
good,The work was challenging and hard which I liked.  Very physical fast paced environment.  The only part I really didn't care for was the lack of communication with management and Sales staff.  The lack of a full staff wasn't helpful either.
good,"Without a degree it's difficult to move anywhere within the company.  They say they promote from within, however I haven't seen this happen.  I have attempted to even get an interview for various jobs and have not been able to."
good,"Receive communications from posted work schedules and management for proper sanitation. Monitor water treatment for processing problems. The most difficult part of the job is time management. The lines run pass the shut off time due to production requirements not being met. This sets the sanitation process behind, not being able to perform start ups on time."
good,"A typical day starts around 5:00 A.M. Readying a load to be delivered, doing daily pre-trips. Typical day includes delivering 400-500 cases of soda a day, Usually to 12 or so stops. Hardest part of the job is waking up so early."
good,"I manage 32 Union employees, included are 18 transport drivers that I set up daily schedules for.  I keep 4 fast paced production lines moving while managing a shipping dock."
good,of course great benefits. after killing yourself trying to work you will need the benefits. Management are all about helping themselves. The most enjoyable part of the job was the discounts on the beverages.
good,Challenging with good benefits for fulltime employees. Opportunities to travel to Europe.
good,"I was at CocaCola(Alsip,Il) as a ""Merchandiser,"" for about 8 years. made good money, always had an option to work 6,7 days a week.$$. Not that complicated but very labor intense. Drove my own car to accounts daily. Build displays took them down a week later build another like clock work. I applied for higher positions and was never considered. I enjoyed my stay, promoting within is pretty bad. Never even got a interview. As the years passed and as Supervisors would come and go, I finally got a Sup that was not fond of me and let me go for being Tardy( we punch in via smartphone at the store) !! I was a floater that covered a different account every day.... 8 years..."
good,"Coca-Cola gave my job away by outsourcing to Centyral America in 2008. This did not make me happy. I have heard rumors that Coke may be bringing back the jobs they outsourced. I am leary, having enjoyed my job for over 10 yrs. The worst part of my experience was when Coke quit matching the 401-K at a decent amount. The best part of my day was when I created an excel worksheet for the customer to pay from and received the customers payment. I was a quiet worker and the social people would gather around my desk to have their discussions. I made attempts by speaking with supervisors and some of the individuals. Nothing changed. Management could have been much better. CCE had its own agenda and that did not include me."
good,"Call on customers within your territory to order and stock Coke products. Provide the customer with information on promotions and the marketing materials available. Sell in incremental displays, equipment, and promotional programs. The hardest part of the job is stocking the value channels and the best part was meeting so many different people."
good,"In my days with Coca Cola I was treated poorly to the point where I left 6 years of seniority behind to go to a job with no promises and possibly no future, everything was a gamble but it paid off. You were expected to be a robot, do what they say and ask no questions. My ex-boss was transferred and then terminated, he was a tyrant. I'd never work for them and suggest you do the same."
good,It's not what you'll expect from a world-class cola manufacturer. Techs are typically not the best and not happy due to long to do list of outstanding jobs.
good,"family atmosphere, flexible scheduling for college students, had to drive in inclement weather, lack of co-worker accountability was a frequent issue, product rotation was a high priority to avoid company losses"
good,Des annee de vie perdu en travaillant en 3*8 . Tout pout les actionneur
good,"Coca cola is a great place to work, with a lot of good benefits. The management needs a lot of work. Too many cooperate buy outs. No consistence in the rules."
good,Daily route driver delivering Coca Cola products to customers within a region.  Secondary duties as Utility Relief & forklift driver.  Also assisted in-store salesman for special promotions.
good,"Typical work day was busy, customer follow ups, the ability to using analysis to forecast data. Management was stable, and hands on, the work culture was cut throat. hardest part was meeting sales goals, most enjoyable was building customer relationships."
good,"a typical day at work consist of visiting all accounts on the pre arranged schedule, discussing all customer service, marketing, billing or ordering issues. collecting payments for any statements that are outstanding (cash, check, credit)"
good,"Overworked, underpaid, often used for jobs I wasn't trained for, when I was trained it was in depth and the pay and benefits the job was good, the management not so"
good,"Working at Coca-Cola has been a great stepping stone for me in my career as a young person. My average day consisted of solving complex business needs for my customers and working with my team to achieve targets. The management has been supportive in helping me develop my communication skills and sales technique, alongside my team who have been a guidance for me on a daily basis. I have learnt how to juggle customer and business needs, and have become an expert in the art of selling."
good,"A day of a Coca-Cola MDM would consist of face to face orders as long as visiting existing customers. Also 50% of the time is spent prospecting for new potential customers. I learned how to manage different aspects of the sales function from beginning to end. I had the opportunity to work with distribution, marketing, and assist in the allocation of equipment as well sharpen my customer service skills. The hardest part of the my job is the lack of career advancement. The most enjoyable parts of the job is interacting with customer and opening new business."
good,"good place to work.drive to different places dropping off material,"
good,Job pays well . Company is ran very poorly. Co workers are great. Show up wait for your truck to be built and loaded then go run your route.
good,I enjoy my job but the supervisors really have no clue what is going on. They implemented a new loading system and it is less efficient then what we used to do. Hourly wages need to be raised for the work you actual do. I am an order builder and for what I do I feel I deserve a couple extra dollars hourly. Hard work really doesn't pay off. I do lots of extra work around the warehouse which you are actually SUPPOSED to do and received the same raise as a co-worker who didn't do any of the extra work. Verbally you will receive some praise but overall you work hard for nothing.
good,You have a winning chance with advancement and opportunity if you are a young adult graduating college.  
good,"Compensation and benefits are ""good"". Culture and values leave more to be desired (no discipline for insubordination). Job security and advancement are not likely. management lacks tremendously because communication is often times non existent or avoided altogether."
good,"Improved customer interaction skills as daily merchandising requires talking to customers, answering questions and meeting their needs with regard to Coca Cola products. Time management was an important tool as merchandising activities needed to be performed at multiple locations on a daily basis. I used a creative mind to launch displays attracting customers while working alongside fellow merchandisers."
good,Great Benefits and Compensation but The management team is horrible.
good,"fun job, but physically exhausting with long hours few holidays and weekend work."
good,The money and over time are well worth the work but there is no job security what-so-ever. Management like to remind its employees that they are replaceable.
good,"A typical day at work consists of slow and fast periods of work. In production, machines are fairly easy to learn but preventive maintenance should be done more often. Part-time employees are being used to reduce overtime with little opportunity to go full-time or advance. The 2nd shift can be unpredictable as to what time you will get off. Management is alright but dont believe parttime workers is favorable for this type of industry. Eventually will end up with retirees and students. Hardest part can be hours and long periods of downtime, the most enjoyable is coworkers. I work with alot of great people of different languages and cultures. Pay is great if you get enough hours."
good,"You need to have very thick skin to work here as you are constantly being told what you have done wrong, how unproductive you are and how bad you suck at your job."
good,I enjouy working for the company and have a desire to continually grow. I love what Coca-Cola stand for. I enjoy knowing that I have job stability and they I work for a reputable company.
good,"Coca-Cola is a global-brand that will never go away, and is large across the board. CCE is now in charge of all western Europe operations of Coke, and Coca-Cola Refreshments (CCR) is now focused on US operations for Coke and various other subsidiaries. That being said, my experiences are with CCR."
good,working with regular customer whom I developed a relationship with
good,"Wake up early in the morning around 4am sometimes working 12 hours a day then having to wake up at 4am again the next morning to do the same thing, The management is excellent they seem to care about how you feel and try to work with you if you have a situation that comes up. You mostly work alone and you only meet your co workers during company meetings. The hardest part of the job is having to work during the summer when stores have huge sales on soda during the summer holidays. The most enjoyable part is the amount of freedom that you get."
good,Management cared only about each other.Worked inside and out. Worked on weekends and holidays.Hardest part of job was meeting ever changing quota's. Enjoyed going homeand relaxing.
good,"Talking with my customer making sure everything is ok,and going over orders with Store Manager."
good,"les objectifs  commerciaux ne sont pas smart,pas assez decontact avec la vente. trop de visites pour peu de retour business;"
good,No very concerned with employees.  Didn't feel very comfortable there at all.  If you were management you were good but otherwise you were a non important employee
good,Purchased independent bottlers and then changed to Coca-Cola Refreshments where they then sold the independent bottlers to franchise. You cannot work for Coca-Cola Enterprises in the same capacity.
good,I worked for this company for 25 years and then was made redundant by the incompetent management of east Kilbride I have no issues with the coca cola company but myself and others were made redundant because we did not agree with everything the management said I was very very good at my job and wanted to learn new machinery and get better skills but the management marked me down and said the opposite so if you take a job in this plant be aware of the management who should not be in the positions they are in and tell lies all the time.
good,"Long days of work, with good compensation and great benefits. I always had work to do in one account or another. The job was very high pace and the time flew, but it was stressful at times."
good,"The Call Centre is Peterborough is a lovely place to work, the people are very friendly and welcoming.  There is however little opportunity for progression within the call centre.  There are many opportunities to develop in role, but should you wish to progress in your career, you would need to relocate."
good,"Pay started on the low side and continued to even with raises - never met industry standard.  Large corporation so decisions made at corporate level not always in alignment with possibilities at the regional level.  Beholden to stockholders, almighty $ was number one priority, if a quarter didn't meet expectations head count reduction was the solution - years of loyalty, experience, and effort had zero impact on who went or stayed - all decided by metrics."
good,"Out of College working for CCE! Great Opportunity to be with a company a very long time.  But all good things must come to an end.  New management destroyed great team of folks, battered and beat down.  Inconsistent direction and simply ineffective management styles - actually told we were replaceable and simply numbers on a page by a superior once..."
good,A job that was physical and kept you moving. You got to meet many different types of people dealing with customers. I learned customer relations through this job.
good,"Good hours, days, weekends off plus all holidays.  Pay is pretty good, $23/hr to start but manager is really really bad.  Very rude and condescending person who only cares about himself and has a split personality. Not acountable or approachable unless higher ups are visiting then he's sooo nice to everyone. It's too bad this person ruins it for everyone else because it is a fun place to work. There are 2 managers now and the new one is more professional but his hands are tied because the old manager is a nut case and is playing games behind his back."
good,Hours are very flexible. Reasonable time off and bonuses. Compensation for your vehicle. Over all not a bad company to work for.
good,My job is very laborious. You have to work hard to keep your job and excel. You have to be very outgoing. I learned how to operate a forklift and a vertique style warehouse system. some of my co-workers work harder than others. Getting through really heavy days can be tough but it only makes you better. The most enjoyable part of my job is when we do a great job we are rewarded with food.
good,">It is a fast paced working in a warehouse, basically same routine scheduled daily."
good,"Coca-Cola Enterprises is one of the biggest franchisees in Coke system.  It engages in bottling production and delivery to end customers."
good,"Consistent, but you'll never make that much money.  Typically you'll have a 9 hour day.  The hardest part of the job is the constant barrage of projects that you have going."
good,"Coca Cola has great benefits and great pay. But the major thing that their lacking is horrible management and life style outside of work. They can work you 16 hr shifts, several days out of the week. They don't give you much of a notice, and don't care about your life outside of work."
good,"Shift work, days, nights and weekends. 12-hour shifts (6am - 6pm or 6pm - 6am)."
good,Great work environment. Great team-oriented employees to work with.
good,great collegues
good,"The Account Manager is the primary contact between large and small store managers or owners. In conjunction, responsible for building customer relationships along with increasing business by selling and ordering products based on customer needs. A typical day will begin around 6am checking reports and reviewing the business itinerary. Throughout the day, sell in incremental displays and equipment placements; sell in promotional programs and ensure customer compliance. In connection with a sales call, maintain appropriate inventory levels company assets and point of sale. As well as, ensuring accounts meet Company merchandising standards, and transmit appropriate order in conjunction with existing geographic sales routes. Day will typically end around 5pm filling out forms and finalizing the day."
good,"I manage Account Managers who call on all Home Market accounts (Supermarkets, Convenience Stores, Drug and Value)"
good,"Typical day at work entails visiting current customers, writing product orders, strategizing and identifying opportunities for growth to improve volume and profit margins for comapny as well as customers. My most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people, establishing and building relationships, and exciting people about future growth."
good,Great organization job demands long hours. Very fast pace business and experiences a lot of personnel change.
good,"I enjoyed working here, but the managers had people that could have career opportunities."
good,"Very productive and physical job. Must be able to lift, pull or push over 50lbs multiple times a day. Must be able to work up to and over 12 hours per day. Able to meet new people on a daily basis."
good,"good people, good air and a great stock room.If the part was not there it would be there in 2 to 3 days."
good,"I learned several different postions at Coca Cola. I learned the system on the accounting side, dispatcher side, & scheduling. I enjoyed the nice office setting that I worked in. My co-workers all were team pleayers and my supervisor was very helpful."
good,"I enjoyed working at Coca-Cola Enterprises. However, the pay was not reasonable."
good,Responsible for supervising the warehousing and shipping of incoming and outgoing materials. Supervises warehouse personnel.
good,"A typical day at Coca-Cola is logging onto the computer and transfer daily routes to a POD for loaders to print pick tickets out for orders that have to be built. Then I will count the product which the loaders have put on a skid to verify that the correct amount of product is going out to our customers. After that it is time to start moving trucks around to the dock to be loaded, and in the middle of all that I have drivers coming in which I have to check in what product they have brought back and make sure the monies that they have collected through out the day gets deposited into the safe."
good,"good work, poor communication at times, low mileage pay, decent company needs improvement overall."
good,"Coca-Cola was a fun place to work!! I got paid pretty well and enjoyed my position!! Always had consecutive days off and and the stores that I merchandised were generally fun to be at. I ended up leaving because I never got to see my family!! My wife and I had a whole 2 days off together when I worked there and that led me to leave. Great place to work if you're single, not so much if you're married, at least as a merchandiser."
good,"An sich macht der Job Spaß, doch die Umstände sind nicht gerade toll. Man hat so viele Themen auf dem Zettel, die man am Besten alle gleichzeitig abarbeiten soll. Wenn man etwas nicht schafft oder etwas nicht läuft, wie es sich das Unternehmen vorstellt, muss man sich gleich dafür rechtfertigen. Coca-Cola verdient immer mehr Geld und gibt sich nie zufrieden damit. Jedes Jahr muss es noch eine Schippe mehr sein. Aber die Mitarbeiter werden natürlich nicht am Gewinn beteiligt."
good,"open and close accounts, send repair services to customers, sell new products, send merchandise to customers, management was helpful and fair, it was very relaxed working their, you could wear hats, get up and get free drinks"
good,"The company is currently restructuring, may not be very reliable. Insurance rates seem to increase annually. The company was great during my first 7 years but steadily started to decline over the years."
good,"Okay company to work for.  Employees were nice and mgmt was generally fair.  Building was old and cold, needed updates and improvements to the building."
good,"Company runs very established and cost-effective management"
good,Coke was a job I will never forget.  We were paid by commission so it taught me to be aware of my time spent. Waisted time could and did cost me money.
good,"I worked here as a merchandiser while in college.  It was a good job.  Then became a route driver, then a sales rep, and ultimately an account manager.  Good company but comp was horrible."
good,The opportunity to grow is there. I started as a sales rep and moved to a supervisor position within 1.5 years. After 2 years in that position moved to a position in HR. I loved working here and if my position had not been eliminated I would still be there.
good,"new company just took over, should be ok after all is settled. Great products and benefits. plenty of work on a daily basis no matter what role you are in"
good,When we were family owned it was a great place to work. We were treated like we were part owners. In 2001 we were bought out by CCE Coca Cola Enterprises who after 3 years of updating our computer systems.started downsizing. Back then they tried to make the Chicago market change to there national business plan which was a big mistake. Chicago is unique and always will be.
good,"Working at Coca Cola European Partners brings with it a fast paced environment which brings a new exciting challenge each day, a recommended place to work!"
good,"You get out what you put in good company to work for it is hard word. Good pay insurance is fair medical, dental, vision,an life paid vacation depends on your years of service"
good,During my time I enjoyed my time there working. I enjoyed being out into the field and out of the office. I learned forklift skills there and warehouse skills as well.
good,"Built orders from verbal commands by head-set and from pick sheets, moved product from receiving to build area using a forklift and operated a layer picker for order fill efficiency."
good,I have never worked for Coca-Cola European Partners it was still Coca-Cola Enterprises when I worked there so I really cannot give you an accurate review.
good,I appreciate the opportunities and experiences with Coca-Cola.  I learned a great deal about management and corporate structure.  I always have fun and make the best of every opportunity.
good,"The finance department of Coca-Cola Enterprises relocated to Florida, as such, I did not remain with the company too long to be able to rate their company fairly."
good,Learned how to drive double forked lift here. The hours were abundant so was the work nothing that i could not handle. Side load selector as well as bulk. Learned allot from these group of warehouse veterans.
good,"I loved working for Coca-Cola, started there when I was 19 years old.  I've met many good people while being employed by them and I enjoyed working for them for many years."
good,"Started working at 6:30 am and ended at 3 pm. When I first started had to prepare documents for scanning and then moved on to indexing, data entry and scanning. Management was ok."
good,A typical work day would include  visiting Coca Cola    customers on a regular schedule to  order product-  go over   marketing programs  - strategies to improve the customers  profit with help from Coke product-address any issues promptly
good,"-long days "
good,"Responsible for ordering, maintaining product availability and merchandising products at all designated accounts. Job Responsibility (Corporate) - Manage each assigned outlet through face to face customer service. - Ensure no foreign product in Division owned equipment. - Manage inventory levels at assigned customer accounts using hand held equipment. - Execute point of sale. - Sell new brands and additional product to established customers. - Ensure product rotation, and process damages."
good,"I come into work & turn my coworkers computers on & get right to work with little small talk with my coworkers when they arrive for a few moments. Each day can be a different form the previous day. With having to answer phone calls, emails, IM messages, & more from my techs, techs supervisors, & other employee's I've become a better multitasking person along with having to make hard decisions in difficult situations. The part I do enjoy are my coworkers with being able get to know one another & form that good workmanship relation but having a down said to that is not all coworkers work has hard, care for the job, or knowledge about the job or workplace. Which leads to some poor management issues which can make the job harder at times along with those other issues."
good,"Die Arbeitszeit ist flexibel. Home Office ist möglich."
good,The benefits which this company provides were very good. The workload and expectations were a bit overwhelming at times but they were manageable.
good,"This is a large company with great benefits, and some great advancement opportunities. The one negative aspect with this company was the unrealistic work expectations."
good,"had several jobs at CCE, was always a chance to advance with career. Company gave chance to receive CDL.The physical labor demand was hard on the body.,"
good,"Fun workplace with supportive management, felt like a family. Gained a lot of experience in the manufacturing/production industry."
good,"enjoyable place to look for a job, great opportunities for a longterm career."
good,Very crazy environment in the bottling section. Hectic but very busy.
good,"A typical day at work included pre-trip duties (inventory checking on the truck; delivering product and fulfilling orders to various locations) and post-trip duties."
good,They keep their employees busy. Good management. They are willing to listen to questions and concerns and adjust accordingly.
good,Büyük mmarkaların yönetimine tanıklık etmek öğreticiydi.
good,Learned information about product that I never thought I would.
good,shipping products to different companies in the united states in a timely manner
good,It was a very fast paced and the management was decent. Co-workers were very childish and immature. The job itself wasn't to hard and I liked getting paid every week
good,I learned a lot through all my years at this job.  There was a lot to learn and I am glad for the knowledge.
good,"This jobs is as good or as bad as you make it, I am lucky enough to make it positive I have a great territorry with great customers"
good,"•	Order product and fill shelves for local grocery stores"
good,I used my skillsat Coca-Cola when an Active Directory project kept being declined and was an absolute MUST to complete.  We planned a PR Campaign that informed senior management about the project and the importance of securing the proper budget and resources to move forward.  Our campaign was so successful that we were requested to do the same project for Coca-Cola World-wide rather than the division of Coca-Cola Refreshments.
good,Too much stress. Workers rely on seniority position to get advancemt.
good,"compensation is good, but overall the management team is not up to par. Daily duties are much more difficult to complete than they need to be. With proper leadership and accountability, this would be an ideal place to work."
good,"Building work orders for customers and ensuring merchandise was loaded to bulk trucks for delivery. I learned how to effectively operate a forklift. It was fun competing with co-workers on a nightly basis for the top order builder spot. Hardest part of the job was maintaining the same speed for 10-12 hours, five days a week."
good,good job but lack of chance for promotion. pay was good and daily activities are physical.
good,"Through my experience in this ever-diversifying industry, I have learned that I must quickly comprehend difficult tasks with little oversight or direction. It is my responsibility to achieve maximum sales goals by providing the most effective distribution of products to my client base which consists of large food chains as well as smaller businesses. Knowledge and promotion of new product sales is of great importance.  In addition, developing a successful ongoing relationship with current customers will help to grow my existing customer base."
good,"a typical day at work"
good,I worked for CCE for about a year and a half and I have never encountered such poor management.  My district manager would frequently cuss employees and talk down to them.  Would not recommend this Company.
good,Fun people and very knowledgable.  Traveling was a great experience and getting to know the different projects was helpful
good,Account managing for a specific region in long island.  Upsold existing clients of our products.  
good,"Supervise a small team, targeting, production efficiencies, yeilds, plan in essential maintenance on target to ensure mechanical efficiency is reached. I have learned to manage a section of a  hi speed production line and manage break relief. I feel my co-workers can rely on me for any aspect of the job due to my experience and length of time in my position. The hardest part of my job is having to train inexperienced operators, whilst still performing my own tasks. However I enjoy passing on my knowledge and experience to new colleges and find it personnally rewarding, ensuring all procedures are adhered too. The most satisfying part of the job is seeing everything fall into place smoothly, and reaching my required production targets"
good,"Great Place to build Teamwork skills, strong sales capabilities, and sales experience. The team departments are more like family.  "
good,Upper management lacked leadership skills. Too many accounts per sales person.
good,"On a daily basis Im responsible for keeping over 40 techinicians in the field busy with critical tickets for customers. I communicate daily with Field supervisors as well as high end customers. Any barriers presented needs to be identified, removed and rectified quickly. I've learned a how to use logistics, gantts and reports. Very proficient in identify issues with work using Gantt data. My superiors and co-workers have various dirverse backgrounds but with great comunnucation skills we all share a common goal of getting customers serviced expeditiously. The hardest part of my job is turning my brain off a the end of the day, sometimes over thinking extra work duties. Sometimes not getting customers scheduled due to tech capacity is hard too. But the job overall I love doing. To build the rapport with the technicians, supervisors plus helping Coca cola reach its daily goals is actually enjoyable, to be able to see how such a huge organization gets to front line customers  and get the product sold for profitt."
good,The work itself was not the issue. Highly enjoyed the job but couldn't tolerate the behaviors of certain co-workers. Made it difficult to manage and balance both work and life. Management was not bad though but focused their attention on the wrong views of what needed to be done and not the main picture. Overall not a bad place to work if you a single young person with no kids. 
good,"Every day I woke up early to check my phone and would have three different stores to travel to. When I got to my stores, I would have to check shelves and coolers to see what needed filled. I pulled pallets out of the backrooms that came from the deliveries and stocked the shelves/coolers. After merchandising, I would have to use a stacker to then stack the pallets neatly so more deliveries could fit in the back. I worked alone and barely saw management or co-workers. The hardest part of the job was being fast and accurate at the same time. The most enjoyable part was being payed well and was still able to travel while being in a union."
good,"Inventory of truck"
good,"Operating electric pallet jack, building pallets with mixed beverages of varies sizes and stage them for shipping, load them onto trucks for upcoming deliveries"
good,"Forever changing environment.  Very knowledgable work force."
good,"Daily repair of soda vending machines,Learning all of repair of vending equipement.very poor leadership in management.Good co-workers to work with.No communication with managementwhich made job hard.Fixing customer problems was most enjoyable."
good,"Meeting new people everyday and introducing new products and promotions. I learned to manage time and to work effectively. My co-workers are great because they deal with the same things I deal with everyday so they can sympathize with me and also give me suggestions to deal with difficult customers or just assist me if I had a question. They hardest thing about my job is time management. It is easy to spend all day out meeting stores, talking to managers, rotating product and watching dates but knowing what is important so you can meet the other stores on my route that day. The most enjoyable thing is the flexibility about my job. I work when I want and I am done when I meet all the stores I have to in a given day."
good,Coca-Cola offers several learning opportunities in regards to merchandising their product.
good,Have to learn corporate culture. A lot of social differentials.
good,Stay busy all day with plenty of work to be done. Learned plenty of new technology and mechanical equipment quickly. Many co workers lack motivation. Hardest part of job is keeping equipment working properly due to little downtime. Plant runs 6-7 days per week.
good,"I built sales displays and stocked merchandise. I occasionally made sales, which I was supposed to be earning sales gifts. The sales manager kept them for himself. Other than that, it was a great experience."
good,"I started with Coca-Cola as a Driver filling vending machines. The work was physical but very slow during winter months. I transferred to Merchandising which was even more physically challenging but very steady year round. Unfortunately after a recent strike I noticed the entire atmosphere of the company had changed. So while I was definitely glad to have worked there, I am a much happier person now that I no longer work there."
good,Great opportunity to relocate nationally. Learned a lot from various departments.
good,soda distribution.....yah didn't excite me. The atmosphere and job was not a fit for me
good,"Sales-driven environment, room for growth, professional colleagues."
good,Overall good experience. Many opportunities to grow and learn.
good,"Fast paced, 6 day work weeks that were supposed to land me a permanent job at the end of the summer......."
good,Run fork trucks to move product and build pallets with specific items
good,"Meet the corporate numbers, that was a typical day. It did not matter how long you had to work or what you had to do as long as you meet the set quota."
good,Fast Paced
good,More worried about protection of the brand than employees. Good workers and technical staff at the local level. Always changing priorities and systems. the most enjoyable part of the job was working for the most recognized brand in the world.
good,Doing your basic Preventive Maintenance on semi tractors and trailers. I worked 3rd shift so thats all I really had to do. Did some corrective maintenance but not much. And there was one other co-worker with me and he was fun and easy to get along with.
good,"Everyday at Coca Cola Refreshments, Inc. is exciting. There is diverse coroporate culture that assist the company in different theories. There is never a dull or boring moment. I learned many facets of the consumer beverage & food industry and had a chance to display my skill sets on business projects to assist the company in reaching their 2020 vision."
good,"It's a great plce to work if you like long hours and have the ability to work with little supervision. the downside is that if yu do not deliver items that are on the manifest, reagrdless of whether they were in the truck or not, the cost of those items will be deducted from your check. this is a salary based job with no overtime pay. you work til the job is done, not just 8 hours a day."
good,Coca-Cola offers a great portfolio of brands and packages.
good,"Started at 6am ,working convenience,independent grocery ,mass and bulk super. How to help increase my customers sales,merchandise our product and sale in new items to meet speed to market goals. Got along really well with co-workers i considered most of them good friends. Hardest part, i wanted my customers to be happy but sometime i think we were not flexible to there needs. Been out with people."
good,worked in a good entry level role.
good,"ok company to work for, it's a sales position so if your not a good seller don't apply"
good,the work days in the money room are very long and demanding but the people are nice!!!
good,"A typical day at work consists of pre shift meeting. Monitor inventory levels on a daily basis. Ensure the warehouse has proper staffing. Monitor picking accuracy of the order builders. Check Kronos on a daily basis. Proper replenishments in the slots are being followed. Following up with fellow team members on projects. I learned how to implement voice pick. The hardest part of the job I would say is not seeing my family on a consistent basis. Working 13-16 hour days on a consistent basis is hard to spend some family time. The most enjoyable part of the job are the people are work with, their hard workers, motivated, and always willing to learn new things to benefit themselves and as and develop growth within the company."
good,"Really fun place to work at, everything revolves around familiy."
good,"Overall, this is a good company to work for, however there has been a recent trend of promoting new hires and passing over the veterans. This is causing a massive exodus from the long term employees."
good,"When all is said and done, it's not about the people, the place, the politics, or the warm fuzzies. It's all about the bottom line."
good,"The staff were great to work with, but they were always creating reactive fires that had to be put out asap."
good,Never a shortage of things to do. Ample variety of work tasks and great people to work with.
good,"keine Rutine, viele Herausforderungen, die Lösungen für die Problemen ohne Vorgaben, Als Bibel die CORE Anforderungen."
good,"I enjoyed my time here. I worked with some knowledgeable people and augmented my commercial skills. "
good,Got to work early in the morning. At that time we were given our assignments for the day. Co workers very friendly and helpful. Overtime was granted if delivery truck was late. When truck arrives help unload truck and stock the merchandise carefully and neatly. The job called for me to stock shelves and build displays.
good,"A heavily focused sales job working for a large drinks distribution company in the london area. Field based, so you will be somewhere different everyday, meeting new clients and liaising with your team. Using a company phone, laptop and car, you will record data from local businesses who stock CCE products in order to keep progression statistics of the companies growth."
good,My hours was nice love my job but the company kept change things.  It got so bad the company will have meeting every week and will change one thing to another when we haven't did the change that they have said to do for the last week.  This went on for 8 months until I left.
good,"worked for this company for over 20 years.started from the bottom and worked in several different departments,traveling twos hours a day to and from work is putting to much stress on my family."
good,employees easy to get along and supervisors nice place to work learn patients and accountability hardest part of the job loading and unloading most enjoyable part is pay
good,"This is a very fast pace job.  You need to be a self starter, organized and have great customer service skills. I have learned to be very flexible because my job duties and location can change from day to day."
good,"I was in charge of growing Coca-Cola range, space etc in 200 stores across Leicestershire. I had to work to strict targets and to manage my own daily diary."
good,Very good leadership at the Plant level.  Job Culture was one of survival of the fittest and holiday volumes were challenging.  The most enjoyable part of the job was making the month - the most challenging was the holiday season.
good,Great people to work with. The non union side if you work hard you are rewarded with good raises and nice bonuses. Good benefits and pension and RRSP program.
good,"Great company to work for overall.  Good culture and encourages growth, Encourages work like balance.  Learned a lot."
good,"Typical Day = give staff daily work, touch base with CCNA (Corp), worked aging rpts, worked w/NE Sales Ctrs to reduce errors"
good,"Le site de Fresnes a été vendu par l'entreprise mais était situé dans un environnement très agréable près des pépinières de la ville de Paris. "
good,"No life. Didn't have a family life. Pay was very good, co-workers were very enjoyable.  Coke 24/7."
good,Mede door huidige economische situatie veelal interne focus en retail gedreven. Gedreven teams en zeer dynamisch landschap.
good,le plus difficle dans ce poste était le nombre de kilomètre fait par jour .
good,très bon selon son manager. Création d'une cohésion d'équipe forte
good,"My time with Coca Cola was positive overall.  "
good,Very fun place to work with good work life balance. Received a company car and was able to complete work in a timely manner
good,I was with CCE for nearly 3 years and my responsibilities did not increase.
good,"Your days seem like they never end."
good,Meet the coustomer and install machine.Sometimes deal with nasty kitchens.The best part is seeing the coustomer being happy when you finished the job.
good,"Daily sales calls to exsisting customers to capture their soft drink requirements. Discussing any promotions and selling in new products available."
good,"A typical day at work would include traveling to a set amount of Large stores and fulfilling those store managers requirements.  Merchandisers are required to service store by filling designated shelves and set displays.  "
good,"I was responsible for all record shipment data; damages, accounting, charges, available space ect. All items had to be packed and sealed for preparation for shipping. All carriers had to be contacted and arranged for next shipment. Coca Cola inc. taught me order and responsibility. All orders had to be correct and ready for shipment no matter what."
good,"Driving city to city delivering soda to customers."
good,"•	Managed a parts inventory of approximately 1 million dollars and maintained a monthly purchasing budget between 50K and 200K dollars."
good,coke is not a bad place o work. only bad thing is the management .
good,A typical at work would be clock-in at 630 from a pay phone at your designated store. I learned the value of presentation in grocery stores will take your product to a different level as far as sales. The Management was unfair in some ways. Management showed favoritism to some employees and it was noticeable. For me it was a problem at some stores because the employee before me would not keep the coke-cola section clean. So the hardest part was cleaning and organizing the back warehouse before it was time to actually start my day off. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing and meeting new and different people everyday. An when your stores were finish you was finish.
good,"Been at the company for a year, and honestly enjoy working there... most of the time. The center is vibrant, diverse, and energetic. The benefits include 4 weeks of paid vacation, 3 floating holidays, ample sick time, etc. However, 3 missed punches and you're outta there! You get docked if you call in for an unplanned sickness. And, there's hardly room for upward growth. Considering it's a call center for a multi-million dollar company, the position is better than average."
good,"Go store to store, stock shelves and build displays.I would work 6 days a week,10-12 hrs a day and every weekend. Still I liked the work and I only left for more money and far less hours."
good,"Working with Coca-Cola it takes a special person, the reason I say this is because you must be a highly motivated and able to unsupervised. I start my days at 7 a.m. and finish at 4 or 5p.m.. The senior employees are very helpful, however there is always change so you have to be versatile to change."
good,"working long hours and having to go help others,merchandising,co-workers are great people,"
good,It's fun to meet new people without have your supervisory breathing down your back all day. Building display that are higher then me.
good,I felt like it was a great working environment despite the lack of advancement.
good,"Das sollte jeder für sich selber endscheiden, jeder hat eine andere Auffassung, aber Absprachen sollten eingehalten werden."
good,"l'activité commerciale s'articule autours de 3 poles a réaliser en magasin :  1 Acte de vente + 1 acte de Merchandising+1 reporting "
good,I was with this company for eight long years.  I worked hard everyday.  I enjoyed the work.  The pay was decent as well.  My only problem was that I was never granted an opportunity for advancement when I clearly met all criteria.  I left the company due to being over looked continuously.
good,"Had the pleasure of working for CCE Ltd for ten years, in that time the business underwent many changes to its management team and policies within. It once had a very good reputation for employment and was a sort after job or career. Unfortunately some roles within the network where to be made redundant as third party was a more viable approach to carry the brand forward."
good,travel store to store stock shelves help customers and interact with management
good,"Up at 4am to drive 100+ miles to first account returning home anywhere from 6-7pm. Management is strong, co workers you only see on meeting days. Hardest thing about the job never knowing when work is over and trying to have a healthy home life."
good,typical day being a merchandiser. Yo work hard and get paid. not much more to it go from store to store.
good,"Everyday is a different challenge that will keep you busy and motivated to work. You learn many different types of skills that can be used in your everyday life and future career. For example, time management, inventory management, quotas and sales targets etc. Management changed recently and it was nice to see how fast the company can adapt to the new styles. The hardest part of the job was the change however and the new ""micro-management"" style that they implemented as a result. The most enjoyable however was the freedom to work your day as you please. There is no boss hanging over your shoulder all day. If you deliver results, they will reward you."
good,"The position I worked had stressful moments due to a lot of things being out of your control.store managers get very upset with you if someone else from the company is not doing they're job right,so overall just keep a positive attitude and work hard and sooner or later you'll be rewarded."
good,"Vous êtes en début de poste, on vous affecte sur une ligne de production (conditionnement), vous prenez la relève et c'est parti pour 8 heures. Vous gérez vous même la ligne. Lorsqu'un arrêt ce produit, vous devez vous débrouillé seul, ou faire appel à la maintenance ( et là, ça dépend avec l'équipe que vous travaillez). Surveillance de la ligne, contrôle qualité, rapport rédactionnel... Tout ce que fait un opérateur de production. J'ai travailler chez eux en Interim. C'était plutôt bien et ça s'arrête là. Si vous avez l'occasion d'y travailler, vous comprendrez par vous même. "
good,"A typical day is holding a pre-shift meeting to employees. Discussing new policy, customer requests ,safety,and updated injuries. Then its on to the safety/OTIF meeting. After that its observations ride a longs."
good,"A typical day at Coca Cola went fairly well, sometimes not enough time in the day to complete all assigned tasks. I did learn how to manage working with union employees without difficulties. Managment sometimes looks at the sales department as the only department. I really enjoyed getting to know other co-workers some have become good friends. The toughest part of the job was giving an employee a written warning or terminating someone. The most enjoyable part of job was the people by far."
good,Great company just pay was not exceptable. Good location but needed newer trucks to drive.
good,Its an independant workforce and values alot of the companies creed and missions of success for their customers. They have a good pay rate but the hours arent plentiful for each employee
good,Processed garnishments for internal employees. Worked with a well established team and manager.
good,"Coca Cola Ent was an ok place to work. There pay was average for a  warehouse but it's also half factory that produces the beverages that go into the warehouse part. There are 5 machines involved in the production process of making and filling the beverage containers produced(coke,monster,tab,dr.pepper ect. The work is not hard on the factory side with the machines. The order pullers on the warehouse side had the harder/hotter area to work in. It equals out i quess because they make more pay on that side do to lifting and loading cases of coke products onto there forklifts by hand. Benefits are above average there once you meet the high deductibles."
good,excellent experience salaire motivant est bonne ecole du travail
good,Coca-Cola European Partner offre une culture d'entreprise très intéressante. Les opportunités d’expériences et d’évolutions sont  très importantes.
good,"Verifying bank statements from customer receipts and bank deposits "
good,"a typical work consist of fast pace work enviroment i got along with my co -workers some what good,the hardest thing about the job is the training and learning your job the most enjoyable job was the lunch break"
good,Benefits are great. 3 weeks of vacation after 1 year.  Management needs improvement.  Has slowly pulled away from employee appreciation.  This has decreased employee moral greatly.
good,good place to work/ time goes by fast because u are too busy to look at a clock
good,11 hours daily
good,"promocionar los productos, aprendí a formar la promociones y pegar los folletos en lugares estratégicos, buenos jefes, colegas simpaticos, el horario de trabajo eran de muchas horas, era entretenido dejar las promociones en los negocios y se pasaba rápido el dia."
good,Good insurance. Maintenance dept management changes very often. The maintenance crew works against each other sometime.
good,"Frustrating management team, sometimes little support. Good development business. Face fitting culture. Great team environment everyday. Options for health care."
good,Coca Cola was an awesome place to work.  I really enjoyed working with all different people with different backgrounds and education all over the world.
good,"Loved the people I worked with rather than the management. I performed multiple job duties even when I was not asked too. The atmosphere of the workplace was good, there was great teamwork."
good,"On a typical day, I would deliver up to 6 stores a day and merchandise. This job had the same routine daily. The hardest part of the job was building heavy displays with the product. The easiest part of the job was meeting new people in different stores while building relationships with store management."
good,"Typical day of pallet repair, pallet transfer, bottle machine labeling and bottle transfer. There was a set schedule of what needed to be done on the shift. I learned how to work with people, stay focused on my work during a shift and work fast. The management was always engaged with the work and kept you working. The co-workers were great people who made sure everything got done. The hardest part was the physical labor and fixing problems when things went wrong. The most enjoyable part was working with people."
good,"Coca-Cola has changed a lot since I left but it used to be a great job. They stalk you now using Google Earth and Blackberry phones with GPS so that there is no ""down"" time for you where you used to have freedom and no pressure but the good thing is job security. Coca-Cola isn't going anywhere anytime soon. It's a bit aggressive on your body after a while but overall it's a good job. I really have no complaints about the company and miss it from time to time."
good,Great Coworkers. You would love it. Most people do. Coca Cola is a beverage giant.
good,great place for testing lab skills and fun place to work. Fun people
good,"Nice friendly environment, with good people to work with. Great opportunity with room for advancements if you meet their qualifications and expectations. Opportunities for transfers with excellent benefits."
good,Overall this is a great job and company to work for the other employee's are great to work with and very helpful. If i ever have a question management is there to answer the question or point me in the right direction. The work is very physical but if no were close to impossible. The hardest part of the job is just learning all the different products and sizes. The most enjoyable part of the job is working along side people that enjoy what they do and take pride in their work. They let me know up front that the warehouse would be closing in less then a year and being moved to a different town and that there would be a chance to transfer if willing to travel.
good,Anyone hiring in with Coca Cola at this time would be subject to their downsizing and layoffs. This company spoils you for the 'real' working world environment with benefits and compensations. I loved working with my team members and my manager. They were a great group of people and Coca Cola celebrates diversity with gusto!
good,"I learned at from working at Coca-Cola Enterprises how to take in bound and outbound calls, make sells for the product and more."
good,"Coca-Cola Refreshments is a great company to be a part of, and it will become one of the Greatest company that ever existed. There is a operational feel of a family unit on the floor, with workers that have heart and dedication in all that they do. As large as the company is, it is surprising to experience that ""we are family"" feel. Yes, there are the conflicts that typically happen in any family unit, but when all is said and done, everybody is supportive of each other and what they do. The Spirit of Coke is in the mind and forefront of every body and what is practiced. That Spirit is inherently present in the environment, and is apparent and transparent in all that is striven for, which is to do the greatest possible good for every thing and every situation no matter how small and insignificant or large and public something is.There are still many walls to take down, but as stated as one of the Coke's core Values, which is ""to be constructively discontent,"" the status quo will give way to change that inherently perpetuates that good is not enough, the best is the baseline, and great is the ultimate objective. I Love the people of this company and what they stand and strive for."
good,mi avaluacion es que aprendi muchooo la parte deficil fue a lo primero sungo que era hasta que le agarre el ritmo al trabajo despues nada cada uno hacia su trabajo 
good,"Typical day driving to stores filling shelves and coolers,diving to multiple stores all over town."
good,"Long hours. plethora of knowledge due to the amount of training and education provided. Many different management styles, some good some not so good. Co-workers are very proactive and always willing to help. Hardest part of the job is keeping customers in compliance."
good,"long hours, bad management, great co-workers, great benefits"
good,Run Machinery to produce Coca-Cola Products. Lots of OT and seven days a week. Equipment runs very well.
good,"tough job but the pay is great and the benefits are better. job will make a man out of you. limited home time but a set schedule. management has no clue whats going on. policy changes every day. "
good,I left only for advancement because there was very little room for advancement without moving to a big job market. If i were in a different job market i would reconsider rejoining them
good,"Great place to have a career. Your summer is gone. You are forced to work overtime if you are the low man in seniority. That's 4hrs every day, if needed. Safety meetings are numerous. If the management likes you, your ok. If they don't, write-up after write-ups. Outside of that, this is a great company to have a career. I'm done and I've moved on to a new company as a manager."
good,"I oversaw 2 Production lines during a 10 hour shift, the relationship between the production crew and the lab was very good."
good,"typically I'm involved in sales my entire day, but customer service is also a huge daily responsibility. I've learn how to sale in success to every type of customer that's in my area. my co-workers and being number in sales 2 years in a row are the most enjoyable parts of my job and there are no hard parts because I've had years of selling experience before coke."
good,trabajar en almacen cargar y descarcar los trailer y manejar un centro de cange de mermas
good,Loved the job but didnt like working with the people there.Alot of snitching going on.People get a way with murder.The people that work get more work and the people that dont do nothen get less work figure that out.Somebody is always watching somebody.
good,"Visited accounts and potential accounts to increase or gain more volume.  I would cold call potential new customers, service existing customers, oversee new installations of equipment, presentations to large new accounts to key people, and complete required paperwork and follow through. The hardest part of the job was collaborating with other departments to keep what was agreed with customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning everyday on the job and working to exceed quotas. Getting my MBA through Coca-cola's paid education."
good,"documentation and and maintenance all fleet equipment from electric pallet jacks, electric and gas engine powered fork lifts,cars pickup trucks , and tractor trailers . perform state vehicle and DOT inspections"
good,A good place to learn warehousing skills. Industry leader trains well.
good,"Challenging work environment but yet rewarding."
good,"You get to work ungoldy hours and your phone never stops ringing.  It is not what you did yesterday to build the company, but what you did today."
good,"Usually perform various activities in addition to my pallet builder job. Some activities would include inventory, checking, and loading/unloading trucks among other duties."
good,I enjoyed working at Coca-Cola Refreshments because they did offer multiple workshops and follow up or review training for their CSR positions. The most difficult part of the job was the demands put on individuals which made your work/life balance difficult at times.
good,trabajo donde conoces mucha gente a diario.convives con todos ellos .y lo mas dificil es cuando te piden apoyo por trabajar con la empresa por vender los productos y no se la puedes dar.
good,A typical day at work at coca-cola was coming in at 6pm gettting the number amount of orders for the day. Replinsh the warehouse and cleaned the warehouse at the end of the night.
good,"most days start at5am. sometimes 3am . need to be a people person ,how to listen and hear their concerns. blessed to have access to my manager and co-workers. work as team when needed thur holidays and sales. hardest part is all the lifting and pulling of product, get your workout from job, very hard on body."
good,"Coca-Cola managers worked as enforcers rather than motivators. In my management experience, I would never talk down to a subordinate but rather talk them up. My goal was to get all the effort that an employee had to offer. If they fell short of their goals, I didn't berate them but rather look for what motivated them to do better for themselves and their company. CCE managers were impatient and weak. I once had a manager tell me that I went for the ""low hanging fruit"" because of the fact that I closed on so many accounts, that it looked to easy. I am effective at what I do because I care about what I do. It represents who I am and effects everyone I interact with. Success breeds success. I worked there in the early 80's and again in 2001. I left them September of that year and have been employed by my current employer for 10 years."
good,My time at Coca-Cola was good overall. I learned a lot about sales and developed my driving and customer service. Over the years you start to see that you are a number and not an individual.
good,I enjoyed the work and the pace of the job however the at the time I was there the pay did not reflect the work that was being done. All in all that was 13 years ago and pay could have gone up to where they are more competitive now
good,I worked for Coca Cola for quite sometime and it changed names 4 times in that span. it was a good company but each time there was a change it seemed like we started all over again.
good,ok place to work nothing special need more guidance from senior managers and seen through. pay is good along with benefits. nice local people clear out needed.
good,I learned how to drive a truck and obtained my CDL. Received very intense training on how to deal with people. Some days were long depending on the route delivery schedule. Overall a good life experience.
good,"Great opportunities, very stressful do to volume, lot of opportunity to learn both in class and online, volume increase substantially when a sale broke."
good,L'ensemble de groupe Coca-Cola est très dynamique dans le travail et sont tous impliqués à l'atteinte des objectifs fixés
good,"Great place to get some decent money and overtime if thats your thing, if you get a permanant job you will probably last a while if careful, if you are a temp, take each day as it comes, grab all the cash you can with as much overtime as possible as it is well paid."
good,"The place offers a lot of training, but the more you know, the more you have to do without even a thank you for extra input. Management officialy invites you to be engaged in company's developement etc, but in my 3 years there I tried and tried and tried. You can't have your own opinions or you wont get anywhere."
good,Enjoyed learning the consultative selling approach and having a direct impact on the growth and revenue of the company.  Great experiences!
good,My job was outsourced to another country.  I enjoyed being there with everyone up until that point.  There were many good aspects to the position.  I hope that many jobs remain in the USA.
good,"Très positif, j'ai été HRBP sur un projet hors norme. Le projet a été une grande réussite"
good,"- komplett eigene Arbeitsorganisation"
good,management was great everyone was willing to teach you or assist you if they where finish with there ticket
good,"Again a lot of lifting and labour work, a very busy role during my shifts but meeting a lot of different people did make the job easier."
good,Great company to work for and great hours and benefits.  Typical day began before 6:00 am and the management was superb.
good,Delivery of Coca Cola product to different stores. Hard working job but can have lots of benefits and can be very profitable.
good,Day began 7 am.  Throughout each day was always different.  My managers were a couple great guys to work for.  Had a way of making things fun.  Hardest part of the job was holiday sales.  The most enjoyable part was seeing any of my team members rewarded for success.
good,A highly structured political corporation where you can be exposed to a wide variety of aspects of the business.  Compensation could be better and people rarely get promoted.  There is a strong bias to hiring external candidates over hiring from within.
good,"Even though this is a very large company, they make you feel like you are a very important piece.  Very fun job"
good,"A typical work day included a morning meeting with my sale manager and team. Arriving to accounts and making sure owner/management was happy with the product we sold. "
good,"A typical day at work starts with sorting out orders and speaking with the management team for any new products or changes. Effective time management is required, being personable and professional in stores. My co-workers are all hard workers easy to get along with. The hardest part of my job was being the middle man when management and customers had disputes. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I had the opportunity to restore broken relationships between management and customers. I learned that customer relationships are one of the most important aspects of my position. Because of my ability to resolve disputes I have received several recognitions from store managers."
good,"I was laid off from CocaCola back in 09.  However, I do feel I gained quite a bit of professional knowledge. Great benefits."
good,"Though this contract leaned more towards the blue-collar end, it was actually quite enjoyable. Management kept communication amongst its employees pretty well and the environment seemed more like a family setting. My only gripe is that the contract was only temporary."
good,"Stay Self-Motivated"
good,"Traveled to various destinations to stock and order product. Learned the layout of routed areas, what product was selling the most in each store. Management was fair in treating everyone equally. Co-workers were friendly and helpful. Hardest part of the job was completing daily timed objectives. Enjoyed the fact of completing those daily objectives."
good,"Polyvalence du poste, travail en équipe, possibilité d'évolution. poste soumis au stress de part les objectifs, manque d'anticipation."
good,A typical day working for Coca-Cola would be fast-paced and demanding.  I perfected my use of the feline device (machine used to place orders).  Management was strict yet open.  The hardest part of the job was the fact that it was demanding and fast-paced.  The most enjoyable part of the job was that I would travel to other locations on a daily basis.
good,Building solid customer relationships and maintaining those relationships through excellent customer service helps build the company in to what it is.
good,"Before the merger in 2011, Coke was a much more enjoyable place to work.  Post-merger, there were so many cut-backs, layoffs, and consolidations of responsibilities, that the environment became toxic.  Morale plummeted.  Among those management people not squeezed out by the realignments, job satisfaction hit an all-time low.  Almost everyone I knew admitted they were actively looking elsewhere.  I resigned after my great job turned into a horrible one.  "
good,Depends upon job role but you can do inside or outside sales. Company is strong and offers a vast array of opportunities. Staff is very diverse. Hours range depending upon role. Most enjoyable part is wearing the Coca Cola logo! 
good,Start the day with a trip to the office to get a game plan going for the day. Learned to communicate with various store managers and salesmen to come together to get a singular job done. Hardest part was driving everywhere. The best part was that hard work paid off. 
good,Very close teams for such a large company.  Great project work with lots of learning opportunities.
good,"J'ai eu la chance d'effectuer une année complète chez Coca Cola Entreprise et qui plus est dans la gestion de la paie. "
good,"-clean mop buckets "
good,"great place to work if the right plant manager was there, ppl were great and helpful "
good,"Durant mon stage j'ai été amené à réaliser des analyses quotidiennement tant avec des indicateurs internes, qu'externes (Nielsen). "
good,I went to different stores and stocked shelves. I also faced product as well as rotate them and receive/ condense load(s)
good,Facilitated the delivery and installation of Coca-Cola Fountain equipment and products for fast food locations.
good,"good place to work, management is very respectful, people are great"
good,"I learned a lot about product presentation and how to interact with customers,"
good,"A typical day during my time at Coca Cola Enterprises involved getting updates from my colleagues completing their shift about the status of various products, expected delivery times, staff on duty amongst others. I then had to go down on the distribution floor to update the inventory boards, keep the shift supervisor updated on all the work orders for the day, and get updated on the crew size present and any changes on the floor for the particular shift. My daily tasks revolved primarily around keeping track of production movement from the production centers, to my distribution location, and down to the various customers."
good,Great place to work. Not much internal advancement opportunity.
good,"I was a merchandiser. The only thing I did not like, was having to wait for the truck on delivery days. It never followed the same route."
good,Large company. Job security is great. Can work anywhere in the US or internationally. Work from home is an option.
good,We performed a full physicall inventory every month end. We counted all raw materials and finished goods daily. We worked 5 or 6 days every week.
good,• Operated department within company objectives
good,"I enjoy interacting with customers and solving their problems. I'm an excellent customer service representative and have been doing this work for 23yrs. I handled about 100 or more calls a day and my manger and supervisor depended on me to get special projects done on time. I've handled all 3rd party accounts such as BJ's, Costco..etc. The most enjoyable part of my job was the people that I met along the way, customers and employees. There was no hard part of the job, I really enjoyed it."
good,I enjoy working in a place where I can make a difference for the company and where the company values my abilities and contributions. I work a 10 to 12 hour day delivering to stores. For the most part management is good; immediate supervisors do their best while being overworked themselves. Most co-workers are frustrated with Coca-Cola becaue their of their lack showing appreciation to their employees. I get along well with my co-workers. The hardest part of of the job is being shorthanded at times. The most enjoyable part of the job is being out driving and delivering to customers.
good,"Gained incredible experience in the soft drink industry. DSD Operations, Customer Management and National Account Leadership."
good,• Managed staff of reset specialists and drivers.
good,"Physically demanding job. Union job, worked large accounts."
good,This was my first expirence as a medical Assistant . and it was fun.
good,A typical day at work:
good,"Busy, production environment. Offers lots of opportunities and room for growth."
good,"I love working with people. Better yet I extremely love working with people at Coca-Cola. I am a great manager and have values and integrity that would never be an issue. My phone book to all employees who work for me union and management alike is open to anyone who would like to cross reference my management style and approach. I am very fair but know that policy is policy and I enjoy the fact that I stay to the path and never stray that gets many in the weeds so to speak. My paths with UPS and Coca-Cola have set a bench mark on what is expected of a great leader at companies so distinguished as these. I have sharpened my style through 11 years of experience in managment and I am ready to step back into the go to person in any situation of an operation or sales experience. I don't lose. Coca-Cola has taught me how to operate without a direct manager to report to, on my own aspect. The hardest part of the job is balancing the issues with the union. Do the right thing and stick to the contract and you will get the reputation of a ""Good Man"" and the union becomes your ally as opposed to your enemy. Work with eachother not against eachother. The most enjoyable part of my job is my crew. They know they have a leader and they can trust him."
good,A great comapny with good benefits. lots of opportunity for growth
good,typical work day is about 10 hours. I learned very good time management. Your co-workers are very helpful.
good,"The company preaches about being for their employees. Not so, supervisors in this area do not set a positive influance to their employees. When I leave I will be taking with me so much that I know I can and will utilize if my future career. I love my co-workers we are a well oiled machine. I think that the hardest part of my job is knowing that my supervisor would be in and we did not know her mood."
good,"Great developmental opportunities, however the work in this particular role was redundant"
good,"A typical day would include a conference call among single divisions of either small store or Large store account managers involving push items, individual route status, promotional updates and progress towards weekly goals."
good,Good in ternship with overall a healthy professional / life balance.
good,"The company did not pay very well, but it was enjoyable and a comfortable place to work. Things have certainly changed with the company at this point."
good,"Avec de la motivation et bcp d'envie, tu peux effectuer plusieurs mission"
good,"Typical day at CCE is a little regimented.  They are ""old school"" in that you expected to be in the office close to 8:00 AM and not leave before 5:00 PM.  The balance then is that there are not a lot of expectations to arrive earlier or stay later so work-life balance is good (depending on travel requirements)"
good,Une bonne expérience dans l'usine de Coca-cola france à Grigny (France) en tant qu'opérateur de ligne. Travail en 3-8 pas simple tous les jours mais bon salaire en prime..Travail temporaire sur une mission de 18 mois sans embauche en fin de mission (prévue dans le contrat initial).
good,"Coke is a product that sales it self, which made the job easier to deliver. So you did""nt have to say much just pull in delivery the soda, You bust your butt in return you were rewarded for it. That one thing i can say back than we were reward well for doing are job. you bust your tail, but at the end its worth it"
good,"Great people, great environment, have worked here over 15years and would love to retire.  The only downfall is that it can be very political and hard to move up in certain spaces."

good,A good group of people who live in an economy getting more and more out of reach.
good,"I have been working in Coke for 4 years. I worked for 2 different teams"
good,"Coke is starting to pay better since C.C.R. took over but their established drivers still make less per hour than trainees at Pepsi.  Its a good place to get your feet in the door and decide if this type of physical work is for you. Benefits are strong because Coke is such a big company."
good,"Overall, good people to work with. However, they create more work than one person can handle. Most of the time, you're chasing a moving target."
good,This job was demanding and stressful at times but a great job. Learned different positions and how to enhance productivity.
good,The pay should be better for Account Managers. Plus they prefer to hire people from outside the company for higher positions.
good,Good job. Work was on a harder level so don't think pull up and drop. But very enjoyable.
good,great company to work for except the pay isn't great. mgt are great people and will help you in any way they can.

Responsible for various HR functions including managing confidential files, entering data into payroll system, and assisting management with payroll related issues."
good,When I first started I only wanted to work as a part-time employee but I was convinced the schedule would work and not be too demanding. After I started my first week consisted of 70+ hours of work which is not what I wanted. The sales reps bring in tons of product to stores that do not sell so they can make big commision. On average I would work 16 hour days at 6 days per week if you want any sleep or life outside of work this position is not for you. You have to be at your first store at 4am and do not get paid to drive there just pray your first store is close to your house otherwise you might have to leave a 2am to get there if you're lucky.
good,Selling in incremental displays to increase points of interruption. Make sure all ad activity and products of value will be executed in  first position. I learned that building relationships and selling value is the proper way to sell. Management will support you and inform you of any sales information in a timely fashion. Staying in touch with merchandisers on the weekend. Getting the customer and my company the results they want sales wise and gross profit.
good,Agradável
good,"absolutely no room for advancement (your stuck). Long hours, very repetitive , no help, treated like a mule"
good,"buen ambiente de trabajo,la gerencia fuie bastante comprensivos"
good,Corporate mission is clear although the standard daily functions were skewed to accomodate the needs of the organization at the smaller office settings. Overall a great company to work for especially if you want to be cross functional.

good,work as technicians for the repair of refrigerators of the company
good,"I worked as a merchandiser for 3 years. Good company but if your a hard worker you, you will be given more work than those who are lazy b/c you can handle it. I had the highest volume stores that our branch covered and almost always worked 6 days with those stores b/c I did a better job than anyone else did in those stores. Basically I busted my rear to get my day done while some slow/lazy merchandiser got a cake route b/c ""hey, he couldn't mess that up."" 10% of the people do 90% of the work! Pay was higher than same job with 7up or Pepsi at the time. Management was great, merchandising supervisor was great. Once and a while got last minute free tix to a college football game or something like that, which was a nice perk."
good,"They ask alot of their employees ,pay them well,communication could be a little better but overall a good place to work and advance"
good,"working in the warehouse, working outside counting drinks that route salemen brings back."
good,Been there for 4 months as an agency worker and I am treated pretty well. My only criticism is that they cannot discuss between the higher management and come to conclusions
good,Good company to work for. Very stressful at times. Can take a long while to get into the swing of the job dependent on how your training weeks go. Decent pay.
good,Being an Account Manager requires lots of driving and traveling to different locations and cities. Be prepared for long driving time and hours and little sleep. Usually up at 4:00am each morning and home by 8pm.
good,"Journee typique, beaucoup de controle a faire et  ajustement sur divert point de production. Beaucoup de connaissance chimique , limite et technicité  des appareils. Un savoir a aborder et transmettre les infos et les directives. Responsabilité sur la qualité de la production."
good,"I loved working for Coca-cola, One of my best jobs in USA. Fun environment however the pay is low in comparison with other call centers. A lot of opportunities for advancement. Overtime is optional but available most of the time."
good,"Grew here into every role possible and made me learn a lot for a fortune 500 company. Did sales/marketing/event management for years and enjoyed the day to day. "
good,Company downsizing due to transition of bottlers.Fun place with good incentives.Call center work can be a grind but at the end of the day good paycheck if you know how to sell.
good,I had 9 stores on my route on which I had to go to 6 everyday. I learned a lot about coke and its history while working there. management was nice and was there if you needed anything. workplace was enjoyable you were like your own boss and not bothered with as long as your job is done
good,"As an account manager, we focused ordering of products for stores while keeping professional relationships with the key account contact. Stores and territories ranged depending on geography but my territory housed large retail giants like Wal-Mart. Can be stressful depending on the retail industry you're working with as inventory can be difficult to manage around Holidays, Summer, etc. Corporate atmosphere is definite as they have a brand and reputation to protect."
good,It is a good place to work and you do get a lot of benefits from it such as staff drinks orders each month or unlimited Coca-Cola when at work.
good,"Coca-Cola was a great company!  Lot's of opportunity and career growth, phenomenal leadership.  Great industry to start your career or remain long term."
good,"Die CCE AG ist ein zukunftsorientiertes Unternehmen, in dem Prozesse für wirtschaftlichkeit Arbeitsplätze reduziert."
good,"CCE is a good place to work, with a friendly feel. In almost 6 years my position changed dramatically and became almost 2 jobs in one."
good,Arriving  at work usually the production line was running..so we were responsible for ensuring  machines ran without and upset conditions  and made repairs as needed. When the production run was completed we were responsible  for preforming  a predetermined  and scheduled list of preventive maintenance on machines. I was able  to learn the working of various machines involved in the production of sodas. Also learned about  water treatment used to purify water used in the process. Additionally got some experience with ammonia cooling system used to cool product to needed temperature. I had the privilege of working with many great co-workers during my time at Coca-Cola. The hardest part of the job  for me was the commute to work. The most enjoyable part was the relationships formed with co-workers  and all striving together to reach a common goal.
good,Une entreprise qui permet véritablement de se développer et d'apprendre son métier de commercial.
good,"Ik zou aanraden aan iedereen, een goed loon en het werken met machines, het hoeft alleen maar te willen"
good,"Diverse environment, Mangers will spend time with you when needed to develop and/or coach you"
good,"Es un buen trabajo, se hacen buenos compañeros ahi ,se aprenden muy buenos valores y muchos cursos de los mismos"
good,"With the right attitude and drive, advancement in the company is achievable. Personally, I have learned a great deal from my time with Coca-Cola, both as a manager and labourer."
good,"Not one of the best places I have worked, but not a bad place either. If you can become a driver there you get taken car of very well. The warehouse workers do not have it that good. Stuck mostly working 2nd and 3rd shift and due to the fact they only hired one worker at a time we were short handed and the new employees were overwhelmed and usually didn't last a few weeks if that long."
good,Always a Coke SMILE!!!!  Everyone loves Coke! Enjoy helping customers meet their business objectives.
good,salida a trabajar temprano y trabajo bastante pesado y laborioso pero como todo trabajo de ventas con tres asaltos en ese tiempo son solo gajes del oficio y la administración hasta cinco horas para poder liquidar y salir a casa
good,This company does not have salaries to compete with surrounding companies. Management is terrible. Does allow for advancement and position change.
good,My days were always busy. I learned how the number one sales and distribution company in the world goes to business. Management was not very creative; this corporate culture is steeped in old southern tradition; more like bureaucrats instead of sales and marketing managers. My co-workers were the best of the best and most have moved on to more flexible sales environments. The difficulties in this job evolved around service being centralized and taken out if the hands of local distributors making local customer service a nightmare for our clients and those of us in the field. The most enjoyable part of the job is that we were selling a product that almost everyone wants to buy and the sales force was knowledgeable and well trained.
good,I enjoyed the people.
good,"Coca Cola has been in business since 1886, they have made it through all of the hard times in the past. They have good benefits, but there is no upward movement from the position I am in, so I am looking elesewhere because I grow bored with the work I am doing. I am Payroll back-up, and I enjoy that a lot. The hardest part of the job is when I am answering the front lobby door, and the phone is ringing while I am working on a project which requires a lot of concentration. I have to go back and start again when the work is disrupted to that degree."
good,- Pas de possibilité d'évolution ni d'opportunité de développement
good,A typical day at work is...start work between 4 and 6 in the morning...work 14/hrs a day...then repeat....
good,"I worked here for almost 2 years in the East Hartford CT location. I liked it for maybe the first year then it became too much for me. For those who want overtime, this is the job for you. You can basically give 5 minutes notice that you want to work a 16 hour shift and theyll say OKAY SURE STAY AS LONG AS YOU WANT! At the same time, when you have places to be, and things to do.. it gets annoying. The SCHEDULED shift is 8 hours, but if youre new, or on 2nd shift... its rare to work an 8 hour shift. Starting pay is pretty good, mine was like 14.25, then 16.50 after a year, didnt make it to two years which would have maxed me out at like 18 and change. Its a union job which has its pros and cons. Management seemed to only care about productivity. They talk about safety safety safety, yet.. if you arent meeting your quota, u might hear about it. They dont seem to understand that lifting 40 pound boxes 1500-2000 times a night is quite strenuous... so meeting their standards isnt always a first priority. BUT.. a job is a job and i guess it wasnt too bad .. paychecks were juicy. Benefits were good. I was 18 at the time, kinda miss it looking back"
good,A typical day includes long hours and production related stress.
good,get along with co-workers
good,"Una jornada laboral de mas de doce horas, aprendi muchas cosas de mercadeo en general y tuve una jefe de mercadeo excelente, hay mucha capacitacion de parte de la empresa, la parte mas dificil es que el salario asignado no nos compensaba . No hay asignacion de un monto para desplazamiento, entonces uno se agota caminando mucho para llegar de un lugar a otro, fuera de que se sobrecarga a los mercaderistas con muchos almacenes,, me gusto el aprender de otra forma distinta a mi enfermeria, otro campo."
good,"es una buena empresa una gran capacidad laboral para mejorar todo punto de vista,,en nuestro trabajo con gran enseñansa"
good,"Typical day at work is beginning when most are going to sleep, and working all day in a fast paced ever changing enviroment."

good,good place to work at with great benefits. a place where you can advance and become a strong hold with friendship.
good,"My typical day at work can vary it can sometimes be pretty busy or very laid back and calm. I learned so much from working at coca-cola. I learned all about the systems i use daily as well as how to manage and work with other people effectively. I get along with all my co workers very well. I genuinely get along with everyone at here. The hardest part of my job is trying to explain a complex payroll issue to our hourly employees however, i have been very effective with my approach and explaining it with there terminalogy rather then my payroll jargon. The most enjoyable part of my day is when i complete a task and I get congradulated on it."
good,"If you need hours, this is the place. I don't blame the company for being so demanding, and no one really can. They are the leader in soft-drink distribution and rightfully so, considering the amount of hard work given by their employees."
good,Good benefits as employees such as discounts on product. Ability to work on own always a plus
good,"They are great , I loved the pay and the hours were just all over the place and I was in school and I really wished I could of kept that job and big from it because I could be driving the trucks right now"
good,"Enjoyable crew, lots of overtime. Team work oriented. Helped me to get forklift certified. Advancement at this company is achievable with hard work and regular attendance."
good,"You  might join for the brand, but stay for the people"
good,Corporate-minded individuals with strong customer service skills are what is needed for this company.  It is a well established company with many rooms for advancement.  Being well-staffed in the Sales and Marketing department is vital to their growth.  I feel as if this company does not have suitable staffing for maintaining current Coke  accounts or attaining new.
good,Fast Paced Work Environment that continually changes based on business needs. Bonuses are based on Market Unit goals as opposed to individual route performance.
good,"Coke is a job that if you start out young, advancement can be done. You have to decide if you want to go the warehouse direction or the driving way. An employee can decide after a few years to decide what direction they want to pursue. Coke is a fun job to do. They really expect a lot out of you."
good,"I loved my time at Coca-Cola.  The work was exciting, the people were friendly and encouraging.  Most benefits were great, however the pay was on the low side."
good,very family oriented before cce bought us out  very good pay and good hours  didn't have to work weekends or holidays got paid weekly a lot of good guys
good,"Was very proud to working for Coca Cola, never had any problems with management. Worked for Coca Cola for 24 1/2 years holding several different positions."
good,"A Refrige é uma empresa em constante desenvolvimento, sempre atenta ao mercado, consumidores e opinião pública."
good,The management at the time was not very supportive but it has been several years since I worked there.  The typical work week was about 45 hours.
good,"Everyday is a challenge, good place to work, with supportive management and the best thing is we got lots of company perks."
good,"Managing delivery drivers, work assignments, morning checkout, communication to sale department. IE volume posting, account coverage, Payroll, Dot compliance, customer service, collaborate with merchandising, projects ie charters on cost savings and spending. working with internal and external customers, supporting co, workers. Managing the return rate from returns and refusals of deliveries. Most enjoyable part of my job is Customer service and building volume."
good,"•	Built and maintained product displays in compliance with company standards."
good,"My typical day consisted of filing and organizing customer information.  This included everything from sales receipts to updating pricing, addresses, and special requests.  My management was very trusting and allowed me to implement many different systems that allowed workflow to run more efficiently.  My coworkers, who were mostly either fellow AR department members or collectors, were a crop of very driven and competent people.  A real delight to work with.  The hardest part of my job was probably handling, what could be at times, a very intense work load.  Depending on the time of year, extra hours would be required and that could be straining at times.  None the less we always managed to pull it together and complete our tasks in a timely and efficient manner.  Finally, the most enjoyable part of my job there was earning that sense of accomplishment when I was able to complete a lofty task and also being able to watch as systems I implemented made not only my job but others easier.  That was very rewarding."
good,"simple job, but a lot of heavy lifting and management over loads your schedule "
good,It's a pretty nice job. There is no one watching over your back which is a plus. You have the potential to receive raises every year. The hours can tend to be a little crazy at times and you can be called to take on different routes pretty far away on short notice.
good,"Typical Day is long"
good,Ever changing / evolving work tactics and go to market model
good,"A typical day Coca-Cola Enterprises Cold Drinks Centre involved ensuring that all staff conducted their jobs in a safe environment.  The job entailed conduct audits, risk assessments, training workshops, safety inspections, being involved in the safety committee, being involved in OHSAS 18001 (Safety), ISO 9001 (Quality) and 14001 (Environment)."
good,Good place to work. Loved the coworkers and the costumers I worked with. Hours can be long including a lot of holidays and weekends but they make it worth while.
good,Clock in stretch get a piece of equipment and start picking product to build pallets for the trucks 
good,Coca-Cola Enterprise is a nice company to work for i believe that it lacks a little in the management department. The money is good but i feel you don't get they pay you really deserve based on the hard work you put in. The people in the workplace are friendly sometimes you might run into a store manager with an attitude but u just half to deal with it do what they ask and work your way around it because if u don't they will call your supervisor and u may get in trouble. what i enjoyed most about the job is representing my company in the most positive way i loved to clean up our backrooms where we kept our product to show competition how a hard worker really works. my co-workers and I all worked as a team if somebody needs help at a store and there running a little behind  more than likely someone will cover ya next store for u or someone will come and help u.
good,A typical day at work consist of a morning team conference call to recieve updates on the previous day. That is followed by a morning of order taking in my larger accounts. The 2nd half of the day I spend hunting new business and looking for new opprotunities.
good,• Created and implemented an inventory tracking process
good,"Good company, plenty of room for advancement. Depending on what department you're in you could work some very long hours."

good,Very fast-paced working environment.
good,I arrived to work at 4:30 am and made sure all trucks were loaded and ready for the drivers. My drivers arrived between 5:00-6:00 and we checked the loads and made sure they had all the equipment needed for the day. When all drivers were gone I reviewed the previous days paperwork and DOT logs as well as open dispatch for the next day. I would then work close with dispatch to insure the routes were as tight as we could make them. I would go to DMV almost weekly for license plates and also to all the repair shops who serviced my fleet. I held bi-weekly safety meetings with my drivers and monthly safety meetings with the rest of management in Greeley. I enjoyed training new drivers and providing all the tools necessary to make my team a sucess.
good,"Fast pace work, always changing. I have learned differant computer programs, effective management methods."
good,"I enjoyed working for the company learned alot about the beverage business, co-workers were like family. Enjoyed helping the customers meet their goals on time. The hardest part of the job was leaving due to them relocating out of state. The managers I worked with were easy to approach and had an open door policy."
good,"taking orders from customers, it is a good job, schedule adherence and managemnet is very helpful. they have an excellent breakroom and pool and game room, they have phone rooms and also a library with computers if you wanted to go and get on internet. they also have an on site mini-gym with showers."
good,"My day at CocaCola is filled with phone calls from internal customers. I've always had a back ground in Customer Service but this position gave me more insight to customer service when dealing with another employee. Helped me see the value of great customer serviice that begins ""in-house"". Coca-Cola gives opportunity to it's employees by promoting from within. My co-workers have been with the company for years! At Coca-Cola I've grown comfortable with the role that I play so I've overcome most of the obstacles that were presented to me."
good,"Great experience, great place to work. Multi cultural and diverse environment. Excellent benefits."
good,"This was the company I was going to retire from, but today's economy even hits Coca-Cola and I was laid off. Throwing cases in the warehousing/distribution facility or being a Merchandiser are the ways to get your foot in the door here. Once you prove yourself there were plenty of opportunities for advancement.... literally around the country and the world! And free-flowing Coke in the break room sure don't hurt! The corporate structure can be annoying at times, but you'd find that in any big company."
good,"No training program in place which is a shame. There are room for improvements, overall I like working here."
good,Coca Cola was a great opportunity that was unfortunately cut short due to the realignment. I wished that it didn’t have to end. While there I was supported and it was a great environment and culture.
good,"Mi puesto de trabajo es entretenido, porque tienes muchas funciones que realizar: estar pendiente  del  cartón que necesita la maquina para intercalarlo entre las capas del producto, los palets,las bobinas de  plástico, los rollos de etiquetas.

good,This company is a beverage company. Good company benefits. Management was like any typical management. They have high quality expectations. They have different work shifts.
good,Coca-Cola Enterprises has a great corporate structure in which there are many executive managers whom allow an open door policy. The opportunities for growth are unlimited as I had the ability to start in one department and have the opportunity to explore another department in less than a year of service.
good,"Coca-Cola taught some values that I will not forget. Although I wanted to stay at Coke because of endless opportunities I decided to leave. Leaving gave me the opportunity to have more to time to focus on college. However, a bigger reason was that we had one the lowest employee happiness ratings out of all of the Coca-Cola facilities in the U.S. This was due to poor management but nothing was changed even a year after that survey. A few months after I left, the three managers were let go and many of the employees that I still talk to say it is much better now. Great place to work, I still think about going back to work for them."
good,Bonne entreprise avec évolution possible si potentiel
good,Beaucoup de possibilités d'évolution. Une grosse culture d'entreprise. Manageurs toujours a l'écoute et disponibles.
good,"Learned to work independently and on a team. Worked extremely well with others, Followed company procedures. Gained invaluable skills. Often had to troubleshoot and seek solutions within time constraints."
good,by the very nature of the product you will work your behind off. Wal Mart receives between 8 and 15 pallets of product every delivery. About 80% of what is received is needed on the floor immediately. So get ready you are there by yourself and it all needs to get filled before you leave. sometimes the store will be on the list twice in one day. The second trip through will be just as empty as it was in the morning.
good,"This was my first challenge working in Europe. I found the company to a dynamic place to work, with many challenges. The work ethic was tremendous and I enjoyed my time with them."
good,Much of my sales experience was gained with Coca-Cola.  I had the opportunity to learn several different facets of the business and try new things while constantly gaining new sales experience.
good,"This job gave me my first hands on experience in managing a unionized work force.  I was used to taking the initiative to just jump in and help when and where I saw fit, and with a unionized work force that can be frowned upon."
good,"I work in a fast paced environment, responsible for many administrative functions which include, but are not limited to payroll for all union employees as well as implementing all of Coca Cola's policies and regulations."
good,the hardest part was working with store managers and deal with the demands. they had to make sure management was happy so I understood why this happened
good,Entreprise en perpétuelle évolution avec à chaque fois des nouveaux challenges à relever. Super intéressant et enrichissant tant au niveau technique et développement personnel mais surtout humainement avec c'est hommes et c'est femmes qui avancent tous ensemble.
good,"The most enjoyable memory I have of Coca-Cola Enterprises were the people from the senior leadership down, they were focused on communication, integration, inclusion, and diversity."
good,low paying company.  benefits are good and extra vacations time can be bought.  product lines are constantly added which increase work load. lots of heavy lifting and often came home exhausted.
good,start about 6 a. m. and get done in about 10 hours Monday through Friday. Deliver about 20 stops a day. Unload pop and deliver into stores. Heavy lifting and repetitive lifting and bending. Management was kind of overbearing but big company garbage to deal with. The customers were pretty good. Got to see some different scenery everyday. Backbreaking work. Getting paid and customers were good.
