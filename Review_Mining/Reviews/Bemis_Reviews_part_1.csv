rating,review
bad,"The company has a very efficient setup that has a potential to make profits, Amcor is a large company that enjoys lots of diversity in the employment pool"
bad,"Everyone is extremely overworked and the pay is not consistent. You will get in big trouble if you talk about your own salary. For the exact same position, some people are salary exempt and some nonexempt. They increased the workload for those who don't get overtime pay and decreased it for those who do. If you voice your concerns, expect to have repercussions. When we brought up our concerns bout the excessive workload, we were told that if you don't like it find another job."
bad,"Terrible stay away "
bad,Company cares about nothing but profits.  Workers are consider slaves who should be grateful to be beaten.  Layoffs when slow and can never keep a full staff due to unreliable employer and no one wants to risk working at the plant.
bad,All management are related.no one has a college degree maybe one has an a.s. If you get on wrong side of supervisor even though no direct contact you are done.HR takes their side never wants to hear you.
bad,"Cultura agressiva e intimidadora, sem oportunidades igualitarias"
bad,They only took care of the people that was in there click. There human resources department sucked . they really don't care about there employee's they treat you like trash
bad,"world class benefits my but, insurance goes up every year. yearly raises dont cover the cost of living, nor pay for increase in insurance. basically losing money every year. operations manager is a 30 year old punk, that's never gotten his hands dirty in his life, but tells you how to do your job. no leadership in maintenance."
bad,"I can't express enough how much of a hostile work environment this is. I would not recommend this company to anyone. Total lack of vision, experience, and management."
bad,Don’t really remember much about working here other then it’s a factory line job where you constantly move boxes from the machine to a pallet your on a team with ppl that barely help you and show a lot of favoritism
bad,Worse place I've ever worked. They mandate overtime every week and refuse vacation when they have projects to complete. Management never thanks the loyal employees and pushes then past the limits frequently
bad,"Job sucks, management really sucks, lots of lies, don’t believe anything this company say, they just string you around like your a puppet, turnover right is very high, old equipment that’s never fixed, if your not kissing their butt they don’t like you,"
bad,Bemis cares nothing about their employees or their home life. In fact we never had a home life. They only care about making themselves look good! There is so much overtime! One of the worst places I've ever been employed!
bad,They do not I repeat do not value their workers and can't stick to their word from the head HR to the Leads. I wouldn't recommend them to my enemy.  DON'T DO IT
bad,Muita bagunça não tem organização tem muito cacique mandando para poucos índios tem 10 cacique para mandar em 5 índios baderna total aquela empresa
bad,Poor management which creates a poor work environment for employees. Long hours mandatory. Work conditions are not great for employees' health. The pay is not worth working there.
bad,"HR will stab you in the back every time she could . Each employee"
bad,"This is by far the worst place you can work at. They hire (illegal) workers from a temp agency which pays $12 an hour but pay us regular employees $17+ for the same type of job performed. Human resource personnel does not have coworkers interests in mind. 12 hours shifts, zero chance of advancement. 2nd in charge of this facility is not fit for the job. He will fire you for looking at him wrong. This place is a joke. The head of Amcor is a good guy, surrounded by unethical management below him. HR does not care about us."
bad,"They preach safety and yet they want workers to work in harm's way and in unsafe working conditions.  Management is a joke, all kids that don't know what they are doing. No matter what your position is  you will be a material handler 99% of the time."
bad,Horrible management. Supervisor takes sides and does not get the other side from the person who is the temp to hire. Was told supervisor would come in and talk to me then decided to have temp call and say they did not need me anymore but gave no reason! Would never recommend this place to anyone! Supervisor has favorites and they do no wrong complete bs!
bad,"their wasn't really much that was likable about it but how much they paid. they don't really train their they put you out on the floor and have someone tell u what to do and then see if you do it right or not. A slight few of their floor managers to i think should't even be managers. On my second day i was put on one of the hardest lines their and the was asked "" has it broke you yet"" and then laughed at me."
bad,"I worked in maintenance on blowmold and there was not a single person, there that is a tradesman. Most of them were operators turned maintenance, most by just sucking up to management. A lead electrician that doesn’t know an electric dryer is 220v. The other lead that “qualified” me on the lathe and milling machine pointed to the surface grinder when I asked about a grinder to sharpen carbide lathe cutting tools, it wasn’t equipped with the appropriate wheel for that, he flat out didn’t know. The same ignorant mouth breather also brought me a woodworking belt sander to restore the profile on a machine cam. There are a handful of really smart, good techs there but they’re walked on and treated like idiots because they’re not about sucking up and actually do their jobs. The only detail this company did not lie to me about was the address, literally!! I was told about pay progression to get to top scale, they changed their wording on that ofter I quit a good job for that one. They promised 2weeks of vacation which I got but was impossible to get any “approved”. I was also told I would train in the facility for 90 days on all the equipment with the PM crew and then put with a shift tech for the rest of the training but in reality they stuck me mopping and cleaning up after the PM crew. After 90 days they put me on shift, not to train, but to replace another tech and learn as you go, but still with entry level pay progression. There, maintenance is responsible for quality, setting up the machine, change overs, and operator on top of maintenance responsibilities. They are also terribly"
bad,"Supervisor acts like she's your mom,and not management, she is in everybody business instead of doing her job , there is no growth at all in the place"
bad,it was a horrible place to work and would never work there again the manager was unbareable and you would get written up for any reason the lunch breaks were only 30 mins long and had mandetory overtime almost everyday
bad,"To see a real life example of a bad dream, come work at Amcor Chino. Plant supervisor has no clue on what goes on in the plant. Unethical and abusive behavior towards employees were reported to human resource but ignored. Wage gap between same-level employees are unreal. Amcor is a non-union organization which means you are not protected against any type of mistreatment by upper management. The Amcor way does not believe in fair wages and fair working conditions. A typical work day for Amcor machine operators include operating 2 or more machines for 12 hours which you are responsible for. Any quality defects found are always the operators fault, even if it isn't. Production supervisor will find a way to push blame on machine operators, which always resulted in a written documentation. You also have the production supervisor hovering over Amcor coworkers while they work. It wouldn't be an issue if he is a people person, but he does not know how to talk to employees, which makes things awkward. Health care benefits are atrocious. Premiums are sky-high (basic coverage through Blue Cross with high deductible). Just a lousy company overall for a machine operator to work at. Morale of the company is low. Mechanics are cool though. They kept things fun & productive at the same time."
bad,"the Management team is worst I've ever seen.  Not strategy except to ""aspire"" and make more money next year than this year.  No plan how to achieve.  Leadership team dysfunctional and don't work well for benefit of company or shareholders.  They always make excuses and waste effort on covering their mistakes."
bad,"Everyone was very unhappy, no job security, nit picking managers, finger pointing, dangerous environment, dangerous chemicals, no support staff after hours, will be written up for the littlest things, no communication, not worried about customer specifications, constantly losing business, lab staff is not respected and work very long hours and its hard to request time off"
bad,Don't really like it it's not hands on to far from home lunch breaks aren't long enough it's just an all around not very good place to work the pay is good but don't really like the company
bad,The worst place ever to work. Lots of favoritism my management. Supervisor do nothing to help you and will throw you under the bus. Terrible training. No quality standards. The plant in Centerville is also on the list to possibly get shut down. The people also voted for a union over a year ago and still have no contract and the people are very divided.
bad,This company is falling fast because of a poor culture and a lack of accountability from the senior leadership team.  People are treated unethically and unfairly.
bad,"The Bemis Company overall seems like is a great place to work. But, the Centerville plant is a different story. The Plant Manager and one supervisor is always harassing and treating union supporters different. They target them for unfair disciplinary action and is trying to reduce the union supporters to get them out of the plant. People just want to be treated with dignity and respect. If you are not a supporter of fair employee treatment, this is the place for you. If you want to be treated fairly, don't even consider this a last option."
bad,"Engineers hit the three year vesting and typically leave.  Travel is listed as 25% and in most cases is closer to 75%.  Long days and you won't get comp time.  1980's management style with a heavy blanket of micromanagement.  "
bad,Do not work here unless you are absolutely desperate for a job. I would rather cut small pieces from my genitalia and sell it on the black market than work for this company again.
bad,"Empresa muito boa de trabalhar, aprendi muitas coisas; tanto na parte profissional como também na pessoal."
bad,management always ignored the people who were actually doing the work and paid complete attention to the whiners/complainers
bad,The management team plays favorites towards certain employees  and does not work with employees for work life balance. Don't even think of complaining to HR about anythjng. Management is clueless. Managers allow the team leads to run the entire shift instead of managers being managers. Violent place to work. Employees threatened each other and these employees are still employed. Harassment happens and nothing is done about that either.
bad,Long hours with no results. No pay increases in 4years. Management doesn't care about your feedback out you. Cares about their PIP Bonus more than Safety.
bad,"no engineering, no electrical department, safety is to political and non existent, read the other reviews and you can see the corporate culture of ignorance and sycophantic, all the managers are wana bees with no skills and or training in human relations, the workers are keeping the plant together, while management tears it down."
bad,loved my job and co-workers learned how to run slitting machines
bad,"The worst job I have ever had, the management treat you worse than the number zero your just not a number you are taking up their floor space which is not yours,"
bad,Used to be family oriented. Management is terrible and they don't care about employees. Constantly feeling threatened they will eliminate the factory from production.
bad,"Management doesn't care about the employees.  Supervisor positions are given to people ""on the buddy "" system.  Not to the employee that has earned it."
bad,Used to be a great place to work before the new Plant Manager took over. Took away Paid time off from all plant workers cause they could. Now they are taking away money by not paying for overtime on our short week.. I definitely need a new Job...
bad,Management is horrible stretched to the Limit can't get people to stay and they got a HR person that is horrible HR person supposed to help you keep you out of trouble not get you in trouble
bad,"Current Operation manager sucks  as well as the maintenance managers, they are bullies and play favorites , the pay is good but mis managed right now ,no room to advance unless you suck up to managers"
bad,Stressful job and got worse when they kept changing my manager every few months what does that spell for a family person and they don't care about you only what they can get out of you then when you get burnt out they hold you accountable for being irritable and unproductive like you can think clear after 12 hour days for 30 days in a row with no days off in between.Not a good place to work and have the highest employee turnover that i have seen in my career.
bad,"Terrible place to work. Might as well live in plant as much as they work you. Won’t compensate workers for doing their job plus someone else’s job and wonder why no workers are happy. Can’t have opinion or ask questions or you get labeled a troublemaker. Managers will sabotage interviews for you so you can leave undermanned areas, or any production area as they are all understaffed. Pauls Valley plant is a train wreck"
bad,"The complete lack of proper management and proper hiring practices hinder this plant in Pauls Valley. They will work you to death, short-handed for 12 hour shifts 6 or 7 days a week just to insure the management team gets a good bonus while us peons get the shaft. You will do at least 2 peoples jobs with no extra compensation, train new hires and be expected to still get production even if it means hurting yourself. They will not promote from within unless it’s one of their “boys” they like. All good jobs are posted outside building and not to workers from the floor. Basically since There is no union they will run over employees until they quit from exhaustion or just quit coming back. But corporate doesn’t care. Last 7 years lost 20 to 30 employees that had 10-30 years experience. Anyone who can leaves"
bad,"Expect to get thrown under the bus. Plant leadership is extremely cliquey and if you aren't part of the ""circle of trust"", don't expect any support. You will not be given any meaningful goals and there is absolutely no focus on personnel development. If someone that is well-liked creates an issue, they look for someone else to blame/take the fall. Constantly changing conditions lead to frequent layoffs. Not a place for long-term security."
bad,"I loved the job but the management was very unprofessional and not at all customers driven."
bad,"Very hot, everybody is rude and is very hostile. Pay is good but that's the only thing good about it. The pay is not worth the attitudes you have to put up with from the operators and the leads. Management is extremely cut throat, always Short handed and the machines are constantly breaking down."
bad,"It would be a great place to work, but supervisor and mngmt are both like Hitler was to the Jewish people, other employees will stab you in the back and the union if they have one, you will pay but if one person doesn't like you they will not fight for you, no brotherhood at all, company tells Union what goes and who stays I had 6years there, and company refused to listen to my story and firedme"
bad,"Worked at Bemis/amcor got 20 plus years  do a great job and they won’t promote you  management is a joke !"
bad,"Management, made the job harder than it needed to be. Amcor needs management, that values dependable hardworking employees. The manager would go off on you for no reason, even when doing a good job."
bad,A lot of drama and backstabbing especially by management. They are more concerned with making themselves look good by making employees look bad believe it or not. Toxic  enjoyment.
bad,Management is iffy and constantly changing. Culture is people down on their luck. Many laws broken and no leadership at all. Can not express yourself or you will get fired.
bad,horrible place to work. they now hire felons and no longer do drug tests. no room for advancement. poor management. overall not a good place to work. most people out there have only worked there a couple years.
bad,Only work here if every other factory is full.  It is a complete joke.  The HR Manager does not care one bit about policy and will talk about you to other employees.
bad,"Management only pushes to run faster faster faster, they talk day and night about safety but really they could couldn't care less about the employees. Constant changes based on stupid ideas and no interest at all in what we the employees making their money say about anything"
bad,"Cut throat, no support,  lack of consistent training, management are back stabbers, team leaders are lazy as f**k, the gossip between grown a*s men is absolutely ridiculous!  This company really need to step back and look at the whole picture and wonder why they cant keep help so they use the temp service to get people!  Shame shame shame! No life working here"
bad,"Production is more important than an employee's well being. You don't get sick days. They penalize you for taking care of your health. "
bad,The workforce is lazy.  The management has no clue what they are doing and the hr women are back stabbing liars.  The supervisors don't do anything except sit in an office and mess around.  The old workers do nothing but talk and the young workers mess around.
bad,Company is poorly managed from the top all the way down.  Plant personnel are treated unfairly and core values are not practiced.  Uncertainty rules and loyalty is not ever considered.
bad,"Terrible management extremely top heavy despite having an overabundance of management production is still a chaotic mess, clueless as to what is taking place. Strong culture of favorites if not in the circle there will be little opportunity for advancement and will likely get stuck with the most undesirable tasks. Horrible training to put it mildly, no production support at all. They will leave a brand new person to struggle blindly trying to do something no one has done before for  12 hours and get a laugh out of it. Contrived pay cuts, causing the hourly pay to fluctuate wildly. Taking earned vacation time away from senior employees. Could be an absolutely wonderful place to work if they cleaned house in the managerial department."
bad,Minimal to no training was offered. Training manuals were lost. Broken promises. On call 24/7 which was not part of the job description. There was no work/life balance.
bad,"This company's culture revolves around playing favoritism. Ive worked at corporate and at the headquarters office and I've seen the same kind of issues. The HR recruiting team hires under qualified people who theyre friends with rather than qualified people who receive ""pity"" interviews to make the recruiters numbers look great. First off, hiring managers should know what they want, so why do the recruiters get a say in who gets the interview? An engineering manager could love a candidate and know theyre perfect for the job except the recruiter may refuse to give the candidate the opportunity for personal reasons. Another example I've seen are people who get shifted into positions without having the experience and even people who are refused to get another job because they don't have a bachelors degree. A broken HR system is a critical issue for a company and a company cannot succeed having people run their company in unethical ways. I was better of at another company that valued people who could grow in their jobs. Many other employees/managers felt the same way which is why they left the company. Changes need to be made, or employees will continue to be unhappy and quit."
bad,"In reality they are more focused on firing people than hiring people to run this understaffed facility. Forced overtime is terrible. They look for any excuse to write you up. No matter what happens, whether it's a machine messing up or not, it's always your fault if something goes wrong. They care more about their product than their own employees. Make us run double lines and do the work of two men for the same pay. Terrible place to work and most employees I know of aren't happy here."
bad,"Upper management tells you just what you want to hear and then does the complete opposite. They don't match your 401k, the health insurance is outrageous, supervisors look for any reason to write you up. I'm currently a employee and the atmosphere is cover your own but, document everything. Bemis tells prospective  qualified applicant's just what they wanna hear to get them in the door, then these people find out they've been lied to. Bemis doesn't care about their employee's health or families. The pay is good and they give out gains share bonus maximum 3% but, what they don't tell you is management gets upwards of 10%. They can afford to do a little more for the people who do the physical labor but they choose not to. If you don't like overtime don't come to Bemis. Like I said the pay is good but that's the only thing."
bad,"I used to be proud to work for Bemis, but a few years ago, management changed, and it was not a good place to work.   While the top management has a great vision, and is doing many positive things, they do not have competent senior management to execute, especially in Corporate Finance.  They do not get the big picture, and they do not understand anything out of reporting, but think they do, and are more than happy to say sure to something that can't be done.  Plus who wants to spend that many hours working in an environment where teamwork was not encouraged, and joking or laughing with your coworkers was discouraged?  Many valuable employees have left the company."
bad,"management was not willing to help train new employees, it is left up to employee to learn all processes and procedures. And if you don't fit in, they will let you go."
bad,"fast days learned team work, safety integrity and social responsibility"
bad,"I worked for this company in Vancouver, Wa. for just 7 days, the union that represents the workers were taking 5 cents pay for every hour you worked, on top of your monthy dues. When I asked the Local union president why and where the money went, she said she didn't know but would get back to me, two days later I was fired. The foreman said I just wasn't a good fit, I never did hear back from the union president. You draw your own conclusions."
bad,"Poor work environment, (Bemis) plant I was In the nepotism was wide spread. Only  way to get ahead was to be related or hang out with management. If you were not in the select group you were looked down on and always in the wrong. "
bad,"On a daily basis you don't have direction. There is a lot of confusion, too many chiefs not enough Indians. And management does not want to take ownership on the problems that happen on a daily basis."
bad,"Worst experience I have ever had.  Manager micromanaged every move everyone made in the plant.  Went through 3 managers in less than a year.  Nobody listens to each other, and very much a ""them"" vs ""us"" mentality between salaried and hourly employees."
bad,"Bemis only cares about 1 thing...MONEY!! It will always be profits before people and safety! Lack of leadership by upper management which is why supervisors and dept heads dont stay very long. Management also has their favorite employees who seem to do no wrong, and dont have to play by the rules, while other employees are made to feel like their just there to fill a void. Im so glad im no longer associated with Bemis!!"
bad,Well to start they just gave us 30 day notice to cutting our pay and taking away of four days vacation. Management runs the company in a manner based upon intimidation.
bad,"Bemis is in the process of being bought out by Amcor. In an attempt to make the company look better on the bottom line they are firing many long term employees. Anyone with 20+ years experience and 5 weeks vacation are being let go on a regular basis."
bad,"First of all Bemis Healthcare Packaging in Oshkosh should really look closely at their Leads and Supervisors , I have never worked someplace where the Supervisors and Leads talk about their current  employees  and former employees ,actually its more like they make fun of them. If they don't like you they tell everyone else.  I worked with a newer person that was slow on packaging (according to the leads)and they were telling everyone that they were going to fire her, but they didn't talk to her about her performance.  I guess if you have a problem with someone then go to that person not everyone else. Also since your working in a ""clean"" environment you cannot chew gum or candy but the leads and Supervisors do? Also you have to wear latex gloves at all times but yet the leads don't while they are on the belt?  You go through 1 week of schooling and 1 week on the floor then after that your supposed to be with the same trainer for a while but many in my group was not, we were just basically thrown in there and the people that have been there a while expect you to know things you were never trained on, there is a huge lack of communication between the Leads and Supervisors with the general workers and operators on this issue.  If your sick you have to beg to go home, hmmm weird in a ""clean"" environment why would you want someone sick there?  I call that place a ""revolving door"". Soooo many people come and go and these are just a few of the reason why!I would never recommend it to anyone. Just way too many people there that think they are the boss when they are just a general worker"
bad,"If you are willing to work 12 hours on your feet and switch from days to nights every two weeks, then you will be pleased with the pay. The most discouraging thing working at Bemis is the management. There is definitely favoritism and do not expect advancement unless all of management likes you."
bad,Poor upper (corporate) management decisions become the burden of the plants. Don't leave a stable job for this company. Company seems poised for a take over.
bad,"Una empresa que en la region de México CA & C esta mueriendo lentamente por malos manejos gerenciales desde hace al menos 3 administraciones y si esto ha sucedido es por malos manejos desde el corporativo en USA."
bad,"There is no job security, they play the blame game and if you are new others blame you for their mistakes.  You spend so much time CYA that it takes 2x longer to do anything.  Your manager will also throw you under the bus to look good."
bad,"Bemis as a company at the corporate level is very concerned about their employees and their well being. At the local level  ( Lancaster plant ) the management is very poor. They are not understanding of a employees family needs, fairness in their way of promoting employees, and the time and effort put in by the employees   As a whole the fellow employees are good to work with but there is some issues of family member or friends getting special favors for job promotions and such."
bad,The experience I gained at my former employer was extensive.  It was a fast paced and ever changing environment that fostered my intellectual and business skill growth.
bad,A good job if you don't to advance and stress about lay offs 24/7.
bad,"Terrible terrible terrible working here is like being in prison you cant keave yhe grounds your whole shift, forced to work overtime everyday. No vacation for a year. No sick days only points. At 8 points your firef."
bad,"Constant pressure/stress; did not like working here at all; when we hit our targets it was never good enough, always wanted us to do better; never heard what we did right, always what we weren't doing right"
bad,The hard workers are always punished and the lazy ones get a pat on the back.. The only person who gave me respect was my supervisor.. I guess upper management and HR like to have people leaning on the desk and standing around talking while the elder people done their work for them.. You are pointed to every little thing you do there . The refrigerator / cooler they have for toy to keep your lunch in has all kinds of stuff growing in it.. While upper management has a very nice aide by side refrigerator to keep their lunch in.. Just like our 2 year safety celebration they ordered us lasagna catered in while they sit in the front office and had Panera bread for their safety lunch.. Very disrespectful place to work.. I would never recommend this place to anyone. And the quality girls on A shift are the biggest trouble makers there.. When you go to HR about them nothing that a ever done.. They are exactly the reason I left along with many more..
bad,"Amcor has absolutely no care or concern for low-level employees.  You're overworked, expected to do umpteen things simultaneously, watch 5 lines by yourself, and even do some of the work that management should be doing.  Even when you tell management about the difficulties of your job, or tell them that you need help, you'll often get responses from them such as..."
bad,"After working almost 90 hr weeks for over 6 months in a row, my job let me go due to a point system. Has total disregard for employee mental and physical well-being. As well as the fact they are trying to appeal my unemployment because my car battery died. They are honestly a horrible company to work for. Good luck to all new applicants. You’ll either get fired within two months or quit."
bad,"To each their own but they lose more employees than they can hire hence, lots of forced overtime. As they saying goes: I work to live and not live to work. Some folks like 72 hour work weeks.."
bad,The management and supervisors don't and will never care about you. Only the lazy and people who don't care about the job or the parts they make stay because they have it easy and don't have to follow any of the plaint rules
bad,Sorry to give this company such bad press but when I was there nothing was good  about it. Hopefully they have cleaned it up !!
bad,"98% of business is making plastic bottles, and the company that they make the bottles for is seeking to start making their own bottles. Potential for the elimination of alot of jobs. Great co-workers at the facility."
bad,"24 hrs a day production facility of plastic packaging who operates on a rotational ""southern""swing shift which really messes with your body, health, family life , and attitude"
bad,"Does not matter which Bemis you work for. All people here are just tools to be disposed of. Management is terrible, he said she said judgment types. "
bad,"You work one week Mon, Tue, Fri, Sat"
bad,"could use better management not stable place to work your working fast all the time, and you do a lot of walking you do quality cheeks and a lot off moving around and inputting data into computer."
bad,My opinion of Bemis is reflected in the ratings already provided. I don't feel the need to explain beyond that. I'm not a disgruntled employee it was simply the way the company was run.
bad,"Generally a good place  to work, assuming you can keep the job. Most seem to be temp workers, which they fire for any reason, I wouldn't be surprised that they fire good working temps as well as the incompetent ones. Training, if you get any, is contradictory. Some don't even bother to tell new temps where the disposable gloves are. Gloves that are not marked by employee owner with their names a or initials tend to become ""missing"".  "" Performance"" dismissal excuse not specifically explained, Work depends on what line and who you work with. At times I was working harder than my line co-workers who seem to be intentionally doing the minimum but wanted me to do more, even though they could see I was getting exhausted."
bad,I work there as a temp for a year the management team keep me there saying they were going to hire me full time then canceled my assignment .The place has poor management there were several days I was released early form work because they ran out of material.
bad,Poor management throughout all departments. They play favorites by letting some people get away with what someone else would get fired for. HR is useless.
bad,"When I worked here in august 2018 at the centerville iowa plant, it sucked. If you got sick easy, dont even try to work as a BMO,  you will just get worse and worse. I had to go to the doctor a lot because of no humidity. You could not smoke on property, or to be able to leave property during breaks to across the road to smoke, I dont smoke personally but that would suck for any would suck!"
bad,"Horrible managerment. Uneducated lack of experience management, no leadrship skills. Do yourself a favor and stay away.. Preached safety but didn't act on improving."
bad,"No work-life balance with this company,  ridiculous amounts of hours. They'll tell you it's just for a couple more weeks repeatedly,  but it never ends. Expect to work most holidays. Company is being bought out by Amcor. You would be a wise to avoid then until that transition is complete. If you're lucky, most of the managers will be replaced by new or Amcor people."
bad,"Amcor is currently a terrible place to work.  No honesty, and they are only thinking in the short term.  It is a miserable environment that I would not wish on my worst enemy.  VERY high turnover."
bad,"Maintenance department is not run well, the total moral is bad because of management.  Management and team leaders don’t have the knowledge to lead anyone.  They don’t pay you for your knowledge or skills.  "
bad,"I have been at the company for 4 years. The pay is relatively unmatched for the positions they offer. However, they require you to put the company before your personal life. You are required to work on your days off. If you want to make sure you have the day off, you need to use PTO. Otherwise, they can and usually will ""ask"" you to come in. The times I declined to work OT on my days off I was brought into a meeting with HR and told if I decline, the optional OT would become mandatory. I am also ""encouraged"" to stay past my shift on days that I work. The company purposefully runs each department understaffed or at most bare minimum. Many people work 12hr shifts, 6 days a week. Some even work 7 days a week or more. I put ask or encourage in quotes because if you decline a request you will be brought into HR  to explain that even though it is a request there can be consequences for not cooperating and they can still make the request mandatory. If you don't have a family, don't like your family, and don't have a social life, this is a great place to work; high wages and near unlimited overtime. However, if you want any time to yourself outside of work, this is not the place for you."
bad,"Amcor would be a great job, and it probably is on other shifts rather than the one I worked on. It is fast paced, pays well, and provides great benefits. Most coworkers were great to work with. However, the women who have management titles, but far from managers, are extremely sexist and play favorites. The spineless HR rep seems like a nice guy, but is ready to walk someone out at any moment. Amcor provides the paranoia that any misstep will shove you out the door."
bad,To hot of a job I didn't like it at all and it was through a temp service and I didnt like the management they were rude. So I just left one day and went to find another job
bad,"Very cliquish, if you're not friends with the shift leader you're screwed. The air conditioning at most of the machine lines do not work. We actually had people pass out from this. I would say only work here as a last resort."
bad,"It's a small family owned company, great work environment, clean, quiet place to work. Nice team of ppl.  Nice learning environment. Pretty uplifting place."
bad,It was a good place to work years ago and will be again. Once a new management team gets in. It has its slow days and hard to keep up days. They use alot of temps and that dosent help with the day to day job. They do hire the temps that stick around long enough .
bad,Duties included setting up orders and running machines that makes bags for the food industry.
bad,"getting too go to work,new changgers"
bad,Established opperators will make assistants run the machines and take the fall for them. some even play cards in the break room as you bust your but alone to do their job at a lesser pay. favoritism is rampit.
bad,"Was at one time a great place to work when alcan owned and had  control! Bemis bought them out and from there all pride and love of being part of a great company with a great future was slowly stripped away with no hope of return! A lot of great hard working, skilled people chose to leave or retire early!"
bad,"Unable to answer this at this time. However, work was not as it had been expressed upon hiring. This is not a full description of issues."
bad,This place has their pros and cons. I have worked there for a year and a half. The management is a joke. its so hot there in the summer time. they have fans but not a lot you have to wear a hair net and a hat on top of that. the drama in that place is unreal. NO ONE gets treated fairly.
bad,Pay rate is good but is eaten up by 450.00 per month insurance and management is atrocious. The stress level is too high and the push for production is unreal I understand that corporations need to make money but Bemis is just greedy. The best part of the day is clocking out and the worst is  clocking in.
bad,Worked there for over a year trained and mastered everything in the plant just about was never late only missed if I was dying was guaranteed a full time position after 90 days and never got it but they are hiring 60+ year old people that they know can't do the job over their younger stronger  more experienced clientele they make a lot of promises and never follow through poorly ran facility.
bad,Went out of business fired a bunch of people without paying them there dues if they were still open i wouldnt suggest my enemy to work for them they are extremely unprofessional
bad,"Not good working environment in production areas."
bad,"Job advancement is next to impossible."
bad,"Management is horrible, they constantly lie to you and change the company ""guide lines"" to benefit them. Constantly worked under staffed while expecting the same output. They talk big about safety but only do anything after someone gets hurt. The moral is horrible on the production floor. Pay and benefits are being cut, get ready to work holidays, weekends nights for long hours. Supervisors are unfair and only treat their friends with respect so you should be ready to suck up to them."
bad,Bemis is a very hard driven company by its foreign owners who expect something for nothing.  You are forced to join in team activities and made to feel uncomfortable if you dont.
bad,"Poor management , lack personality, too many chiefs not enough Indians plus employees were treated poorly on shift. Poorer supervisors at least on 1st and 3rd shift !"
bad,"I was a 17 year employee, jumped through all their hoops, worked their stupid swing shift, almost never called off, worked hard and got paid good money. And for doing all that, I never felt like I had any job security. I saw guys that got fired for almost nothing, when other guys that were lazy and had quality problems but were good brownnosers were worked up into management, given straight day shift  jobs. I finally saw enough and left.shiftjobs."
bad,Company keeps taking and taking and wanting more  and more in return. Shift work is not ideal and now there are talks of going to straight days or straight nights
bad,"Hours are terrible and in healthy, they show no remorse for the employees that work the horrible hours and have a hard time sleeping, working 12 hour shifts with 3 hours of sleep in two days not good"
bad,In a nutshell the culture at Bemis is to pass the buck on to the next person. My general manager knows very little about machining or engineering but is a decision maker in this particular part of the business. I'm not sure how the management team got to their positions but it is a good ole boy culture where needless positions are created for people that are part of the club. Now our facility is under scrutiny by upper management in an effort to control cost due to the restructuring efforts at Bemis. One of the most obvious and correct decisions to make would be to clean up the unnecessary overhead but unfortunately they are resistant to that.  I could go on for hours about the ongoing issues at our facility but I think I covered one of the bigger ones.
bad,You never know if you going to have a job or get written up for the previous workday.   Very streetlights environment to work in. And the crew leaders are no help at all
bad,"BEMIS is a cutting edge company that is changing it's policies at a rapid rate. On the factory floors in the Healthcare Facilities, there is absolutely no sitting for 12 hour shifts.If you are a package handler, you are required to fan through product at a rapid pace, while measuring and packing it. Typically the company prefers to have only one person on each line to do all of this, as the machine rapidly puts out more product.They are now changing this to the operators and assistant operators doing this function, plus operating their machine. While the packers are running the quality testing on all machines, reworking product that has an issue with it, or boxing the product in a separate room. There is constant competition for favoratism or just to keep your job."
bad,"I worked through a temp agency for amcor. I worked 60+ hrs week. Friday the supervisor told us to stay and help get caught up. I had no problem with that being I work 60+ hours anyway, never late or never missed a day. The first shift came on duty at 7:00am and the 1st shift supervisor told me to give him the lift so he could help and to go ahead and go. I said to him are you sure? I don't want to get in trouble and he said yes I will tell the other supervisor.  I gave him the lift and clocked out.  Later that morning I got a call from temp agency that Amcor doesn't need my help anymore because I left work! I would NEVER have left if I thought I would be dismissed.  It's no wonder why the indeed feed is full of job vacancies at this plant! Check out your supervisors if you want to keep good employees."
bad,"Extreme amount of overtime, not a family oriented company, management misuses authority, Safety is number 1 until it affects production and quality, no annual raises, unprofessional management. unsafe congested work areas in the warehouse."
bad,"The ONLY thing keeping people there is the pay. Mandatory overtime every week, and management is the worst I have ever seen. Huge turnover even with the good pay. Would be a good company if they would replace every member of management."
bad,"Management and company more concerned about getting new machinery and the Luke than their employees. Many instances of high/cracked machine operators in New Albany, OH plant which puts everyone at risk. More frequent random drug testing needs to be done (all employees should be routinely subjected to this at work, on work time so they can’t go home and recoup erase before showing for a drug test). Some frequent/long term users know how to work the system or appear completely normal while working due to their tolerance. No doubt that drug sales are happening on Amcor property too. I’ve seen drastic and sudden behavior changes in a friend that works there and probably due to possible reintroduction to drug culture and use at work and the 12 hour shifts that keep employees from having any type of real home life or relationships outside of work. Should go to 4 days a week for 10-12 hour shifts. Like 2 days on and 2-3 off but set days or they change every other week."
bad,When I was there the other managers use you and take credit for yout hard work and accomplishments. Upper management was lied too and decievied by the ones that they thought were doing such good jobs. If they dont like you they will set you up for failure.
bad,"When you work for a union, it's kinda hard. They are always seem to be battling each other. And now that they are merging with another company they want to lay off"
bad,"The employess are great and willing to work with one another. they are willing to adapt to new things and work with management to come up with better solutions. That being said, the management here is poor, They create a toxic enviroment to work for. They are fast to write you up for things outside of your control as a basic employee, and when they ask for explanation, even for things outside of your control they reprimand you anyway and insist you take accountability, even though they themselves dont know what it is they are insisting you take accountability for. management themselves take 0 accoutnability for any of their mistakes in a sense where they are reprimanded."
bad,"The pay and benefits are good... the rest is bad. Management in this facility is easily the worst I've ever seen, the HR department in particular. In fairness there are a couple good ones but they're out numbered by far. The administration will straight out lie to employees be it one on one or to the group as a whole. There is a very ""me"" mentality which leads to finger pointing and blame instead of looking for solutions. I would not recommend working in this facility unless all other avenues are exhausted."
bad,"Huge shifts in management and subsequent strategies have created a stressful and difficult culture to work. Cost cutting and restructuring seems obvious that it is positioning itself for sale. Some really smart and dedicated people, many seemed trapped in a perilous culture."
bad,"I worked as a forklift operator in the warehouse on a temporary basis through a nationally recognized staffing agency. I was placed on a job alongside a full time company employee doing the exact same duties as the other employee for far less pay. That in itself should tell you something. At my facility,there were no real shift foremans but only ""warehouse leads"". These were hourly employees with foreman duties but no managerial authority. Lacking authority, I found that many ""leads"" had difficulty with giving orders to the many belligerent and quite frankly LAZY people there so they'd find the one person that would actually work and lay a ton of duties on them. If you don't like overtime or value your weekends then don't work there. You work towards your 3 day weekend all week only to be told you have to work anyway. The ""bottle line"" is terribly understaffed and should be a two person job. Loading trucks is good but prepare as the bottom hand to do all the difficult loads that the others don't want to do. Favoritism? You'd better believe there is. Double standards too! I noticed immediately when I hired in how unhappy everyone was there in the warehouse. Were they ungrateful and just belly aching like most people do on every job in America? Probably. But speaking for myself, I saw many, many areas that needed improvement. Perhaps morale would go up if those improvements happened. But I didn't stick around long enough to find out. That's the bad. Now for the good........."
bad,Working on your own machine is common and the management is terrible. Their leadership skills are sub par at best. The only reason to stay is the pay and benefits. The turn around rate is terrible.
bad,Chaotic Work Environment! Company is poorly organized in whole and doesn't have or updated standards for their practices.  Let's Just Wing It Approach!  Which makes them failing to exceed their competitors and stay ahead of them.  Very Poor Management!  Bemis is actually falling way behind most other Company's in this area!
bad,"Non-competitive salary for those that have been there for a while."
bad,"es un trabajo donde te dan la oportunidad de aprender a manos llenas, he aprendido de la empresa asi mimo de mis compañeros en campo laboral te brindan el apoyo, los jefes no tienen buena mente abierta, la parte mas dificil del trabajo fue en aprender el modo de trabajo que se indicaba, el aviente que te brindan ,los compañeros en modo laboral"
bad,"The management team is self serving. Keep the machines running at all times! They get bigger bonuses that way. People don't throw out products that fall on the floor, even though it is against GMPs, because they have to keep their production numbers in an acceptable range... or else they get a bad review. The pay is decent, being that it is a union job, but that is all. The union has no pull for their members. If they want to get rid of you, they will find a way even if someone lies to do it.  They got rid of managers that had been there 20 years+ for people that didn't know anything about the place, equipment, or how to manage. Nepotism runs rampant here. If there is family higher up in the company, you get promoted. If you work hard every day for years, you get overlooked. They don't care about your accomplishments. They only care about the numbers. People were promised advancement... a chance to move into higher positions with better pay, that never came. Me included."
bad,"The company was owned by Australian company and there was big disconnect between their strategy and U. S. management.  From the top down, there was a lot of misdirection and lack of leadership."
bad,"The Amcor site I at worked at was a nice place to work but the current managemant is destroying morale, there are a lot of good people working there and it could be a great place to work if it had the right people running it."
bad,"If you like working and not having a life, Amcor is the job for you. Management is prone to overlooking employee concerns and life complications. Bottom line, Amcor is a corp. that cares only about shareholder returns and net income, not you or your family."
bad,I work during Mondays to Fridays. Not everyone there is approachable. The management was is not organized give then job or to instruct the work you have to do.
bad,"Good Compensation, but very poor management. A union company, but the union provides little protection for its newer employees. very difficult for a work life and family balance. you'll find that you're always at work especially as a new employee and forced to work a swing shift."
bad,"It is climate controlled in the Finishing and Quality areas. Finishing works 12 hour shifts you are supposed to get every other weekend off. But it got busy enough they were forcing overtime so you might only get one or two days off a week. Now they are requiring you to run two machines, but if that isn't enough they will force overtime again."
bad,"Very unorganized ,and was expected to do other peoples jobs.Changed management offend with little to no support during the transition.With no salary increase in two years."
bad,"Management and others in office are kindly put not nice people, hours and flexibility for family life were wonderful, job was fast paced I liked that. Not acknowledged for doing well is a major problem in company positions."
bad,I didn't mind working at Amcor I learned a great deal there as a Machine operator. I found the management was replaced to often during my time there. I f they could had one good stable manager there during my time I would still be with Amcor.
bad,boa empresa. Salario poderia melhorar. tive problema com a localidade. A empresa e boa
bad,"Poor work environment that was many times hostile. Experienced racism and bigotry by many of my co-workers to include supervision. Many times dealing with hazardous or unsafe work place . Constant intentional deception of job benefits , pay and job promotions by supervision. While there I had a child born with Downs Syndrome. That earned me the nickname ""Mongo"". Bad language and physical threats were a constant there."
bad,I did not enjoy working for this company. I felt like I was just a number and not an individual. I felt like the work I did was never appreciated.
bad,"answer calls, fix machines that have issue ,do pm on machines that are not running, work on  shop rebuilds when there are no calls and all pm are done"
bad,"Company was very small half driving half wear house. Good Benefits, old equipment, over all it was a good company to work for."
bad,Previous plastic company sold to a competitor. Competitor came in and laid off 60-70% of staff.Went from 15-20 people per crew with four crews down to 6-8 on just 3 crews.
bad,"Shipping and reciveing, measurements, packaging. Working long ours. Good benefits, poor management good pay. inspections, running machines, testing bags,"
bad,"The company as a whole seems to be struggling, and the moral of the plant is awful. Certain people are treated differently from others and they panic non stop rather than figuring out long term solutions"
bad,Fast paced work. Keep busy. Variety of task to perform ever day. Not able to get breaks every day. Safety is first priority for employees. Rotating shifts are not great for a family life with children.
bad,"This company is very flexible towards staff, however, there is not enough personal interaction. "
bad,Amcor has restructured their business a few times however the most recent leadership is not qualified or capable to make sound strategic business decisions.
bad,this company pays good and have great benefits the machines down a lot 12 hour shift rotate weekends off . its a lot of unfairness and favoritism here. its not easy to move up people not retiring or quitting.
bad,This place used to be a good place to work at. I worked there 7 years and the pay was good but the hours sucked especially if you have a family. If human resources don't like you then you won't get ahead there. The place has gone down hill and they treat you like you are in prison and you can't go outside at all for the 12 hours you are there unless you work in the office.
bad,"Bemis used to be a great place to work. Not anymore. They don't care if you have sick kids or emergengies come up. No sick days or personal time. You can't miss 5 days in a year. Management plays favorites and watch out if you have a target on your back! They will fire you even if you have been working there for years.  Now all the employees are just numbers, not people. You are not respected even though they have trouble finding people stupid enough to work there. I suggest finding somewhere else to work. The only good thing about working at Bemis is the paychecks..."
bad,"Decent job, management should be replaced. Hard workers, working under management that shows favortism and lacks knowledge of running a company. Job security is now gone, summer time layoffs, old work force retiring. No work coming in due to losing contracts."
bad,"Sem critérios para promoção, pouca transparência para os critérios."
bad,"The entire job isn't bad, the hours are good if you need full time but overall not a good place unless you really need the money. Supervisors will talk down to you if you're younger than them, treat you like a robot."
bad,There is a high overturn in employment at Bemis.  There is no room for professional growth or promotion.  Bemis cares more about profit and less about employees.  The employee base isn't diverse.
bad,Very bad maintenance leadership poorly qualified upper management very bias mentality. I worked a maintenance mechanic.
bad,So first you wall in and it looks chaotic but it's not just seems that way. So clock in and if you landed yourself a nice position in electrical maintenance like me you would have to walk up the stairs to top office sign into the company CPU and an Outlook email and address they made for u to get your ind. Task list for the night
bad,we lost 4 major contracts whole departments are under threat to be shut down no new business coming in. stopped hiring a couple months ago allowing people to point out. maintenance manager is super hostile
bad,It seems to be declining every year.  You are forced to work overtime all the time .  Management has a hard time communicating with employees.  Company doesn’t pay employee as well.
bad,Aprendi muita coisa em questão de segurança e higiene
bad,"when I worked at Bemis it was under some of the most horribly conditions possible at that time. Personal were horrible in setting when we were to work, our hours, time off etc. would not want to go back"
bad,Very long days of work with a-lot of overtime and barely any days off. but there was a lot to be learned.
bad,"La empresa por políticas no te da una seguridad ni estabilidad laboral viniendo de agencia. A pesar de que el trabajo en si es redituable, muchas personas están a cargo de muchas cosas, lo cual puede volver confusa una orden, hay en cierta forma un caos laboral en ciertos puntos."
bad,"Have preshift meeting, go out onto the floor and get to work either running a palletizer or the floor."
bad,"Start at 6am to 6pm fair working conditions would go to work do a pre-start and plant pre-start. Go and do what we where instructed to do. Witch most days for me was doing final trim butter works, working with pipes and gas well heads on some sites. I learnt how to operate a Grader while i was out there witch was fun and exciting would like to do more on them. Great crew to work with everyone got on very well and shared there experiences and skills to help one and other out. The hardest part was living in camp with no phone servise at all so we couldn't call home for 2 to 3 weeks. Was a pretty ordinary camp to had no facilites or activites to do after work and to top it off it was a dry camp so couldn't even have a beer. The best part was being able to work with a great bunch of blokes on site that new what they where doing wicth made everyones job a lot easier. Was just a let down with management and pay."
bad,"They bought the Ball Plastics Facility in Cinnaminson, NJ, and closed it a year later, scrapping almost everything, after spending millions on upgrades. They run a very tight ship and have absolutely no tolerance for foolishness. The pay was good, $15+ to start for most positions, topping off at $18, with good benefits. You'll work most holidays if your scheduled, but you get holiday pay on top."
bad,"Pay is really good at first, but tops off quick as they dont wanna give you a fair pay raise. They just see how much around you gets paid for the job and keeps the rate a little above them."
bad,"Es una empresa que está en el camino por tener los estándares internacionales de multinacional. Actualmente, tiene algunas oportunidades en la construcción de planes estratégicos como compañía, definición de roles y responsabilidades y puede construir una cultura laboral agradable."
bad,Bemis offers good opportunities but doesnt follow through. If you do not have senority than you getting treated unfairly. If you are not in the union than you are in jeopardy all the time of losing your job. The machines are really old and some are unsafe. If injury happens than they dont believe you even of they have medical proof.
bad,"Worked there for 7and a half years. Started out as a packer and worked my way up to a Operator. Theybare stricked on attendance so if you like to miss work than its not the place for you. Lots of overtime with 12 hour shifts. Hotter than heck in the summertime and the lead  are rude and snotty. Supervisor barely leave there computers so no worrys there. Not allowed out side  at all. You get lots of discounts like Ford, Gm and a whole bunch more. Free shoes, glasses and shirts once a year."
bad,"not professional management , they have a standard erp supply chain systems. co workers are knowledgeable and helping . manager needs to be more assertive and have planned strategy"
bad,"Micro managed, reported to non-financial manager was difficult, distance was great, benefits were great"
good,"Working there is easy and simple. The problem are the full-time employees. They criticize, gossip, and yell at you. They act like they can get away with it and some so. If you don’t mind getting harassed at work everyone you go in. This job is for you."
good,"Stand on your feet for 12hours "
good,It gets very hot in there so always try to stay cool. The pay isnt that good for the labor. They have. High expectations. They take forever to give you a raise or benefit's. You need a good memory to keep up with everything you have to do and you need to be quick on your feet and a very quick learner.
good,"Working for Amcor was an interesting experience. I was only ever a summer helper at the company but found that it was not always the most enjoyable. At the end of the day, it was a job that paid well at the time for what I needed."
good,The 12 hour shift was good 3-4 days off a week. Work was very stressful. Had a lot of annual training. The hardest job I ever had.
good,"Hard working environment, fast paced and intense working conditions. PPE is required and provided. Swing shift is the best shift to work on and the funnest."
good,"Amcor has four shifts. A,B,C,and D . A and B crews work 12 hour shifts during the day on a 2-3-2 schedule. Though upper management is on site, the work environment is relaxed due to constant mechanical work. C and D Crews work night shifts. You will have no life working these night shifts. The company was growing very fast, but they were not taking their employees with them"
good,"The money was great I made a lot the time frame I was there. You work 7-7, theres mandatory OT nearly every week for 1 day sometimes you have to take a second day. you're supposed to work 4 days on 4 days off but it rarely works out that way. They get really mad if you drop a pallet (usually machines fault though) and if you dont answer your alarms fast."
good,I leave from amcor because my wife she will coming from another country I can’t work overnight this is my first reason the second reason no respectable from to many coworkers
good,"Long stressful days. No time for a total plant PM program. Management was driven very hard, due to production demands to meet customer requirements, which is not any different than any where else, but do more with less there is a limit."
good,"Running for 12 hours straight, no work-life balance, swing shift.  Minimal training and follow thru. Wages do not keep up with cost of living and management hypercritical."
good,Não promove o crescimento e o desenvolvimento pessoal e profissional. Raramente paga o PPR. Não concilia trabalho com vida social.
good,Worked in Procurement department. Not very good environment to be in. Not very clear vision for opportunities for staff. Tendency to let people go too quickly.
good,"Bemis as a job is ok the problem comes down to there upper management ""off site"". the ""foot on the ground"" management are pretty good guys that care about the employees. but to the upper management you are a number to be used up and tossed out."
good,"There are many good people here, but the upper management and region management have no concern for the average worker, and treat them as such.  Region management very difficult to deal with and changes positions on important matters often."
good,"I love my work so working on the machines and the gratification of trouble-shooting issues were the highlights of my day.  Management structure, work space, boundaries, and communication through out the plant need some serious adjustments and management needs to be trained accordingly.  You will be paid for your chaos and receive a nice benefit package.  It is definitely somewhere to get your feet wet and learn the schematics.  Not somewhere to get comfortable or complacent."
good,"Company values a degree over experience. 15+ years experience and paid less than new grads."
good,"Company is Closing and there will be no offer to move. Loved working for this company, best part about it was my customers and meeting deadlines...."
good,pretty good pay but the managament wants to mircomanage everything.
good,"Amcor es una empresa donde tiene un buen clima laboral, donde tienes las facilidades para poder seguir emprendiendo nuevos retos."
good,"Bemis will be selling off the PE Packaging Division. Great, loyal, hard working co-workers."
good,"Poor management, says if you don’t like it there’s the door. Don’t care what employees have to say! Just do your job and shut up philosophy. Your just a number!"
good,High turnover results in constant roles changes and expectations..poor work life balance and goals that are always changing. Pay and benefits have always been above standard.
good,Lack of infrastructure and IT support severely impedes work progress.  Management unsupportive of salary personnel.  Improvement projects are no longer being pursued/supported.  Opinions rule and fact based management is no longer part of the culture.
good,Good place to work friendly staff .maintenance staff fast response to calls. Management staff excellent. Good place to learn on your own but you really have to put in the effort too.
good,"Enorme esfuerzo sin reconocimiento real"
good,"Empresa con grupo de trabajo joven con mucha injerencia en la toma de decisiones. "
good,Bemis is not a bad place to work if you do not have children or if you have a spouse to help with the balance of work and family.  Long hours as you worked 12.5 hrs per day with an abundance of overtime.
good,again i liked this place at first but its to hot and the leads can be super rude to you we got short breaks we should get more since it is hot. I liked my cowokers always fun and hard working people
good,"Management has little time to train production, issues are ignored by supervision. Little time for family. Responsibilities are piled high."
good,My experience with this company was great. The employees there were very  willing to train me in all areas of the plant. definetly a place i would recommend to those looking for an outstanding work eviornment
good,"Working for Amcor is just ok. advancement oppertunities are limited,teamwork is very strong. overall on a scale of 1 to 10 I would give Amcor a 6. Employees of Amcor not very happy."
good,"This position was a year in training for the position at Curwood in Paul's Valley, OK.  However, I did quite enjoy this position as it was all about learning new things, which I greatly enjoy.  In the end I found that the year in training concept was a great one but was ready to get back to the southern half of the US."
good,It is an alright company to work for.   Good pay and fairly good benefits.  The plant that I was employed at seemed more chaotic than other plants.  Over all you are just a number to management but the regular people you work with on a day to day basis are good and supportive.
good,Hard to balance work and life with mandatory overtime and requiring to work 12 hour shifts. No notice ahead of time as far as holiday scheduling and days off for those.
good,"The work itself isnt horrible, but the amount of rules and pressure they apply to you is frustrating. Work/life balance sucks. And management is incredibly inconsistent about decision making and treating people fairly. Only redeeming qualities this place has are the ability to give you alot of days off and good pay for the area"
good,"This was a unique workplace. Deep seated union culture, with all the positives and negatives which go with that. "
good,A empresa e uma multinacional que promete muito mas não da opurtunidade para seus colaboradores.
good,Amcor was a fast paced environment. There is strong emphasis on safety. You must have good attendance and good work eithics to secure your job in the workplace.
good,This company has the mentality of managers are always right. Their way or the highway. This creates turnover. Production works 12 hour days/nights. Lots of overtime.
good,"A typical day at work starts with a review of the night/weekend before, we go over new/old action items. This is followed up with a balance of machine fire-fighting and improvement team actions. Most days the machines dictate when you are done for the day. "
good,"Boa empresa, contudo, com oportunidades limitadas de crescimento."
good,Pretty good job over all. Hours are just not working for me. Only working two days average a week. Slow season . The job itself I loved but you just never know when you will actually work. I worked in any area in the warehouse and learned it well. I was a temp and was crammed with so much In so little time. I didn't mind that but I felt misused by my last trainer. I would run and work the entire shift with no problem.
good,"ive been there a couple years and enjoy my job. the work/home life isn't bad at all, three 12 hour days one week, four 12 hour days the next. they've hired a lot of new management that most everyone on the floor isn't too fond of. The breaks are the best I've ever seen anywhere, some days you might get five or six breaks ranging from 15 mins, to an hour depending on whats going on. some days though you might get one 15 or 20 minute break all day, it's just the nature of the job."
good,"Treated like a robot, and expected to act like one as well. Been a good place to work and enjoy all the co workers just treated badly."
good,"Challenging both strategically for long term and day to day. Ever changing, particularly with new facilities purchased."
good,"When I started I believed we had job security. That was a lie, management believes we can do more work with less people and constantly talk about lay offs. Any issue that is brought up by employees will not be fixed. The people you work with on the floor are for the most part awesome people. But higher ups could care less about you. The pay is great (could be more competitive), the benefits are not as good because of rising health insurance costs, the hours are enough when you work but awesome when yo dont, all the overtime you could want to work. Overall a good job if you're in a pinch to find a job but this job is going downhill fast"
good,Its a poorly climate controlled building that has had a lot of upgrades done to it. so instead of being really hot itll be cold sometimes. Management was nice but too laid back and let people screw around more then they made them work. while other managers just sit in the office all day and only show face when something huge happens.
good,Fast paced and can be stressful.  Job duties can change in a moments notice.  Overtime is scheduled to cover vacations.  Wages are better than average for area company is located in.
good,You burn out quickly; I lasted a little longer but the company talks safety but doesn't really believe in it. The machines are old and held together by patchwork methods
good,Team I worked on was great. Not the best benefits (PTO mainly). Some opportunity for career advancement. I started as a contractor and was told I would be getting hired on after my contract. Find out a couple weeks before my contract to find out there was not a position at the moment and I would get a contract extension without a raise. When I did more than most of the employees I worked with.
good,Not a Big Fan of Bemis. Profit is everything to them even though they tell you it isn't. I made a mistake by going there. Felt like the crosshairs were on me all the time.
good,"Good place to learn, due to a big variety of equipment, but management comunication is really poor. Always pushing, but not enough spare parts. No training program, just relaying on another coworker."
good,A typical day usually isn't too stressful.  Management does not act on any concerns brought up by current employees or contract employees that were told they would be hired on as full time employees.
good,Takes 20 + years to get on days as an operator. They start at decent pay rate but tops out at a lower than other comparable factories in the area. No matching for 401k. And the insurance is expensive for what little it covers.
good,At the time I worked there they had management personal who could not be trusted. These people are no longer employed with the company. But with that wages are competitive and job is not awful. Just 12 hours shifts can be hard to have a life.
good,"Management made some very bad decisions which cost hundreds their jobs - I want to work with a stable company closer to home, dayshift with weekends off"
good,"Alot of changes and the feeling that management does not care or their hands are so tied that they become hard and emotionless.  Very little praise or acknowledgment for going above and beyond. Very, very little room for advancement."
good,"Plan to work more than 50 hours per week in a very fast paced, demanding finance arena.  You will be well compensated for this work, but the work life balance is missing."
good,"Most shifts are 12 hours and are am/pm on a 2/2/3 work week, you would have to get used to it if you have never done it before."
good,Good working environment.  Everyone is on 12 hour shifts  There is a lot of overtime.  Decent Benefits  Customer base is very strong and diversified.  Products are everywhere in the market
good,"Amcor Rigid Plastics is a manufacturing leader supplying plastic containers to the Beverage, Food, Home and Personal Care markets.  In my role I managed 15 select accounts across the US in the Spirit and Wine segment.  Along with managing current accounts I would explore new business opportunities.  I enjoyed this part of my job.  Amcor has aggressive sales strategies for it's sales people so it's imperative that sales managers know their accounts and their markets. It's a fairly lean company so sales people are required to get involved in day-to-day issues which takes away from active selling time.  The hardest part about working for Amcor was the emphasis and time spent on internal reporting, this also took away time from active selling which is what I enjoyed most about my job."
good,"If you want money, its a good place to work but, if you want to see your children grow up...it is not  Excessive work schedule and macro-management."
good,Amcor is a great place to work as far as compensation and benefits. There is zero work/life balance if you are in management. You are expected and required to be on call 24/7.
good,"I worked there for a little over 6 months, started out great until a new supervisor was promoted to our shift, this supervisor unjustly treated everyone on our shift, He yelled and spoke to each employee inappropriately, curse them because he was having a hard time controlling productivity and waste. Which our shift never had a problem with the first four months without him. He told me that he was trying to write up and get ride of the ppl he deemed unworthy to work there. Overall management could be improved to prevent this kind of behavior."
good,Great job security but not much else. Compenstation and Benefits are lower than the market and not a lot of advancement oppurtunities.
good,"-Prepare Daily, Monthly, Quarterly, and Yearly Sales and Margin information to Sales and Marketing."
good,"- Empresa boa de se trabalhar, porem algumas parte administrativas deixam a desejar."
good,Good place to work
good,"We would work 12 hour days, with some great people. And would all ways get the job done,"
good,"ok place to work  rotating shifts hard to get used to "
good,Management only cares about cost savings not about quality won't listen to operators to produce a better product. Claim saftey is priority but when waist numbers rise due to saftey disciplineary actions are forthcoming to the operator for not working faster
good,"Si bien la imagen corporativa se hacía presente, fallaba la implementación de la misma."
good,"Amcor produces quality products at the lowest possible cost. The major focus of the company is cost reduction, which is necessary in the highly commoditized packaging market. This business model makes justification for innovation, employee development, and increased pay difficult. Management is focused on driving profit."
good,"Bemis was an okay place to work, but due to its large size and many ""cooks in the kitchen"", it was difficult to get things done.  The culture was fine, except for the general lack of responsiveness from people working there when it came to internal matters.  This made it a struggle to get work accomplished since you had to rely on people in other functional areas for information and they seemed to place email communications in the lowest priority level, so unless you could catch them on the phone or track them down at their desk, just getting the info needed to make decisions or the right people together in a meeting was a daily struggle."
good,"J'ai effectué un stage d'un an en tant que contrôleur de gestion, bonne expérience dans sa globalité"
good,"lo mejor la cultura laboral, el compañerismo es lo mejor"
good,work not bad most managers ok not much chance of moving up to amcor you are just a number not a person they dont mind spending money they just dont want you to have it
good,"Bemis was a great company with opportunities to grow (northern part of the country). Biggest disconnect was between corp and field, newer leadership was trying to rebrand HR within the support from field leaders."
good,Competitive pay and excellent benefits. Good 401k as well as life insurance. Work as much overtime as you want. Shift work is 12 hour days or nights. Rotation of work days thru a 4 on.
good,12 hour night was not for me. there was a lack of training program. i also noticed there was a need for knowledgeable workers but no willing trainers.
good,Was an enjoyable place to work but the swing shift from nights to days were difficult. you could move up in the company but the shifts were not enjoyable.
good,They aren't really understanding to family problems and things that we as people can't control. They have a wide range of jobs on hand . Very quick response time for their clients.
good,Had supervisor that didnt really know how to interact with team. Was a dictator and only saw things the way he wanted. Talked down to team and was reported multiple times with no results.
good,"Nível alto de companheirismo entre as equipes, todos com o mesmo objetivo e comprometimento de entrega para a empresa. "
good,the job is very redonent .but pay very well for what we do . lots of labor and longs hours. I would say it a good place to work if you like long hours. and the rotation is sometimes great with four and four off
good,"The company is generally well run, but is very quick to point fingers and want to fire people. There is a great divide between people that work in the corporate office and those who work in the manufacturing facilities."
good,"Empresa que era pontual com os funcionários ,fornecia todos os benefícios aos funcionários, só a estrutura e maquinários antigos que não ajudavam muito ."
good,"Es una rea con mucho reglamento por seguir por motivos de seguridad con buenos señalamientos para salvaguardad la seguridad de uno y de los compañeros la parte mas difícil es soportar el exceso de ruido, en cuanto a herramienta laboral se contaba con la suficiente y el trabajo en equipo era de excelencia"
good,"Very capable and intelligent group of people. Tremendous expertise in the field of preform and bottle processing. Department is very individualized, providing minimal ""team"" environment. The location is remote resulting in long commutes. I think it's a great company, but you must enter your position as an expect as the expectations are high, learning curve short, and teaching resources are minimal."
good,"There are two shifts each ten hours four days a week. Overtime comes unexpectedly sometimes and can last for weeks on end."
good,"A typical day was very busy, with a lot of order changes.  Many tasks had to be done quickly.  Work was very hot in the summer, with questionable air quality most of the year.  Management seemed more interested in finding ways to fire people than in helping them do their jobs better.  Very clique work environment.  If you were ""in"" you could get away without doing much.  If you weren't in, life was pretty miserable."
good,Most departments and a team aspects. Very competitive company always looking for additional market share.
good,"I have enjoyed the opportunity to work on many varying projects. My most enjoyable and challenging was learning Customs Consolidated Entry into the US for a plant closure. I scheduled and managed a 38 truck move of a Press Machine within the tight 10 day time frame. These trucks ranged from vans, flats, steps, double drops and oversize loads. The coordination took many long hours, working with several different Carriers and Customs, however was very rewarding when all trucks showed up to delivered on time with no damage!"
good,come in have safety meeting then sign on to computer then do quality check and start everything up then wait for finished product to box up for shipping while doing hourly quality checks
good,"El día comenzaba con inducción a terceros dependiendo si habían trabajos, coordinar reuniones con los jefes de área para modificar la documentación de acuerdo al OHSAS y la Ley 29783, integrando los sistemas de Inocuidad, Seguridad y Calidad; asi como capacitaciones con el personal operativo y administrativos. Verificación de los controles de seguridad, entre otros."
good,Good place to work but the employees are not paid enough for the work they do and also kind of hard to advance  in the company. It is hard to get any overtime but the work is steady.
good,Muy buen clima laboral. Desafiante respecto a los objetivos propuestos por la alta dirección. Fuerte cultura en seguridad y Calidad.
good,This is a great place to work. The company is organized and the people were great to work with. They seem to really care about their employees. Time there was great.
good,"A typical would be me arriving, getting ready to head to the floor. Once on the floor i went to my machine and began checking and packaging the product and then stacking it onto a pallet"
good,"Empresa dedicada a la elaboracion de materia prima a base de plastico, manejando conexiones con empresas como  coca cola, big cola."
good,"clock in u have to be there 15min before shift starts, 30 min lunch 12 hour shifts, standing on your feet.. so must be able to stand for hours at a time."
good,Working in this office you have to understand the employees around you. Its a very competitive environment due to being a unionized facility. Management was friendly although sometimes a lack of communication would interfere with job function.
good,It was a great place to work at.  I would have stayed there if the company did not have to shut down. I enjoyed 34 years there. The staff became like family.
good,"Bemis is a great place to work, they were listed in Forbes 500 best places to work for 2017.  Benefits are aligned with the industry.  Only issue was I could not get on the same page as management which led to my separation from the company."
good,The 21/7 schedule isn't for everyone but the pay is nice.  Friendly working environment where everyone is willing to help.  That being said management is in a sad state right now.
good,"Friendly environment, clean, climate controlled environment. Opportunity for advancement and competitive pay. Great benefits, with many extra amenities, including bonuses."
good,"Uma empresa muito preocupada com a segurança de seus funcionários. Uma ótima empresa para iniciar a carreira com grande oportunidades de aprendizado, onde o conhecimento não é individual e sempre é repassado aos mais novos."
good,"I learnt Handling Units concept which was very new to me and became expert now, of course due to hard work and continuous practice. I am not sure about the internal things about the company because I worked with this company as a cotractor."
good,"Salary and Union do not work well together. No layoffs, the business is strong. The comp and benefits are average and the company is satisfied with being average."
good,This place would be good for a lot of different people.  There is a lot of opportunity there.  Injection Molding is not an easy job to learn.  It will take years to learn and it is a job you have to be patient but I would recommend it that would like to learn a new skill.
good,The job can be very challenging at times and it requires a lot of standing climbing and kneeling throughout 12 hour shift the pay is great management is fair
good,The company is going through a cultural change throughout all functions.  Within each area of the company there are opportunities to take on new responsibility.
good,"Pay is ok"
good,sort plastic containers for quality control. perform shipping & receiving duties & maintain a clean work space. working for bemis gave me the experience in warehouse work so i can pursue more opportunities to explore options concerning my career.
good,Place was ok to work if it wasn't for managment and plant closing down. Over all place was decent most of the time. The pay was good compared to alot of other places.
good,"Empresa mundial, mas com seus defeitos como todo lugar tem."
good,Worked the 7/24 schedule which is 12 hour days 2 on 2 off 3 on the next week the opposite the hardest part of the job was trying to be in 2 or 3 places at one time
good,"I would not recommend advancing into a salaried position that can be cut as a ""cost take out"". Hourly wages are competitive for this area and are protected by a labor union."
good,Una empresa con una vision amplia para el jiro del mismo con bases muy fundadas
good,"Stay hydrated and wear cloths that you don't need. You are going to stand for eight hours. So bring comfortable shoes. Boss can be strict at times, some of them are good."
good,This is a good company to work for.  Didn't learn much but good for beginners in the field of Purchasing.  It builds a foundation for more skilled companies for the future.  There are opportunities for advancement if you are willing to wait.
good,empresa em transição cultural com dificuldade de melhoria nos processos.
good,"Bon management"
good,"Empresa Buena para desarrollarse, industria Mexicana que esta en desarrollo y forma parte de The Coca-Cola Company"
good,It was a pretty good place to work at. I liked the people I worked with. Very good pay for what is required of you. There seemed to room for job advancement. It is also a very safety orientated place. It was too bad that I was just hired at the wrong time and they lost a couple of jobs which accounted for a work slow down and permanent layoffs.
good,"We were previously Sonoco Plastics, not a lot great to say, management kept you in dark, no pay raises and dictatorship.  Amcor purchase Sonoco waiting to see results nothing great to say as of now."
good,It was an ok place to work. It was a revolving door as far as management and human resources went. This made it difficult for some people to work because every time there was a new manager they wanted to do things different.
good,"to hot , leads can be super rude. work place was to dirty "
good,"Empresa boa para se trabalha mas poderia ser bem melhor se cada setor, em suas atividades internas, fossem mais organizados para, então, haver uma interação mais fluida entre os setores promovendo o desenvolvimento e evolução no avanço da empresa."
good,Working in a plant they run very lean and sometimes lean to the point that the operations can struggle if a large in flux of business comes in on short notice. There is very few bodies in reserves if any at all to get the job done.
good,pontos bons e negativos. excesso de calor no setor de extrusão
good,you would work 7am to 7pm or 7pm to 7am with mandatory overtime when needed. High temperature environment in the summer. Very cold environment in the winter supervisor was easy going as long as you do your job no body would bother you.
good,"This is a hard position, that I am looking to get out of due to difficult people who do not complete their job tasks in a timely manner."
good,"As far as factory jobs go. Bemis manufacturing  is definitely one of the better ones. Management can be quite ridiculous at times but I think that goes for any job."
good,"A typical day at work was filled with meetings and at the end of the day would be the updates to the projects you were working on. There was little planning overall and resources were overstretched for several years. The team was good, however, there was over 100% turnover in the past year which has been difficult to manage knowledge in the available resources. The most enjoyable part of the job was the research and problem resolution and the hardest was the resources given for the timing of projects. The business changes were needed from the new CEO and he is delivering, but it is a company who has lacked change for several decades and is catching up with little resources to complete that change."
good,"Amcor is a tough place to work. Most people, especially in maintenance, work well together and try to keep the machines running.There is a lot of overtime, due to position vacancies. The company uses too many temporary workers it is having an effect on morale and plant as a whole. "
good,I worked with Bemis customers in the field of medical bottle sticker printings. I was the sole employee responsible for the medical information printed on medical stickers for medicine containers including brand logos.
good,"Decent company to work for,  pay is fair, advancement is available. Corporate mission is not people based like it used to be.  New operations directors lead by intimidation and fear.  The long standing passion and loyalty is leaving.  Talented individuals are slowly jumping ship.  Resources are being cut."
good,"Generalmente bueno, conoces a gente de muchos países con diferentes culturas, compañeros agradables, etc"
good,"Until recently, Bemis has been a solid company. With the recent change of CEO, Bemis has gone from a family oriented business to a bottom line business. A recent downsizing has the workforce uneasy. The IT group, although moving in the right direction, has suffered multiple reorganizations in the past three years. Reorganizations are occurring every 6-10 months. "
good,The hardest part of the job is keeping things together in an environment of constant change....cost price challenges....under capacity and service/ quality issues.    Company has growing pains but in 3 years may be unstoppable.
good,"muito puxado"
good,"Quality control, setting our set up the machine, production of paper bags. printing production line and packing"
good,Work varies from day to day for maintenance techs.  There are times when you work 60 + hours a week and there are times when people are asked to take off early.  Amcor is probably one of the best places to work in the area.
good,Only worked under company name for 2 years. They bought us and shut us down due to the numbers.
good,it was challenging but easy. it would get hard at some point operating more than 2 machines.
good,esta muy bien porque una semana trabajas 5 dias y la otra semana trabajabas 3
good,en tant qu'interimaire j'étais au conditionnement ou les collegues m'expliquaient  comment faire
good,"as the company its ok with money , people and place to work but after some time its good to yourself a little change with the job. its 12 hrs shifts days and nights (rotating) so its not really good for health>specially doing nightshift. its good for the strat working there but after 5 years doing that you need to change the position for yourself>"
good,"Joined at entry level and pretty much learned all from the AP Sup'r. Very professional mentor. "
good,Good job!!!! worked at a steady pace. Learned alot about shipping
good,"My days were pretty much the same everyday, I would process new and finished orders into Pronto, the companies main computer program for data collection and accounting.  I also answered the phone as we did not have a reception and this duty was shared amongst the rest of the staff within the office.  I would do the filing and archiving when it was necessary and make sure my area was tidy and clean and easy to find files should someone need to use them. "
good,"I primarily looked at improving the forecasting process. I learned how to deal with large sets of data, ambiguity and how to deal with individuals who were less than understanding and cooperative. Not an ideal location but the employees in the area where my cubicle was located seemed fairly nice and more than willing to help when I had questions."
good,"There is alot of tension between the maintenance employees and the management due to the lack of parts inventory, the increased amount of maintenance due to the lack of warehouse space, the lack of personnel due to the expansion, and the amount of forced overtime that regularly occurs.  The management seems unconcerned with the issues.  However, they pay quite well compared to competitors."
good,Empresa dedicada a la fabricación de preformas de pet principalmente dedicadas a botellas en el sector de la alimentación
good,"Like some companies there are departments that are understaffed. A typical day in the graphics area is usually stressed to meet the customers needs with a changing press schedule. Often times, it's a 8+ hour day and weekends. One needs to be flexible and understand part of it is the nature of the beast and worst when there is no backup. Management on the corporate level seems to be isolated from the day to day activities focusing on the end result. Management on the plant level needs to have a better understanding that some departments overlap and what happens with one affects the other."
good,"El trabajo en la empresa resultó especialmente duro debido a lo desafiante que resuló ser el proyecto que se quería implementar."
good,"We were friendly,looking out each other for the safety.It is depend on the job and customers,i alway enjoy my job."
good,"Amcor taught me a tremendous amount about the rigid plastics business.  I thoroughly enjoyed designing bottles and traveling to customers, troubleshooting, and problem solving.  While working at Amcor, I was able to obtain a Six Sigma Black Belt."
good,Poor quality in items produced. Management would not correct issues so people lost their jobs.
good,Worked 14 years in warehouse and shipping. No room for advancement and no pay raises for job.
good,I liked the job and position but the management at Bemis is questionable. The quality of the products they are producing is riddled with problems also. They seems to have quality issues management cannot figure out. I liked most of my coworkers.
good,"A typical day would be a 12 hour shift, could be a day shift or a night shift (Continental shifts). My company use to be a good place to work but communication and authorization has gone poor over the years. I can't see this company getting better due to the previous recession, especially with the redundancies and pay cuts. The people I work with are brilliant but the whole work place is badly run by management. I don't mind working the long hours, the fact that the money is poor is the downside. The most enjoyable part of the job has to be conversing with co-workers and working as a team."
good,O maior mau da empresa é a gerencia mau organizada.
good,You will be promoted within the department or choose to bid out. The bad thing about this job is the supervisors want their numbers and don't care about the quality.
good,"Its a up and down company moral on the shift Im on sucks  management gives the answer we will look into that  I like the work its a clean environment,"
good,I would rate it a 3 out of ten. The job itself isn't bad it the people and management that you have to deal with. That's all I have to say about it...
good,"Multinacional de grande porte, indústria no ramo de Embalagens, com várias plantas no mundo todo."
good,"Fast paced, but friendly environment to work in. Extensive troubleshooting skills required to keep the machines active, and recognize quality issuey with the product"
good,"Ótimo ambiente de trabalho."
good,"fast work pace, lots of different machine to learn from, work pays fair, nice clean workplace. lots of friendly coworkers. hardest part about work is working the 12hrs rotating swing shift"
good,"Current upper management became very financially focused (important in any business), but forgot about the people.  Financial improvement came above all else at the expense of jobs and morale."
good,"Na minha avaliação, eu indicaria essa empresa para se trabalhar."
good,"The money and benefits are great.  An operator can expect to work overtime, plus the employees are expected to be engaged as much as the management."
good,"If one remembers that this is a corporation and therefore incapable of  being anything but that, one can use it as a mechanism for providing for their family. But little else. It's driving force is to produce material, sell it, make money, and continue the cycle. Whereas at one time, they valued the peasantry, erm, employees, they now look upon them as numbers, and little very little else. That is not to say anything particularly bad about them. They are exactly as they project themselves to be. A factory."
good,"Segunda feira pois é dela que desenvolve o trabalho da semana."
good,"static for most employees. no much ladder for growth. But nice place to spend time to approach retirement. "
good,back when the Bemis family ran this company employees were happy and well taken care of. Now with non Bemis management everything is a struggle from top leadership turnover (3 new Presidents in 3 years) to operational struggles.
good,"Scheduled 12.25 hours rotating schedule every other weekend 3 day weekend.  Very fast past and can be stressful at times, trying to turn culture around.  Hours and overtime along with demands for supervisors up hardest part of job, most enjoyable 3 day weekends if your lucky enough not to have to work ot for someone."
good,A great place when I first started but they hired this guy with no plastic experience he is the worst supervisor I ever seen and the plant manger max strub is the worst plant manger ever
good,"一所創新的公司，制度尚算完善。"
good,They eventually moved all most all jobs out of state and laying off 100’s of employees .  Was a good family business for numerous years.  They recently have been bought out.
good,a job you would need to be dedicated to. they occasionally work with you on family emergencies. management is understanding. nice a clean work space and friendly co workers.
good,"La competencia ha sido muy fuerte y la rotación y los clientes han gozado el estar en un mercado de precios. "
good,"The company is committed to growth with cost take outs reviewed each quarter.  "
good,Bored most of the time unless it was month end or quarter end.  Very sexist management and the only way to advance in the finance department was if you were a male.
good,Being exposed to Purchasing and Personnel gave me a sound footing for my future.  I look back on the three years as having laid a firm foundation for my career.
good,"This company is huge internationally. It is a nice place to work as a full-time employee. They have good benefits and pay decently, with incremental raises."
good,Trabajo algo duro en ocaciones pero es buen ambiente laboral aunque hay que rolar tres turnos y es muy poco lo que pagan para tanto desgaste fisico.
good,"Co-workers got along well, management was a little stilted, somewhat of a tendency toward micro-management from the VP and Director levels."
good,work to many hours. They have got grow and do not look out for the old plant.
good,"It pays well, definitely enough for the area. If you're an entry level worker be prepared for no one to care about you after training. If you stick with it you will be fine."
good,"The pay and benifits are great."
good,I enjoyed working withe the people at Amcor while i was there was a good place to work it is very fast paced place to work you need to know how to manage your time while working there and be very alert to whats going on around you.
good,"Training isn't so good, big focus on safety, very clean place to work, management has changed over 3 times in 5 years and not for the better. Pay is pretty good."
good,Boa empresa para se trabalhar quendo se fala em organização. mas trabalhar na parte de produção é desgastante.
good,"The pay is good. It's typical 12 hour shift work. Lots of different things to work on and learn. Many, many great and knowledgeable people to work with. Unfortunately this place is ruined by a significant amount of people who are just hateful and want to see other people, and the company, fail. Despite the many good individuals working here, from janitors to management; overall the atmosphere is toxic. This job is a soul crusher."
good,A typical day at work is setting up printing presses and put them in production. I learned different printing graphics and printing techniques. Management is okay. Co-workers are great people to work with. The hardest part of the job is making sure the colors are in order and in color. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you get to see different designs to print.
good,Overall good place to work...pay is great.  Not a lot of stress and the hours are what I was looking for.  I hate that the Shelbyville Plant is shutting down.
good,A job that can be monotonous and challenging to keep up with if you are on a fast production line. However compensation and benefits are fair.
good,"twelve hour shift, learned numerous topics about how to run a tuber. co-workers and I got along well for the most part"
good,"Ambiente de trabalho dinâmico e com muitas mudanças de cultura, o que possibilitou muito aprendizado junto aos meus clientes internos."
good,"A good place to work. Numerous turnovers in management recently, still turbulent. Good benefits. Everyone gets along. New management is holding personnel accountable."
good,If u want to work there then I would suggest living halfway there because anything more than 20 miles is not worth the drive. You start out as temp and the pay is weekly but once u get on perm then u are paid bi weekly. The people are very professional and respectful but they have a point system. The pay is decent but if u work in Extrusion they have the short check and long check system which I do not like and its all 12 hr shifts. I did not like 3 on 2 off 4 on 2 off because it hurt me on bills. Over all it was a decent company and very professional but unless live less than 20 miles from the company the drive is not worth it.
good,"There was no typical day at the Bemis Center for Contemporary Arts. One day I might be throwing clay on a wall of a cave we are building, or another I might be judging an auction. I did work for 3 months manually entering the entire library of books into the online library system. We had over 3000 books that were not logged, but this was the best learning experience. Not only did I learn a lot about the artists that I was entering, I learned a lot about data entry, keeping track of entries and checked out materials. I also brought my typing skills from 34 WPM to 52WPM, and sharpened my spelling and gramar skills as well. The most enjoyable part of this job was all the hands-on work I was able to do. The hardest part was the distance I drove to be a part of this, even when I was just volunteering."
good,"They said once I complete three months I would get hired, but I have been there for four months and they fired me, basically they said to me your performance is not satisfied."
good,"Overall it was a decent place to work. I like a fast paced enviroment and Amcor is just that. The job can get hard when the days get busy, but at the end of the day you feel accomplished."
good,"The job is good, the training stinks and the amount of overtime you are required to work is ridiculous. Not enough time for family or life. The HR department isn't ran well, there is a lot of favoritism, and all the good people end up leaving or getting fired for stupid reasons. The people are over worked and under paid."
good,A empresa é muito boa de trabalhar mais tem pessoas que querem subir de cargo pisando outras pessoas e isso eu não concordo.
good,Used to be a fun place to work but lately it seems that it is more about the profit and less about the people causing the culture to shift negative. Used to be fun!
good,Good company overall. Workers could use an attitude change. Managers need to be more aware of the needs of work place. Training needs to be more encompassing. Senior employees need to be more open to teaching newer members.
good,Not really sure what to say here for everyone expects and accepts different thoughts on thier needs so only thing that comes to mind is        What is Normal for a spider is Chaos for a fly
good,was a good place to work. Employees were treated fairly. Job was not hard.The hardest part of the job was getting use to working 12 hours a day.

good,Easy work and fun enviorment very easy to get ahead and full of nice people
good,"Es una empresa que tiene buenas prestaciones, pero los directivos o personal a cargo de personal no impulsan el crecimiento ni mejoras laborales, muchos puestos se dan por conveniencia o por compadrazgo dejando de un lado los años de experiencia y nivel académico, desmotivando al personal que cumple con sus labores y responsabilidades."
good,"There all the time in maintance, pay is really good but no time to enjoy the money. Short handed not enough people in the field. Managed not good at all they don’t care about you what so ever"
good,"I would arrive at work a little before 6 a.m  many times before the others I worked with. I sorted and staged product that I was going to be working with. During the process of staging the product I used a sit down forklift to transport the product. Being safety conscience, I would use the horn to let the people know I was coming out from behind taller product, and I would get yelled at for using my horn to many times by a so called safety crew member. Management was a pleasure to work with. I learned what was defective product and what was not. The most enjoyable part of the job was the relaxed atmosphere besides the bad seed I sometimes had to work with."
good,"Amcor is a fast paced, Safety oriented company which puts its employees first. Amcor invests in its employees and encourages self growth as well as growth within the company."
good,"All in all not a bad company to work for, but work 12 hour nights every day is hard to get used to. The work itself is not very hard, unless you create more work for yourself."
good,I've learned that I can accomplish anything that I set my mind to. I work as an operator on the production floor and help out in the supervisor's office running the production floor with all the ins and outs that come along with that. I enjoy the different problems that arise and figuring out a way to get them solved.
good,"Place wasn't bad to work at, it was hot, and I didn't like forced ot on 12 hour shifts. Plus In my opinion they did not promote safety above all. Pay was tops for area"
good,it was a great job only thing that i had a problem with was the abusive of authority and never followed procedure . they couldn't keep no one they always would quit because the way the ran the crew .but soon after i left they fired the crew leaders that was the trouble so i think i would recommend it to someone else as long as it under new management.
good,"It's not bad if you are working with people of similar interests.  If you don't get along with your coworkers, it is terrible.  The biggest downside is management.  Most of them are completely incompetent and think everyone is replaceable."
good,The job was fun at times. People were in and out the door on a weekly basis. It was hard to get used to work partner. The management was constantly changing the rules and regulations. Pay was good. The hours were not.
good,"Aprendizado sobre segurança no trabalho."
good,Eu aprendi a ter auto controle em certas situacoes
good,"A empresa é excelente em termos de relacionamento interpessoal, todos os diretores e gerentes estão sempre com as portas abertas."
good,"Competitividad, Exigencia, Respeto. Es una empresa con nuevos proyectos a Desarrollar"
good,"Good place to work "
good,"The 12 hour rotating shifts can be very grueling, but the pay is rewarding. In most cases you have to wear a hairnet and steel toe shoes while in production areas, which can be uncomfortable at times."
good,I was hired in as a line operator in the extrusion blow molding department.  After 9 weeks of training.  I ran a line on night shift.  I then transferred to maintenance.
good,This company is a great place to start a career. Does not have much development for some functional areas. There is some flexibility in hours at corporate.
good,"I have learned so much about manufacturing environment while working at Bemis. The ink process, quality process and material handling while at Bemis. The work place culture is great and the people that work there are very nice people to work with."
good,"Em toda a trajetória tive um crescimento na empresa, no entanto a gestão em si era pouco capacitada e corrigida para que viesse a dar mais resultados a empresa."
good,Not a bad place to work but the management is very poor. The job is a bit repetitive but its easy work and the pay and benefits are well worth it. The worst part is how management doesn't communicate to you at all.
good,"Amcor has been a very good company to work for.  The past two years have been challenging due to management and structural changes within the organizations.  Each new level of management wants to better understand the business so is very needy and requires additional time to provide the data they need.  It has been exhausting at time."
good,I think they should pay more for how hot it is there. They don't let you smoke on your breaks. But they do make you work at a fast pace and I really enjoyed that part of it
good,Good place to do work and very healthy environment for the workers. Helping staff and co workers always willing and ready to help each other in every condition.
good,"O dia a dia na empesa é muito dinâmico, o que gera oportunidade de aprendizagem e constante desenvolvimento profissional."
good,A good company overall. I have nothing against Amcor but do have other values. My job as maintenance manager in this facility was a 24/7 affair and I live an hour away. I am the only child of my mother who now needs constant care. I am great full to Amcor for the opportunity provided to me. Simply I must put family first and find something closer with less demand thru this time.

good,Empresa para grande poder de aprendizado e oportunidade de crescimento profissional para jovens funcionários.
good,"12 hour shifts of either straight nights or straight days.  You work a 2-2-3 schedule so you only work half of the year, and you get paid weekly.  Everybody is easy to get along with, and they have competitive benefits."
good,"ótimo ambiente de trabalho, facilidade na comunicação com a liderança"
good,"a well paying job with plenty of days off in theory."
good,"the hours suck and the people are terrible to work for, but the money and over time is worth it. I was told they never lay off, but I still ended up getting laid off"
good,long hours you can work overtime they treat the temps nit fair an sometimes they know more then the fulltime employees the management is ok it can be hard job on some days
good,"Bemis is a good place to work if you enjoy working. There are many opportunities for overtime, and it is actually encouraged and rewarded to take extra shifts, unlike many places where I have worked. The only drawbacks are the long hours and consecutive days. It will feel like all you do is work."
good,"Enjoyed working with and for so many great people including both my union production floor co-workers and the local management team. I learned so much so fast and I hope our efforts to improve Safety continue to this day! Remember, Safety is non-negotiable!"
good,"Amcor Rigid Plastics has been an excellent company to work for.  They offer an environment for gaining knowledge in many areas of the packaging industry.  I have enjoyed my time with Amcor Rigid Plastics, but would like to expand my career into other laboratory opportunities that may not be offered by this company"
good,"same as Lone Star, company changed names and managment every two-three years. This caused a problem for me working with this company."
good,Fast paced work environment.  The people is what really drives this organization.  Leadership is engaged and empowers employees throughout all levels of the organization.
good,"Facilidade em relacionamento com os pares e principalmente com a alta Direcao. Voltada para o resultado, mas com condicoes de inovar em busca dos objetivos propostos."
good,"Não existe maneiras de crescimento interno, porem, é um otima empresa, com bons beneficios."
good,"Nice people to work with and great atmosphere."
good,"Boa empresa, ofereceu oportunidade, de boa convivência, bom ambiente."
good,The overall outcome of the company is very intriguing. To learn and watch how things are processed for start to finish. The employee are very friendly which makes for a good day at the office.
good,Enjoyed working at Amcor.The benefits and pay were above normal.
good,"Daily work involved set up of machines operations and quality control as well as packaging. Upper management was a joke, always being replaced never stable in upper management. Crew leaders and supervisors were great, fun to work with and were always willing to help troubleshoot any problems."
good,Day starts with forklift check and continues on with orders I need to load for the day. As I load Trailers product is produced for stocking so I must multi-task.
good,"Very clean, safe and friendly place. 12 hour shifts. Co-workers are very friendly and like family. Goals to be met on a daily basis. Management is respectful. Hardest part of my job is short breaks. Enjoyable part of my job, is the pay. "

good,"Great company sponser events, good benefits, small town location."
good,"Direct Quote From Bemis Company, Inc. Website: ""Through employee volunteerism, corporate sponsorships, and monetary donations, Bemis helps enrich communities and continues to carry on a tradition of giving back that began so long ago."""
good,"Willing to help learn new job skills, and focus on job specific goals. Nice area to work if you dont like the big city feel."
good,"Le travail esr bien,,  manque d organisation pour le travail de nuit"
good,Empresa bacana porém tem supervisores que não dão oportunidade aos funcionários internos
good,"I ran a machine, I did quality checks, inspected bags, I packed boxes, fixed the machine when it would break down, I would lace the plastic thru the machine, clean, would put all the specs in the computer, I would do measurements. I learned how to make bags. The hardest part of my job was fixing the machines. l really enjoyed learning how to make bags"
good,Boa empresa.  Boa equipe de trabalho.
good,"Hard job, long hours, high stress.  Benefits are great as well as pay.  Management is management they have rules and goals to meet. You can move up if you are liked by management."
good,Fast paced. Learned to fill out paperwork for different work orders. Safe workplace. Only bad thing was rotating shifts. Work 21 days off for 7. Hardest part of the job was repetition.
good,Bemis was an amazing place to work until they merged with Amcor...I always heard Bemis was the place to work if you were looking for a place to retire from. Unfortunately my plant underwent plantwide layoffs immediately following the merger.
good,"Good place to be employed, good benefits."
good,"Direct Manager was fantastic, but work/life balance non-existent. Company making a lot of changes, but good changes that will move the company forward."
good,"Training can be hit or miss. Have to ask alot of questions. They could benefit from having certified trainers. People with patience who follow a set training schedule. Some of the people training do not communicate well."
good,"After 19 years of service where I intended to retire, the micromanagement of my superiors detracted from the previous enjoyment of going to work. I still enjoy what I do but having non-mechanical people evaluate your experience, procedural duties and time management deflates ones ambition to continue at a high level of accomplishment. When the perception that someone in an authoritative position of responsibility gets in the way of their ego and eyesight, trouble is soon to appear. My 19 years of consistent job performance, expertise, wisdom and passion for continual learning was cast aside like it was completely irrelevant to the continued success of the company. Upon termination from my position, as of midnight that day, all benefits of insurance for me and my family were canceled. The company says they care about your well being until they don't and you are essentially dead to them."
good,"Colaboradores não são avaliados por sua capacidade e sim pela questão de amizade com a gestão, o profissional não é medido pelo seu conhecimento,é medido pela influência no meio dos superiores. As seleções são feitas por escolhas e não por mérito. O que acaba desmotivando a maioria dos profissionais."
good,"Good place to work with the exception of upper corporate management and HR department and their ""friends"".  Very unprofessional HR department and I witnessed a lot of shady situations including they always ""worked from home"".  They did not want anyone to succeed unless you were a favorite."
good,"E uma empresa   muito  boa, precisa dar mais oportunidades aos seus colaboradores"
good,Bemis sales are down and many plants are closing with many job losses. Many employees don't see the sense of urgency to run the company better.  Many functional departments lack using best practices which could improve there ability process work through the organization.
good,Worked for 5 years for this company. Great Pay and benefits but management turnover and inability to advance through company makes it seem like your stuck
good,Work days are busy and go by fast. Management is inexperienced but has your back. The overall culture is good. Most jobs are typically easy and not challenging. The people are good to work with.
good,"Muitas mudanças ocorrem nas empresa, o que gera oportunidades."
good,Referente a companhia e a sua política tende a ser uma ou se não a melhor entre as companhias estabelecidas no Brasil. Porém especificamente a gerencia industrial a qual estava me reportando não dava a significância a segurança dos colaboradores visando sempre a produção a qualquer custo.
good,A empresa contém um ambiente muito tranquilo e agradável para se trabalhar.

good,Amcor Rigid Plastics offered a great salary and good benefits. I worked 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. 6 days a week. For the most part I liked the job and the people I worked with.
good,Overall it was a great place to work but job security was not achieved by the company. I did enjoy the active lifestyle type activities they promoted such as daily stretching.
good,O trabalho era muito repetitivo e não davam muitas oportunidades de crescimento e faltou um pouco de incentivo no crescimento pessoal. Um excelente ambiente de trabalho. E ótimo relacionamento da direção e colaboradores.
good,"Good company, makes quality product.  Good people, enjoy working in the plant atmosphere.  Good teamwork.  Difficult to balance plant goals with overall corporate goals at times."
good,"Its pays goods, good benefits, paid vacation, and floating holiday pay"
good,Poca interés por capacitación al personal y su vez dar promoción monetaria
good,"ambiente agradável com colegas legais. Calor excessivo no meu setor."
good,"empresa boa para trabalhar, cultura boa e ambiente bom para se trabalhar."
good,No stable leadership. Managers flowing in and out every few months. Supervisors and workforce not involved enough in helping resolve production issues.
good,"Ámbito laboral muy bueno, la empresa tiene mucha calidad humana. El día a día es muy confortable. "
good,the pay was ok but a very mundane workplace the people working there were friendly and the environment was relaxed but I had to work with chemicals that were dangerous
good,One of the leading flexible packing companies in the valley. They produce packaging as a leader in the industry. The hardest part of the job as a maintenance planner was that of balancing a harmonious balance between production and sales.
good,A typical day at work is watching machines and ensuring they work properly.  Most days work is pretty steady pace.  It is difficult becoming an permanent employee.
good,"Office type setting, have your own cubicle.  Fast paced and always busy.  Schedule your work and plan you workload.  Not micromanaged.  Supervisors are helpful."
good,I found it quite interesting how much effort it took to create high volumes of labels for the beverage industry. Also what was interesting was the process itself.
good,Bemis is a solid company that is willing to promote the careers of it's employees through training and movement. The company is ethical and the work culture is generally positive.
good,"As an EBM Operator my day would be diagnosing machines and getting them back up and running. I learned a lot about hydraulic pumps, cylinders and valves, and pneumatic cylinders and valves. The management relied on mechanics to get quality products."
good,"A empresa oferece um certo nível de liberalidade. Tem ótimos benefícios e salário."
good,Hours was cut not getting the overtime I need. Good money but it just looks like the doors are closing so I am looking for something to get more hours.
good,"Working for Amcor was my first job, I had a great overall experience. I liked my co-workers, and my hours. I was only on as a temp, but loved my time there."
good,Management doesn't treat all their employees the same within the department regarding workload.  If the director of the department likes you there are opportunities for advancement.
good,"Scheduling jobs and ensuring production machine were up and running, checking on consumables and ordering when required. troubleshooting machine issues, attending management meetings, facilatating Tool Box meetings"
good,una compañía bastante organizada y orgullosa de sus logros
good,"Had lots of opportunity to learn here. Company has a high level of dedication to EHS. Saw it demonstrated by word, deed and capital investment. Worked with dedicated people for the most part. Good place to work overall."
good,repititieve maar intensieve job. Toffe collegas die hulp bieden waar nodig
good,"Very fast paced job, you work a lot of hours but have rotations. Over time is not mandatory. The management is supportive and most seem to care. Great benefits and pay."
good,It allowed me to privide for my family working 6 12 hr days a week on night shift made it hard to balance a family life unless i barely slept.  Pay was nice but we are getting let go since they are shutting the plant down
good,"Some of the nicest people to work with as far as a factory goes, very laid back or fast paced- hard to get an even flow sometimes, the management treats the workers very well"
good,"friendly supervisors, not always behind you. training on state of the art machinery and equipement, good work place culture and christmas party every year."

good,"I worked in this organisation for 28 years and was mostly content"
good,"I don't believe that I was at this company long enough to give a proper review. They were a great company to work for, for the short time I was employed there."
good,"Bemis provides a fast paced environment whereby learning from customers, employees and management is available every day all day."
good,"You come in and go to the area you work and get everything you need for the day ready. I learned more of the inspection area part of the company after coming in as a fork lift operator. Management is okay, you have your good ones and the ones you think are good buy only look out for themselves and their friends interests. My co-workers were awesome, a lot like myself."
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced.Got to be proactive at all times.Can get stress full and demanding at times."
good,I believe that they should give more people opertunities to advance and show their drive. They have  a lot of temporary people that are actually good workers but never given the chance ti show this.
good,"operated forklifts on 12hr shifts, loaded and unloaded bottles onto the trucks, very good night crew, but very long hrs."
good,"Enter invoices in SAP"
good,Loved the Job. However not enough hours on off season.
good,"My role was varied, no two days being the same."
good,Great company. It pays you enough to live comfortably with. Good employees and great office workers. I didnt enjoy working 3rd shift but I found ways to spend time with my family.
good,E uma presa boa tem um ambiente  ótimo mas dão pouco  chance de cresimento
good,dommage que la société soit fermée suite a un dépôt de bilan
good,"Durante meus 11 anos na empresa foi muito gratificante e agradável de se trabalhar, pois a empresa visa muito a segurança e o bem estar dos funcionários, porém peca no reconhecimento."
good,I worked there for more than two decades.  So they must have done something right!  The pay and benefits were good!  And of course the higher the pay the more work and responsibility you have. More than enough overtime.  Raised my kids during the duration of my employment there.  Would still be there if the plant hadn't relocated out of state.
good,Empresa com bom ambiente para se trabalhar e com cobranças diárias. Um aprendizado muito grande para o mercado.
good,"Excellent Company, with outstanding potential"

good,"Empresa de embalagens flexíveis e rígidas, boa para trabalhar."
good,"Gostei do tempo em que trabalhei na empresa , gostaria de ter tido oportunidades de mostrar melhor meu trabalho."

good,"Amcor is a good employer. I worked there for ten years and had a good relationship with Management, co-workers and customers. I enjoyed the challenge of my job and the autonomy to do my job."
good,"This is a pretty standard place to work with a relaxed atmosphere and management that cares. On the flip side, the pay is below average. Now I'm just writing words to get to the limit..."
good,Bemis has great insurance and pay. Management is a solid good group of people that have been in their positions for a long time. I truly love working here but our plant is closing down and three others are scheduled to close up north.
good,"amcor is a good choice for those in the factory area of work, slow paced most of the time with fair scheduling and breaks, good management except for 1 or 2 bad apple supervisors"
good,"A Empresa fornece aos seus colaboradores autonomia para tomada de decisões, muitos desafios, contribuindo para o aprendizado e crescimento profissional."
good,"I grew a lot on this job I'm one of 8 people to work on and run the sp1000 in the world . Fast pace clean and safe place to work , great pay and never had many problems."
good,"12 hour shifts with 3 paid 20 minute breaks.  "

good,"I enjoy working at Bemis Company. It's a place where I have advanced my knowledge not only in the flexible packaging industry, but also improving my problem solving skills critical thinking."
good,"Safety is at the top of the facility I worked at.  Great safety culture, very employee driven..safety is a priority with it's workforce.  Adequate training and compensation in the union plant I worked at.  Lots of employee involvement, very strong safety culture with excellent record."
good,"I worked at Amcor for  11 years and enjoyed the workplace. It was sometimes stressful but the job got done. I had some troubles with supervisors, the workload was long and tiresome."
good,Bemis is a good comany to work for and has provided for me and my family. Bemis offers good benefits and they pay is decent.
good,Overall a good place to work with many opportunities to advance and an extremely safety minded company. Many cuts and changes lately that have decreased the culture and security of employees working there.
good,Working at bemis healthcare taught me the importance of combings working safe with quality and production. A normal day consisted of working closely with co-workers to achieve a common goal
good,"Amcor is a great place to work but requires a lot of sacrifices and time away from your family. The people are fun to work with and the safety culture there is really big."
good,"Reviewed any issues with technician I was relieving, and did a round of quality checks to ensure what was running is in speck."
good,Bemis was a great place to work for 8 hour days minimum 6 days a week most of the time fun environment fairly easy job if you know what your doing but other in that there is not much to tale about Bemis
good,Very good learning experience with very good management. I did not enjoy the work schedule but was very happy with the pay.
good,"Daily routines consisted of coming in and doing my bottle checks to make sure machines were running well and production was set to correct specifications for the given job. I would use a fork lift to fill a hopper filled with the correct preforms and perform maintenance when needed. Management were very respectful and helpful and the coworkers were just as informative when it came to learning something new. The hardest part was making sure no deformed bottle got shipped out but that was also the most enjoyable aspect because not only did I do quality inspections, I also had to be on point and very observable."
good,"Shipping and receiving, BOL, scheduling. Good work force, unfortunately plant relocated to allentown, PA.  Was offered same position but travel would have been over 80 miles each way."
good,"Worked in one of their smaller facilities and, due to this, I was able to become very involved in many aspects of the business and management of the product, brand, and customer relationships. Amcor's first value is safety and they stick to this extremely well. Many policies were in place to manage safety, repeatability, and high level of quality. Amcor is an incredible company to work for within the manufacturing field."
good,"Well run and high effective mgmt. team.  Provides room for promotion if you work and produce.   "
good,Fun people to be around. Upper management cut long term managers to save a buck. Not good work practices and lost all the personnel with knowledge.  Plant just went thru major growth and they expected major profits within the first 6 months after spending millions and increasing staff over 50% with little to no training.
good,"Strong, secure business. Excellent work force, very fair wages and benefits. Plenty of advancement opportunities for hourly workforce. Plant has plans for expansion and growth."
good,"Gosto muito de trabalhar aqui, eu como Técnico de segurança tenho apoio e posso desenvolver meu trabalho de forma completa."

good,Empresa dinâmica e agradável de trabalhar ótima remuneração.
good,multiple jobs a day. The facility was very safe conscientious and very clean. the training program was very good. the hardest part of the job was the 12 hour shifts and working 3 day weekends.
good,"Bemis is a long standing private family owned business, but now that the Bemis family has no real members left there has been a lot of turnover with upper management which is hurting the custom injection molding side of the business"
good,"Empresa muito boa, foi uma ótima experiência de 8 anos e 5 meses, não tenho nada a reclamar."
good,This is a good company to work for but the on site plant conditions working there in the summer are dismal as the heat can reach 110 degrees. The overall company is very good and the supervisors and leads are professional. Amcors benefits are excellent.
good,"Work and home life balance is good, working 12hr shifts on 2 days 2 nights Rota with 4 off. Management are decent. Good holidays and Christmas off. Job security not the best at the mo. Excellent safety record. 4 on 4 off shifts are good although long days . Breaks given are too short tho."

good,Bemis proporciona um ambiente agradável e dinâmico para os funcionários trabalharem.
good,People took time to train you.  Lot of teamwork was involved. Management was fair and reasonable.  Learned a lot about the equipment and got a lot of good experience throughout the plant. Co-workers were nice to work and talk with.
good,Bemis is a large company and its easy to become a number there however if you have good attendance and dont slack off you will stand out and move up the ladder fast.  Shift/Department supervisors are great. Upper management however changes alot and they stuggle with communication. Pay and benifits are above average and the work is not hard. Coworkers are great and its overall a enjoyable place to work.
good,É uma empresa organizada bons padrão de qualidade e técnico
good,Empresa que estima pelos colaboradores em educação. Incentiva à estudar. Muito Boa a experiência de trabalhar na Bemis.
good,"Empresa com ótimas instalações com totais condições para os colaboradores realizarem suas atividades especificas com segurança dentro dos padrões exigidos pelas leis trabalhistas,"
good,"This is a fast place work . I really enjoyed it. Hr. Dept. Is well, training can get a little better but they do train you the basics to work out the bugs and excell in your position."
good,"autonomie , la confiance, débrouillardise ,évaluation de problème"
good,Too many favorites no chance for the ones that actually gave 110% money was great but hours really sucked plus they force you to work holidays even if its not your scheduled day
good,"Comecei a talhar na empresa Bemis em 13 de janeiro de 2014 como auxiliar de produção, com o meu desempenho em 9 meses na empresa, recebi uma promoção para exercer a função de operador de máquinas,  onde trabalhe até  3 julho de 2017"
good,"Amcor is a good company to work for.  They believe in safety above all else with Quality being a very close second.  If things are not right, they enable the teams to change the environment for the better."
good,"Recomendo fortemente esta empresa. Tem uma cultura empresarial bem alinhada. Oferece projeto de crescimento para os funcionários. Todos gestores são muito bem treinados. Salário acima do mercado."
good,"Amcor did a good job at taking care of the employees. The management made sure to always have a clean lunch room with vending machines, water, ice and more."
good,"Empresa retadora, llena de oportunidades para desarrollarte y aprender. Nunca te aburres."
good,"When I started 7 years ago this company was great. The pay is very good, great people to work with. The business has slowed down and now is running on a skeleton crew."
good,"Shift rotation 12 hour shifts was grueling but rewarding , Time off and pay rate were good and you had a feeling of pride in delivering a quality product in a timely fashion . I would still be there if not for plant closing."
good,I enjoyed working at Bemis. Coworkers have been good to work with. Pay and Benefits are good. Mgmt culture has been on decline. There's been a constant pressure from upper level leaders to grow business that they are losing touch with employees.
good,"Empresa que nos da condições de trabalho, ferramentas, suporte e autonomia para agilizar as compras."

good,"In my early years at Amcor, I started as an attendant packing bottles.  Throughout time I then advanced to being a quality inspector to working in Shipping and Receiving. I then became a Shipping Clerk.  A typical day at work would be picking orders, setting appointments for pick-ups, filing, talking to customer service on orders, preparing labels for UPS and FedEx on a daily basis.  Everything I learned about Shipping and Receiving I had learned at Amcor.  I learned different programs/software, and many trainings to complete certification in the job I did.  The people at Amcor were friendly and excellent colleagues to work with.  The hardest part of the job was leaving Amcor after many years."
good,Worked on many projects that improved the flow of Production.
good,A typical day at Amcor Rigid Plastics is very busy. Expected to do a lot of work for the time that you have. Very long days to get everything done. Needed to be very organized because of interruptions all the time. Management is very demanding. Not always understanding. Co-workers were great. Always willing to help with a problem. Hardest part of the job was working for more than one person and different personalities.
good,A empresa oferece bons benefícios e um bom salário.
good,"O dia de trabalho geralemente é rotineiro , as preventivas são seguidas diariamente por um cheklist. Aprendi como funciona todo o sistema de uma empresa, a ter responsabilidades e organização."
good,"Regretfully, my job was cut due to cost restructuring & downsizing at this plant."

This position is a great position because everyday you are dealing with numbers and math.  The co-workers are wonderful, and I have a great relationship with all of them.  This position requires a lot of multi-tasking, and the most important aspect of this position is being very detail-oriented.  Every number entered into the inventory system has to match perfectly.  The most enjoyable part of my job is doing it effectively and efficiently every day.  I need to look out for myself in terms of my future career, and I can not wait for Bemis to hire me full-time so that is the reason that I am looking elsewhere right now."

good,"Is a large company, is focused on the packaging market is competitive and has one of the most modern Prepress sector in the world. "
good,"I liked working for Bemis personally the 12 hr shifts aren't for everyone, but it didn't bother me. The people up there were great the benefits the best I had working anywhere so far. I haven't had many jobs I'm the type if i like the job i'll set up camp not so much  shop around.In the utility department you would freeze a bit in the winter sweating on the other hand was practically mandatory.The hardest part of the job i guess would be playing catch up from small back to back jobs or someone giving it 45 to 50 percent, and not so much the whole 100.I learned more than i thought i learned a lot about my co workers.The only thing i wish would be the whole lay off i would've stayed probably till i had to retire it was really a great place to have worked."
good,This particular job was in the supply chain area.  My manager believed in trust and integrity and I was allowed to work from home whenever necessary due to my husband's illness ( he is now deceased).  I was allowed to make decisions that were backed by my manager which greatly helped me to establish policies and procedures necessary for the implementation of SAP.
good,"In a typical day at Amcor, I operated machines at palletizers to assemble and package bottles for shipments."
good,"While working at Amcor Rigid Plastics, I learned about the injection molding process. I am a Machine Operator 2, which means I learned how to start and shut down Husky injection molding machines. A typical day at work would be that I pulled boxes on a set of machines checked quality and restarted any machines that broke cycle. Started up machines or shut down machines that were scheduled to go down, I did process verifications and best in class on all machines running to color parts to lab to make sure they were in specafication acording to customers needs. Worked as a valued team member with a reputation for a strong work ethic."
good,Amcor is a great company to work for with excellent benefits and above average pay scale. The Chicago plant  is a small on-site facility so each team has to wear multiple hats and work together to get the job done.
good,"I worked there nine years. Saw managers come and go. Had personal issues with the last manager because he and I worked together with him as my lead before he became manager. He became manager and he changed my shift to an inferior shift even though I had seniority to most of my coworkers. Then he started writing me up for stupid little things that everyone did daily. Corporate was no help, so I  resigned."
good,Great place to work. The work environment was great and enjoyed the people and management. Everyone was knowledgeable and easy to talk to. Would recommend this job to anyone.
good,I spent 28 years working for Bemis Company. Bemis is a great company to work for. People who say it isn't demanded more than was necessary. I started out in a secretarial pool and worked up to a managerial position in less than 10 years. Bemis offers opportunity for advancement if you're willing to work for it.

You can't ask for more, I'm extremely grateful for the opportunity to have employment with Amcor. I can't stress their enough about their Safety over everything.

The company moved still not over the affect of the company leaving Philadelphia. I don't want to really talk about it anymore. Because of what this did to so many people. The Philadelphia plant was one of the best plants they had. Whoever made the decision to close the doors in Philadelphia should know that it was a mistake. I hope that person or persons don't still work for them. Because of the fact of the really poor idea that was.

The most enjoyable part of my job was being around the people that made amcor an enjoyable place to work."
good,"i would get to work and turn the machines on and get them warmed up for the days work. i then would check in with the packhouse manager find out the orders for the day. id spend the rest of the day running around the machinery keeping them loaded with glue and cardboard and making sure they are running correctly. if machine has problems i would try and figure it out if possible, or a call to the engineer and the machine would soon be back up and running. i would always watch the engineer fixing the problems so if it happened again i would be able to fix it on my own if possible."

good,Amcor is a great place to work.  When I get to work we have 5 minute safety meetings to let everyone know whats going on and if something went wrong they let us know how to make it not happen again.  I have nothing bad to say about the management team or HR dept they have all treated me with respect and kindness to whatever problem I may have had.  Sometimes the job can get a little stressful when you are short staffed and machines break down.  Mostly all the people I work with are friendly and kind and will help you out if you have a question. I sadly feel like it may be time to move on to a different job due to differences with some people I do work with. I would rather lead a healthy lifestyle then be stressed out and upset because I care about what other people think. I am currently on night shift and looking to get onto a dayshift work week.
