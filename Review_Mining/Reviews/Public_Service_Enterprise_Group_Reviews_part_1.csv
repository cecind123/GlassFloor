rating,review
bad,"Minorities do not receive fair treatment and are only hired to meet the diversity initiatives and then treated unfairly.  HR spearheads this mentality as the Directors follow the directions of the Sr Leaders.  If you are a minority, please do not expect to grow in your role.  However, please expect to be overworked, under paid and bullied."
bad,This was the worst experience of my life. I would not recommend working here. They treat you like slaves and no room for advancement. The management here is horrible .
bad,No room for growth. Poor management. No clear path to advance your career. Work life balance not great either. Too much politics. Upper management hold grudges. Not empowered to challenge their decisions.
bad,"Everyday is a fire drill. Home land security removed most of TCS outsourced developers which was the work force. Inexperience management team cannot mange, retain or hire resources. Toxic environment people dread going to work their. Internal employee's from other departments will not apply for any job in IT . The PSEGLI department is run by PSEG NJ which has zero knowledge of the 40+ year mainframe system. There are 7 developer contractors left that can work on the old systems and they have 3 PM employees., with 30+ projects in the Customer area alone."
bad,"Experienced a work culture full of favoritism, racism. "
bad,"This is not a place to work and get recognition. The positions are given to best friends, family even if they have no skills. My manager had not IT background whatsoever and it was much harder to explain and make her understand how troubleshooting works."
bad,"This company doesn't have any work life balance. Their HR Team is a revolving door. If you can't keep the people that are supporting the people, how do you expect to run a sufficient organization. Perhaps like other companies, where they encourage you to speak up and talk about the problems. There are hardly solutions, and trust me - the ones that speak up are ousted. This company has hundred year old work processes."
bad,A very sleazy outfit. The rip off the consumers as well as the workers. They are dishonest.  All the good jobs are going to New Jersey. They do not care about Long Island or its people.
bad,"I must say I was shocked to see the high reviews this company has been receiving.  However, I guess it depends on the group and where you were working for them.  I worked in both the Newark and South Plainsfield offices.  I did not experience any of the positive things I see stated in other more positive reviews.  Management in these offices is poor, especially mid level managers.  They do not treat their employees with any type of respect, do not stand behind them, or try to help them advance in their careers.  Basically they spend their time pointing fingers, passing blame, and gossiping.  Upper management allows this, so I cannot exactly think highly of them either.  Some people are given flexibility, while most are not.  It depends on the manager/director you are under.  In most cases, if there is a snow emergency, people are forced to drive into the office or take vacation days.  These are not line workers or required personel during emergencies. We are talking corporate positions."
bad,"Company is in a decline...energy markets are driving a very poor environment.  "
bad,"not safe for a woman unhealthy environment.  Sexist and alot of drunks.Never was taught properly and blamed for things because of my gender, never gave me a fair chance."
bad,"Subcontractors not well supported by IT or management. Internal personnel use subcontractors to achieve goals.  Typical day is collecting data from field locations, submitting summary reports to senior management, training internal personnel on use of software and improving processes for collecting and reporting data.  Meeting is scheduled to align field locations to roadmap for data collections. Set goals for next day. Follow timeline for data submission until project is complete."
bad,Long Days.  Forced Unpaid Overtime.  Limited growth opportunities and no development                                                   Not Recommended
bad,"Everything regarding this company revolves around the 'not my job, can't help you'. philosophy. There's a certain faction of IT management that actually enjoys spreading as much misery as possible. Their CONSTANT corporate re-orgs are often designed to force a portion of their workforce to quit. It is a culture of CYOB or get the shaft by corporate drones. Truly an exercise in daily misery control."
bad,Stay away if you are not willing to stand against unethical behavior. There is culture of corruption and short term gain. Do not expect employees to be honest.
bad,"I have nothing decent to say about this company however, I did work for three attorneys that treated me very well, which doesn't say much when a company is as large as PSE&G. If your not a V.P. you are garbage to them."
bad,"Go to the shoemaker, pick up lunch, clean the closets and come in with a smile. I hated working for this company, there was no room for advancement.  Co-workers stabbed you in the back, you had to be part of a certain click, a lot of yelling and a very disrespectful place to work."
bad,"PSEG Nuclear pays well but a great cost to the individual. There is absolutely developmental opportunities here. The culture preaches ""Develop You"" yet every management person in my department is an external hire."
bad,"Terrible management, back stabbing, egos, and HR cannot do anything about it.  Harassment on the job.  Overworked and treated POORLY."
bad,Worked 26 years at PSEG but was treated badly the last 7 years under Exelon's management contract.  Was not treated with respect and the management team want to push out any long-term PSEG employees.
bad,Lack of management at all levels. Lack knowledge and understanding of improving performance. Majority of workers cannot communicate without the use of vulgarity.
bad,No work life balance - thankfully pay was great    HR managers in Newark & Hancocks Bridge were horrendous   No clue what they were doing.   Very little support
bad,I feel that this job is for someone more on the lazy side. I always need and ask for more work. I don't feel like I'm used to my full potential. I often wonder why they hired me.
bad,Management were not fully supportive when resolving big issues. The environment was extremely stressful.  Management was not very helpful in assisting on the on boarding process.  The process took more than 60 days.
bad,New Company with hand picked managers that are not ready to manage. no people skills and favoritism. Attempting to force At-Will employees out to hire contractors at a lower wage.
bad,"Micromanaging company where all decisions are made at the top. Set in the heart of Newark, NJ where there is a lot of crime. Not a safe place. Very unstructured and most people are unhappy with their career and management."
bad,"Not much to say here.  I would prefer to work in an industry that I am happy to support.  I am not a novelist, so I have to fill the rest of this with padding"
bad,"The management in the Real Estate and Facility department is clueless. They offered no help, training and never made time if you expressed concerns. I saw my manager less than an hour or two a week. Repeated asking training  and for assistance with concerns was brushed off."
bad,"HR are biggest offenders of company values, which they hold workforce to. Managers serving on the interview panel to hire their children.  no work life"
bad,"Don't do it. Company culture is not welcoming. Management needs better training. A great deal of office politics, I would avoid at all costs. Try another department or another company all together."
bad,"Not a fun place to work.  People and culture is not open.  Everyone works on a silo, no teamwork spirit.  The work life balance doesn't really exist.  The IT department is running very thin with most of the work offshore to India.  Leadership is not in sync with their personnel, it is culture driven by a one man decision, that is never to be challenged."
bad,"Every year we attended an all hands meeting where the Plant Manager told us that if we didn't become more financially competitive, we would not have jobs. When I specifically asked what I could do in my position,  the answer was to continue what I'm doing. Since leaving the company, there has become a big social media push to convince the public of the importance of nuclear power electrical generation. Management has been subpar when it comes to long-term direction. They continuously use generic statements that are intended to mitigate any fear of shutdown, but appear to have no real plan."
bad,"I put in 9 good years of work, where my opinions and expertise were respected; then the company decided to outsource my position to eliminate its place in the organizational hierarchy as well as to save money.  i was offered a severance package but was also forced to sign an agreement that forbade me from applying with the company again after my separation. ironically the company that took over my position is now in the process of unwinding all its consultant positions because of ""anomalies"" and ""irregularities"" in their work conduct."
bad,"not an enjoyable job for someone just starting out int he world. co-workers were not friendly at all, felt like high school, constant drama and shade being thrown by co workers"
bad,"The company is process driven, however no one follows the processes that are in place. Management says one thing, but does another. There are high expectations for work to be done, however it is left to your personal responsibility to get it done, and no one seems to know how to help."
bad,People are here for the money. They don't care about anything else. People want to work as little as possible and avoid . There's constant fear of getting demoted.
bad,"The company may be a great company, however employees are overworked and tired! Overtime is practically forced down your throat if you declined you are threatened with a write up. No one speaks up. You are told in the middle of the day that you are stuck until whatever time with no prior notice. If you decline a valid reason is needed. It would be up to management what valid is. But according to them enough prior notice is given. I don’t think 3 hours before your shift is due to end is enough notcie"
bad,"many people who worked here either left or went back to old jobs because they couldn't take the poor management. Many people, apparently, also developed anxiety from the quotas and micromanagement. You wouldn't think a call center would be so stressful, but I know plenty of people who had to get out or currently want out. While there were definitely good things about the working for the company, such as the benefits and being in a union, the overall morale of this place is quite low."
bad,Great job and great company. Training for incoming supervisors is terrible. I received 1 day of training and then was left on my own. was not given all the proper information about what is required of me as well as all the rules and regulations. the only time I heard from my management was when there was a problem.
bad,Many are doing the jobs of 2-3 people with very little recognition.  Manager played on their ipad on fb for a majority of the day when not in meetings they created.  There is definitely favoritism and some work none stop all day while others walk around socializing and get credit for everything.  Very old school procedures.
bad,Union doesn’t fight for you well but you are on probation for a year you can’t miss at all. They don’t work with you when it comes to emergency. You are expected to be at work they tell you to work.
bad,"The company may be a great company, however employees are overworked and tired! Overtime is practically forced down your throat if you declined you are threatened with a write up.

bad,good company but pushes you to work long hrs no value to consultants.No work family life balance.Not suggested for working mothers to opt this company
bad,"If you are looking to kick off your IT career and if fortunate enough to be selected, then PSEG is good place. But after a while you will hit a brick wall, alias IT Management. Their ""lack of knowledge"" in latest technologies and common practices can be astonishing.  Project management can be almost comical sometimes. I simply did not fit in."
bad,"The company has great core values and was built on loyalty and tradition. Unfortunately, the culture has changed and if you do not go along with the human resource management, you wll be penalized."
bad,"keep in the game socially or you lose-speak up is not acceptable.  Dont trust any one.  Big company-good benefits, good holidays, def encourage volunteering especially on days off"
bad,"Manager did not keep a good line of communication with employees, held no accountability.  Upward mobility was nonexistent, nepotism was very clear and good ole boys club."
good,PSEGLI downsized security bcuz management believe security was being paid to much and they hired security company and paid them $12 an hour . They continuously changed officers schedule.
good,"My days on the construction site always vary. I never know when I'm leaving for the day. I never know if its going to be a ""normal"" eight hour day or an eighteen hour day. I typically work between 60-90 hours a week. Seven days a week. I've learned to perfect communication skills in the work place. My co-workers are often different crew members. I bounce around quite often. Hardest part of my job is balancing a life. A life I don't have, too many hours and not enough time left in the day to do much. All for a bigger and better goal. Moving to Los Angeles. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with my crew members. I'm a very social person so if I can make their day a bit better with a laugh or some encouragement then I'm a happy man. The most enjoyable part of my job is ensuring the fact that my men work safely and follow OSHA regulations and above all, go home to their families at the end of the day."
good,"PSEG offers employees a decent pay. However, trying to advance in the company is relatively hard and political. Managers are in positions for more than 20 plus years with no vision or desire to advance themselves, you or improve operations. There are no technology improvements and IT department does not help with requests. Running on an basic SAP system that is 25 years old."
good,Be careful who you work for. I worked for a young woman director and she was clueless. She had never actually done any of the work she was a director of. That fits their philosophy that the management does not need to know or understand what they manage.
good,"Most days there are many things happening all at once, and the phrase ""Quantity over quality"" seems to be the norm. Most people who work here are very kind and helpful, but management (middle to upper C-level) refuse to hear concerns and ease modern working pains. They tend to turn blind eyes and ears to new ways of thinking, but are concerned about safety and diversity in the work place. "
good,"The company allows individuals the opportunity to learn and grow in different areas. The company is a champion for diversity and inclusion."
good,My manager was not willing to try to drive a re balancing of responsibilities despite a year of requests. An open position was left open for over a year with no end in sight
good,"The Accounts Payable Department is being out-sourced to India. There is not help or assistance to the employees who are losing their jobs. The company spends millions of dollars a year on charitable contributions, football tickets, sky boxes at sports venues. But eliminates jobs for the less expensive labor over seas."
good,Company is very safety driven. So large that you are just a number. Not understanding of personal issues. Company does not care about you personally. Come to work and perform or go home.
good,"This company is all about trying to get away with hiring your white male friends and giving preference to men while pretending the women aren't qualified.  They do too much hiring from outside and include the same people over and over again on project teams.  "
good,"A typical day involves both planned and unplanned acitvities."
good,Very hard to advance unless you know someone. You need to constantly promote your own work otherwise managers don't notice. They take new ideas for granted.
good,"PSEG was a good place to work, It has given me an opportunity to learn all aspect of the business. In the past few years the organization has been changing into a very challenging work atmosphere. There is very little work home balance, some manager expectations are unrealistic and unsustainable leading to employee burnout."
good,Supporting two distinct organizations always being pulled in different directions.  Often flavor of the day approaches to management.  Rotational senior level management program had staff jumping through new hoops constantly with significant loss of productivity at times.
good,I don’t really get the full experience of working for PSEG because I work in the kitchen only. I have gotten the opportunity to speak to a lot of workers who are actually in the company doing different jobs and I will say most employees seem happy and content with their jobs and pay.
good,Working at PSEG long island is sometimes great and sometimes not. some days everything goes smoothly and others its a mess. departments mostly stick to them selves and don't help each other out within the company.
good,bossy peeps  bossy peeps watch u like a hawk no breaks super safety everything safe this safe that might as well wear a complete safety suit all day. craps
good,Be prepared for performing storm duty. You must learn things on your own and don't expect much from your manager. Things often change or can't be economically justified.
good,"PSEG give me the opportunity to display my ability to manage multiple complex priorities. My responsibilities included administrating and verifying the administration of training requirements for qualifying and requalifying over 200 workers at 3 different power plants; while developing training matrices to display and assess their status; while preparing Quarterly Training Meetings for each power plant – Agenda, Material, and Minutes, as well as identifying and verifying completion of identified action items, which were selected based on priority and need; while developing the Control Room Operator Qualification Training Program; while delivering Just-In-Time Training as needed."
good,"This is  great job to increase skills but due to the transfer still a little unorganized.  great co workers always willing to help.  the downside is you really don't get any benefits unless you are in union.  As a  temp i'm not allotted any sick or vacation days, no paid holidays and taking a day off is a risk to my job security. As well as no health benefits. Yet overall a great opportunity!"
good,"12-hr rotating shift work"
good,The work is standard for Nuclear facilities. There is a lot of paper work that needs to be completed and due to the location the moral can get a little low.
good,"Each day is a challenge. Supervisors are expected to find ways to accomplish the same or more work with fewer resources. "
good,"Lots of reach back to Newark offices and directors.  Feeling of working towards a common goal -- keeping the lights on!  Most employees were inherited from union 1049 and National Grid. For the most part, folks work well together and have embraced the new environment provided."
good,It is a hierarchal company with many levels of leadership.  It taught me alot and strengthened my analytical skills and interpersonal skills.  The hardest part of the job was walking 10 miles to the plant everyday.
good,"Enjoyed working there because of the people and the opportunity to learn, and come to terms with, different perspectives on the role of Information Technology in the business operation.   Contributed to a more diverse set of projects than I had previously experienced and learned a tremendous amount about the energy industry."
good,"Professional company. Like any other company. Worked in Information Technology. Work with usual IT teams - Dev, BA, QA. Have to be familiar with usual software tools."
good,"As an energy company, PSEG has a captive customer and a unchanging produce to deliver.  This has led the company to focus on safety and consistency instead of innovation and growth.  The employees at PSEG tend to be long-tenured.  There is a ""command and control"" leadership style at the company. Business units work within silos and there is low collaboration between teams.  Women and people of color tend to leave the company at disproportionate rates than others at the company.  This is also true for people how are at the company for five years or less.  Most of the retention issues stem from a toxic culture that doesn't value new ideas and diversity of thought."
good,great people to work with company pays well. Looking for younger set of people to run business. Applying and interview time is too long. Overall enjoyed time here until my job was eliminated.
good,"Good job for a young person to get into an industry that needs new , young people to do the hard but rewarding work of the electric lineman. Good pay and benefits if you can pass the 4 year apprenticeship."
good,"Answering Phones, E-mail Writing, CCTV Surveillance, Adding/ Removing Employee Access, Incident Report Writing, Creating Spread Sheets, Security Dispatch, Customer Service, Contacting Police, Alarm Monitoring, Running Access Activity Reports"
good,"I wasn't here very long, this was a transition.  There were employees that had longevity here.  It's an industry that is needed.  I don't have much to say about it, since I was there only for a very short period of time."
good,Job let me work independently; a lot of walking in all kinds of weather; good benefits and health plan; downsizing some departments
good,"A good day is when I have a productive day at work.  I complete all my duties for the day and also spend time with my coworkers and learn something new about them.  Diversity is very important and when there are more opinions, a smart decision can be made."
good,Many locations to be employed around the country. Advancement is good.
good,PSEG is a great place to start a career. It teaches you a lot in a short period of time. There are few choice or chance to advance in your career.
good,Same people doing the same work.  Never bringing in diverse ideas and groups to think out of the box for solving the problem.  Everyone focuses the problem and not identifying the solution.  Embrace the problems and build on an inclusive culture.
good,"Depends on what is happening there. Refueling outages can be quite quick and demanding. Normal work pace outside those activities can be quite slow. Tend to work rotating shift work and work around the clock, Nights and Days."
good,PSEG Long Island offers great benefits. It is a well established company that can provide someone with nice opportunities. The company as a whole though can be a little boring. Each department looks out for themselves and there seems to be little collaboration between departments.
good,A typical day was at a decent pace and there was always things to do. I learned more about how to navigate through the corporate structure. the culture was balanced. there really wasn't anything part of the job. Most enjoyable was the team.
good,"long hours, night work is difficult. Micromanagement is an everyday occurrence. testing is way too much that does not need to be that much. good pay and alright benefits."
good,Not a bad place to work however job security is not good. The folks that work their are not bad but many in my department had a negative attitude. Overall not a bad company to work for.
good,"Overall, a good place to work. Enjoy the people I work with and for, they have good benefits, wish there was more time off, other than that, love being here."
good,"every day was new and different. not knowing whats around the corner you were always ready for something to occur. the crew was great and very supportive, real team effort."
good,"Most people start out as contractors, so the pay in the beginning is very modest (hourly) and there are essentially no benefits. Once you're full time there is room for growth."
good,"Great company, well run and organized.  Team bonding as well establishing a positive environment is important to them.  There are many opportunities to grow within this company."
good,PSEG is a good place to work. The company has room to advance and a solid mission statement. There is a focus on customer service and social responsibility.
good,PSEG tries very hard to stay current with working trends and technology sometimes to detriment of itself and staff. During my time they had a difficult time retaining young talent.
good,"You can make a lot of money here. Pay is good but you also live in a high cost of living area as well."
good,ok to work for they are very professional but they favor more people with experience rather than people that want to learn to get ahead in the company
good,The Company provide a good job Work/Life balance.  Great company to work for.
good,"if your into technology then a nuclear plant is the place for you. the pay and beneifts were great. the management were cool at times and a tough at others. if i could go back of found a different site to work at closer to me, i'd go."
good,"Overall I would have to say that the company has been enjoyable to work for.  However, working in the IT department does have its drawbacks.  There are many times where we work 7 days a week for months on end."
good,Its a good company to work for. All Agile projects . They spend money on employees.They provide training wherever required. Good work - life balance. Overall good place.
good,"Start out with the morning roll out and any safety topics. Go over the days schedule with the technicians and assign them their work. Perform pre-job and post job briefs. Resolve any issues that may come up. Emergent or unplanned work that is thrown into the schedule. Working with the techs is the enjoyable part of the job."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my day is doing the actual job; facilitating, organizing and expediting the work... Writing switching orders, working the field personnel, and clearing and operating the system.  I enjoy my job.  Quality of life, especially costs, on Long Island is what is forcing my family to look elsewhere to live."
good,Opportunities for growth over the years and exciting time to be in the utility sector.  Looking forward to increased role of distributed generation and electric vehicles.
good,"Facility is failing due to low LMP prices. Letting off a lot of staff. May sell-off. Low morale. Great people, most want out. 0600 to 1800 is a typical day. Management is frustrated by the lack of Corporate support. Meetings covered over 6 hours each day. My calendar was booked. "
good,"Overall one of the best companies ive worked for. The management can be a lot better depending on which department your in, the people can be difficult to work with mostly very clicky. The benefits are good. Although they offer tuition reimbursement it is very hard to do while working with most positions. If your looking for a great job and dont intend to do anything else or get into corporate  it will be good for u, but it is a place with a lot of politics and w and favoritism. orgohigher up"
good,We worked along side Nuclear Professionals who were trained in the trade to complete the work that was required to do. I learned what different tools were and how the tools were suppose to be used. I also learned alittle bit about each trade. The hardest part of the job was remembering which tools were which and what they were used for. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people who I was able to work with.

good,"Station was a challenge giving the opportunity to excel to the desired level.  Station had a strong work culture with Strong team prevalence,"
good,Work is always available but at time on short notice lots of traveling is required. At times don't know how long that you will be working for that day.
good,"Having worked there for 33 years I have seen many changes in both the company and the workers.  Its a dangerous job But a rewarding one.  You will get trained, retrained and trained once again.  Its a very fun place to work if you have a good work ethic"
good,"Pretty routinized with varying information received that must be reviewed, interpreted and journaled to the General Ledger.  Very busy environment and multitasking a must.  Got a very thorough experience closing the books of record for the month and developing IT skills.  Most individuals are great to work with, few issues with some of management that are beyond my control. Successfully closing the books even without adequate support system, has made me a stronger accountant."
good,Good company to work for. Top heavy company that needs to review itself.  Still good company with many perks. Benefits are ok but overtime has gotta less and less
good,"It was a pleasure working with the IT department of PSEG"
good,"I had no problem with the co-worker or management their system is a bit archaic but the pass or fail to test to hire seems almost a waste of time. "
good,Largely positive environment with team members working collaboratively.  People are treated equitably and most employees have invested a substantial amount of time in the company.  Alot of contractors in the company which could impact accountability.
good,it was ok for a while but the policies kept changing. alot of grey area that left the technicians liable for other peoples mistakes . pay is good but it was stressful
good,"Great benefits, Salary and Colleagues"
good,This is my first job out of school. The team is very small but we worked closely and have become very good friends. The company has good benefit but people working there is older on average.
good,Overall the company is a good organization to work for and takes care of their people for the most part. The management staff continuously changes making it difficult to learn expectations.
good,"Many great people willing to teach and mentor.  "
good,"Good company to work for.  High paced, high demand work environment, but if you are up to the challenge, PSEG is a very rewarding company to work for."
good,"•	Having  8+ years of experience in providing viable business solutions using SAP Business Objects Suite BI 4.0/3.1 XI/R2/6.5,5.1.7, IDT, Designer, WEBI, Info view, DESKI, Import Wizard, Upgrade Management Tool, Report Conversion Tool, Publishing Wizard, Crystal Reports, BO Explorer and Visualizations tools Xcelsius and Tableau."

good,"I have a nice working experience with PSEG."
good,I was only here for the summer but it was a fantastic internship and a great learning opportunity.
good,"Most of the people that I engaged with back when i worked there were friendly and helpful  It was at one time a fun and productive place to work, however that all changed with time.  Most of my supervisors were the best to work for.  It was a great experience to work with other departments during the outages as those I worked for and with taught me many interesting information about the plants."
good,"Good place to work. They are trying to stay afloat in this economic times, which means they are forced to eliminate positions."
good,"Where I worked for PSEG, it was dirty, hot, and most of the workers were rude and obnoxious. I guess that's part of the whole power plant atmosphere, but I didn't particularly enjoy it."
good,"Culture is good just upper management has people who have never set foot in the field of electric or gas. Job can be stressful overall but, all in all a good company to work for."
good,Veey demanding job. Alot of mandatory overtime. Call center 24/7. Job has great pay and great benefits. Lots of room for advancement if you play your card right.
good,"I liked the environment. The company has great opportunities, resources, and educational courses. The environment is great but I think it still lacks more of a team atmosphere and not so divided."
good,"i did enjoy working for PSEG and regret leaving, but with management changes and environmental requirements the jobs future wasnt looking very good..."
good,PSEG was great about allowing employee to improve their skills (technical training) and education (advanced education and certification) to support their career growth.
good,Good and Nice place to work. The co-workers are very friendly. Also includes some travel time to different locations which helps in some relaxation and visiting different locations.
good,Great job to work for . I love working in the flied and interacting with people. The workplace is very friendly. Its more like a family. Almost ten years working here an its still very enjoyable
good,"Great place and people to work with, wish I was a full time employee and not a contract employee. A typical day at the office was a enjoyable day, the most enjoyable part is when you accomplished everything that were given to get done"
good,"PSEG is a very proactive company, excellent place to work "
good,Strong executive leadership that cares for the employees. Company has a strong commitment to the environment and the communities it serves.
good,PSEG is the best management client they take care about their employers as well as consultants and very much cooperative.
good,"Fast paced environment and corporate culture. Excellent opportunities for learning and advancement within all PSEG subsidiaries. Excellent benefits and vacation/time off. Excellent benefit/401k/pension/credit union, etc."
good,Union Jobs that follow the usual Seniority mantra. If you hang in there long enough it will be worth it. Lots of overtime offered in addition to a great health plan and pension.
good,"PSEG has alot of high expectations and many demands.  They compensate well for it though.  There are a ton of administrative duties in addition to your actual job function, which take up alot of extra time."
good,PSEG is a good company to work. I have worked with them for almost 10 years and have had raises with each project I have been called on. unfortunately I am a contractor and I am looking for a permanent position.
good,"Good company to work for as a career option for long term stability, not very exciting or fast moving though. I enjoyed working there as an intern, but was not interested in the line of work or the career path there"
good,"PSEG is a corporation of several companies, each with their own personality. Management encourages community service, career development, and diversity."
good,I enjoyed working at PSEG as a creative contractor. Participated in many design competitions -- a plus. No professional advancement opportunities at the time - 12 years ago.
good,"HR made mistakes when inputting my salary into payroll system."
good,"It was fun working at PSEG, there I get to learn new skills and every staff was willing and kind enough to teach junior employeesnew tech skill. They were overall supportive."

good,Days working here become relatively routine very quickly. its not necessarily a bad thing since you basically know what to expect everyday.
good,Things often change based on politics. Things move slowly. You must be willing to work hard and to show up when needed.There is not more to sya about this company.
good,Starting with work which is very high priority. Keep updating manager with the progress. Getting suggestions on improvement in the work involved. Management was very supportive and encouraged me to think on my own and pointing out mistakes wherever necessary. The most enjoyable part of the job was different tasks that I had to carry on that I had never done before.
good,I enjoyed working at PSE&G because it is a safety customer  satisfying position. I love the challenge of making a customers emergency repair in a efficient manner. The satisfaction of the smile and customer appreciation is overwhelming. You can go home  knowing you safely and effectively helped the customer and management.

good,Colleagues and management have a high level of professionalism.  Quiet work environment where everyone keeps their nose to the grindstone and pretty much works independently
good,Routine rounds and readings of the designated plant equipment.  Was able to learn power plant systems that are common in this field. Coworkers were very friendly and always willing to lend a hand to anyone that needed help. Management team were willing to offer any help and knowledge as requested.  The job is not too difficult once you learn the basics of a power plant.  The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to see the behind the scenes of how power is made.

good,"● Work/Life balance not really a priority"
good,"PSEG does provide room for growth but with cultural and organizational changes, sometimes the room for growth is minimal. "
good,as a safety specialist the days were 40 hours with overtime. Boring days but good pay for the work it is an outside job so the weather is rough sometimes but overall not a bad job
good,No real effort to provide Work-Life Balance so working there became a challenge as a single parent and dealing with required emergency response to storms.
good,"I handled the security checkpoint.  all request for vendors and visitors to come in had to be emailed to me within 48 hours, unless emergency so I could compile a list.

I have learned through this position just how the people of Northern Nj live and work hard to build for their families. Management  within the meter reading department is fully supportive and very helpful to me as an employee. The hardest part of this job is to walk around the various neighborhoods day after day despite any weather conditions. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting different people, and not having to be confined to a desk or a room for a full days pay."

I love what I do,however, the commute is to much for me and my family. I get home after 7:00 PM each night and its starting to take a told on my family and I.

good,"Never a dull day. Variety of duties. Days go by fast. Lots of excitement working as a first responder on gas leaks and carbon monoxide calls. Repair customer heating and air conditioning water heaters dryers ranges etc. Install gas meters, turn on and shutoff customer gas and electric services. Hardest parts during cold weather snaps and snowstorms you are out there in the mix putting in crazy overtime, but the paycheck eases the pain. Benefits bar none. A company you can grow with and retire. And the worst part is I was terminated  from this company I loved, if that does not say enough I don't know what will. I miss my Union Brothers and I miss my customers. Never will have a great job like this one in a million years. I would come from the other side of the world to work there again."

good,a typical day would be a non stop calls coming in  I learned a lot of different people who call in about their issues. management is not the same there its like boot camp the culture is a good place to work various people work there. the hardest part of the job is not to make any mistakes with the customers and be polite and the most enjoyable part is the different people u speak to on the phone and also who u work with

I was pleasantly surprised because the corporate atmosphere can sometimes take away from an experience but I still felt welcomed, valued, and respected as if I was a full-time employee. Through the internship (and due to the nature of my job title itself), I had the amazing opportunity to meet many different people as I traveled all over the island- I was also reimbursed for any extra travel expenses. I believe I left a good impression with lots of employees, whom have become excellent networking connections. "
