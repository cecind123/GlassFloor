rating,review
bad,Is a terrible company don't work there is no good for you. Supervisor is not a professional person and doesn't care about your hard work and the manager instigated.
bad,"Unfortunately, after over 20 years in the company i loved one manager left a very sour taste in my mouth by choosing to isolate, trap and discharge me ."
bad,"Management does not appear to respect employees from the beginning: many interviews, sometimes no communication afterward, no return phone calls after demanding time prior to hiring; the largest concern is sales and what the employee can do for the company rather than ensuring the company also fits into some of the employee's needs for better morale. It's hypocritical to ask that customer facing employees perform perfectly while hiring managers and branch managers have little to no people or communication skills, lack of etiquette, and lack of basic courtesy. Not everyone that applies to PNC carries a nothing more than a high school diploma and there are people in the workforce who would like to be treated with some form of dignity. If you live in Southern Maryland and you would like to be treated fairly and with respect, look and apply elsewhere. If you are simply looking for a paycheck and a learning stepping stone but do not care so much about how you are treated, go for it."
bad,"Honestly an awful place to work, it’s extremely stressful and know one helps you. Managers don’t care, and it’s very hard. You can’t take a bathroom break without getting yelled at."
bad,"Its becoming a product pushing company. Employees are under paid, unhappy which has a high turnover rate. Customer are affected by it and they will express their concerns through customer surveys which employees get an incentive on the overall branch performance, not individually. The goal is to reach out to others branches for help but they are barley staffed themselves. Upper management doesn't care about employees career path all they want to make sure you are getting Credit Card applications on a daily basis and investment referrals.It is all about what PNC can get. PNC make it seem better than what it is. If that was the case why are the branches not fully staffed with employees. Actions should line up with their words."
bad,The people in this position are horrible.. They tell you are able to ask questions if you need help and then when you do you are told by the manager that the people dont know your job because they are separate divisions within this job. The manager and team lead are just wishy washy and backstabbing people!
bad,Exempt employees are expected to work 50-60+ hours per week because hourly employees cannot.  Senior management at Brecksville/Pittsburgh Lending facility is inexperienced and/or unconcerned with customers or employees.
bad,Had a customer call and threaten to shot every single person in the head and kill them.  PNC bank did nothing.  Customer continues to call and come into the bank and harass  us.  Pnc didnt care at all about anyone's safety.
bad,"They expect you to push products on everyone even those who clearly don’t need it. I was put on warning for not offering to a 86yr old customer. Pay is not good when you think about what you bring home monthly. Management pushes everything on the team and still expects you to finish your work. Let me not start on the racist, sexist policy. Go anywhere else you’ll be so much better off."
bad,They don't know how to treat an employee.  They offten treat you like you  are nobody.  They are full of promises that they are not going to fullfill.  Don't work with them EVER!!! Manager don't know anything and then treat you like a dum person.  Shame on them.
bad,I just feel that PNC set to high of professional standards for such a low rate of pay. This job wasn’t a good fit for me. Very strict guidelines cookie cutter things I didn’t like.
bad,don't believe the lies - only protect their own - will make an example out of you - only selling you a dream - Racist - prefer hiring their own - only help their own - only promote their own
bad,"PNC is a company that even though they said they like to promote from within the company, they don't really like to have employees asking for promotions. I saw plenty of times and when it was my turn as expected i was decline as well."
bad,"This used to be a great company, up until consumer merged with mortgage and screwed up the entire system. Cut bonuses, fired management, put in incompetent management, no room for growth. This place is going downhill. If I could give zero stars I would. Worst place to work."
bad,"Management was asking staffs to break written guidelines.  Also upper management had their favorite managers and treated them differently than other managers.    The goals and expecations are unattainable, typically over 55% of the branches don't obtain their goals."
bad,"The location I was at made the entire corporation look bad when it comes to equality on race. The location I was placed at needs to be reviewed and monitored, not to mention shut down completely."
bad,Co workers are awesome management sucks I don't recommend anyone to go there .no raise in 2 years they want you to work 6 days a week  with no extra be.
bad,"Worked 3 years at this company.  Was a great employee, dependable, made sales goals but never received one raise.  We had an employee who caused problems with everyone but nothing was ever done about her in spite of numerous complaints.  DO NOT WORK HERE!!!!!"
bad,"no work life balance. "
bad,I would rather beg on a street corner then work for PNC they are the biggest back stabbing lying underhanded place. They allow bullies. The talk about employees when they are not around. They threat you.
bad,Stressfulenvironmnet with little or no feedback on job performance but incrediby high expectationsor performance.  Superiosrs demanding but give no guidance.
bad,"Interviewed with the recruiting department and it was the most humiliating experience I have ever had. Once I arrived, I was surprised to see that I had a group interview. The questions asked had no relation to the actual job and I wasted an entire day answering questions such as, ""what do you like to do on the weekend?"""
bad,"It would take me writing an op-ed or a book. In short, don't work here; there are many better alternatives and believe me you deserve better. Turnover and burnout accepted as the norm by upper management. Consistently understaffed and short resources. There is a reason big banks have the reputation they do. This place takes the cake for hypocrisy because public facing marketing tells one story but once you get in, it's the complete opposite. 100% turnover is commonplace. Don't believe me? Walk into any branch in the Atlanta Metro Region and survey how long people have worked there outside of management. Ask what turn over is like in general and if it's common to have turnover. Ask if the branch is fully staffed and how long it has been that way. There were branches that could not even open the doors on a consistent basis without redirecting employees from their regular home branch to cover others because of being short staffed. Too much to list but take my word for it, pass this one by for both employment and banking needs."
bad,"Conventional underwriters are discriminated against. Underwriter Managers will not defend or speak up for employees, bottom line they are a waste.  If you are a conventional underwriter do not work here you will be discriminated against."
bad,I was disrespected by the loan officer...she gaslighted me...she was the worst person I’ve ever worked for. She didn’t train me well at all and didn’t give me a chance.
bad,I had to take some sick time off but because my branch manager loved to run his mouth and tell everyone business my leave was denied.. had to argue for days to get my final pay. Employee relations was rude and took the side of the branch manager. Not professional environment I would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,"I served as a customer care professional assisting customer with their checking, savings and online banking assistance.  Responsible for providing excellent customer services and maintaining and resolving customer's issues"
bad,"Micromanagement badly, my manager was so stress out that she couldn’t do her job so she was in so many phone calls that she need to delegate, we have so unnecessary dally phone calls, working there is the worst and the regional manager in Florida the worst.  "
bad,"I was sexually harassed and cursed out by customers when I brought it to their attention I was told ""just don't wait on those clients."" I worked hard coming in when the street were paved with ice. The new Regional manger was terrible,she would look me up and down. She clearly didn't care for me."
bad,with a position as such and the demand to service the branches a guaranteed salary needs to be given.  the new system for LOS was not user friendly and the training was minimal.
bad,"I have worked in the mortgage industry for 20 years. And this was the worst experience of my entire career. PNC is unethical  and lack any sense of moral compass. "
bad,"ABSOLUTELY the worst management. If you want to be dehumanized, disrespected , dishonored, overworked, underpaid and set up for FAILURE, please work here."
bad,"one of the worst if not THE worst places I have ever worked in my life. The ""management"" was a joke. I was told, in front of my fellow co-workers and customers that I was "" a liar, couldn't do anything right, couldn't admit to wrong doings"" etc. I was ""excused"" when confronting this ""management"" about my issues with how I was being treated and I actually took the first job that came my way with a severe pay cut because I could not take it anymore. I almost walked out twice and I have never walked out of a job in my life. This company is a joke. I tell customers and future employers to run don't walk away from this place. no good will come from your time here."
bad,"The person conducting interview to work for this company from home was extremely rude and disrespectful. It was the first contact live I had with this company and it was over the phone. The first person you talk to in every company is like the letter of presentation of that company , it is like the welcome to that place, but if the ""welcome"" is a really bad one, the first impression is ""you are not welcome here"", so who would like to work at company like that? No one , right ? I think nobody deserves such mistreatment. I believe on being nice with people, not rude like her. And on top of that I received an email saying that I wasn't hired. So , I not only wasted my time but I had to go through such an awkward situation because I never experienced nothing like this before in any of the  of companies I applied for."
bad,If you are a loan officer stay away from PNC. They are a total mess on all fazes of the loan process and nobody who makes a salary gives a dam about LO's. No support at all from management.
bad,Some location * will leave unknown*  but in Georgia is like working in Wayward Pines (look it up) Too much is left in the gray area as managers discretion. There were times we worked through the entire day with no lunch. Ive worked numerous times by myself as a teller which is definitely a security risk.
bad,folks were not very pleasant to be around and not helpful at all. Not somewhere I would recommend anyone to work. They micromanage all their employees from bottom to top.
bad,"Promotions are not available because the managers that are there, stay- they've not moved on in 18 years, which means there is no way for you to move up because they've not moved out."
bad,"I would not recommend my worse enemy to work here. Let me tell you if you work for a call center before and think this will be different because its a bank your wrong. Pnc ask for some high standards from there employee's but the walk in the door salary is a joke. You will slave out and maybe see $33,000 after your first 2 years if your lucky. They dont care about you as a employee just there customers, they grade your calls on 3 calls month with calls being being the best.  Now let me tell every set rep has there own way of scoring calls even know they have a guide they have to go by. They all hear calls differently so good luck with that. Also the adherence standard for my dept was 94% with half hour lunches.  so if you want a job with low pay short lunches and customer yelling at you because pnc is a horrible bank. You are given 6 mins to resolve these issues and god forbid you need help.. smh dont work here"
bad,"Have been working here for a while now and they are not wiling to work with my hours to attend school because my branch is ""short staffed"".  It would be amazing if they would be a bit more flexible even if you are a full-time employee"
bad,"A typical day at work you sign in, start taking clients, balance and close at the end of the day. I learned to have a lot of patience when dealing with rude and overbearing people. I also learned that the team that works here is definitely flawed and I wished I had taken my learning experience at a different branch/bank. Management was not good at all, and careless. The culture of the workplace just not good either, the hardest part of the job, everything it was stressful, and most enjoyed getting to go home."
bad,The environment at this bank did not foster teamwork or support by management.  Your personal success was viewed as a threat to management.  The pay was poor.
bad,"the environment is very segregated. Leadership does not have a value system the support success. Poor moral , no integrity , no support , no training , more work given even when already at full capacity"
bad,My experience working for PNC was not the best. The management is allowed to retaliate against the workers if they take disputes to upper management. They are falsely accused of transgressions that in turn get them fired. There is no viable coaching or training when something is done wrong. Leaders were leaving the department based on how poorly other managers were acting. All in all it was not a; good place to work.
bad,"So when I worked for them in the begining it seemed ok but for your training they send you far and the travel is a nightmare then policy and procedure seemed to change daily so forget what you learned cause it will change without notice which makes you look stupid helping the customers. They say they want to do whats right for the client when the sales goals are pushed on them so much that you are then forced to do whats not right for them just to get them off your back and to still have a job. Turn over was so high and management has favorites that when they continuously do bad they keep letting it happen. Don't expect a raise ever if your surveys aren't a perfect 5 and you must meet your ridiculous sales goals as well. No room to advance and running around for nothing and dont believe banker hours when you hear it, no such thing. Long hours and then the BM would keep you after hours and also expect you to do events and reach out as well so no work life balance whatsoever. I say keep looking and don't bother with this unprofessional place just keep clear of this place."
bad,The management teams were very mean and rude to employees. They did not follow the hand book as they were supposed to. They had more time to take pictures of employees outfits than to manage the pipelines for the employees.
bad,"There are some things that are positive, like the maternity leave. You can literally take off 4 months to have a baby. The problem is after you have that baby, any time you may need is dependent on your manager/department. There are not set rules or policies as far as how to take OA time, leaving early,vacation days, etc. So, if you have to leave an hour early to take that new baby to the doctor, you better dam well have OA time or you are S.O.L. And don't even think about having a disabled child, because when those last minute things pop up, as they absolutely will, you either need to take OT time or FMLA that you won't get paid for. Even if your department has over time on a weekly basis, there is no making up unless it's ""scheduled"". Unless that is your are one of the special employees whose rules don't pertain to you; then you're ok. Also, they won't train you for you're position and if you make a mistake, they then want to write you up and threaten your job. You can ask just about any employee at PNC and they will tell you the training is deplorable. Throughout the entire company. Plus, don't think you'll be able to move around based on the merit of your work, work ethic, performance because it's all about who you know. If you don't know someone in a department, you more than likely won't even get a shot, especially if it's a supervisor position. They have to interview people for legal reasons, but what you don't know is they already have someone in mind for that position, so they are just wasting your time. I have a literally been turned down for a job the hiring manager"
bad,"Was lured here and found management to be extremely unprofessional and biased towards certain people.  Place is a sweat shop - burn 'em and churn 'em is what they do.  No room for advancement - had the carrot dangled with regards to the yearly bonus - never received it.  "
bad,"PNC doesn't retain employees because of the staffing,  training,  and the no exceptions for mistakes.   After PNC terminated me, I have had nothing but issues with my termination. They put the wrong month and date which caused my health benefits to be put on hold until they corrected it as well as my pay and vacation pay.  I left PNC on September 19th and they had entered August 20th. As of Tuesday October 10th I was supposed to have everything corrected and have my paper work overnighted didn't receive it until October 12th after calling and asking where it was.  I have had to call HR, ERIC, HEALTH/ 401 K department at least once if not twice a week to follow up what they were doing to fix this.  Not a place I would recommend or ever go back to work for and plan on pulling all my accounts and going to a different bank."
bad,"They were not flexible in an emergency.  Too many people there like to stir the pot and create a hostile environment.  I will never and would never recommend anyone to EVER work there.  They work you to death and pay you horribly.  Management was worthless as well.  Any conversation you had privately with the manager, never stayed quite because that person always went and talked about it with everyone else.  Horrible, horrible, horrible plavce to work."
bad,Management is horrible. Always short staffed and long hours. They don't care about the employees expect for making sure that there is no line. No work life balance at all.
bad,"bad company to work for. Poor Management. Micro manage employees. poor technology. too focused on numbers, and promote people without merit. Very bad experience."
bad,"In the Dallas contractor office in Plano, They cancelled the contract and fired over 20 PMs for something that 3 developers did on their laptops, very unfair!"
bad,Very stressful work environment never feel settled in but if you happened to make to a year if youve done everything they demand you do get an opportunity to move to better hours or different departments
bad,"I was there for 16 years and when I left people who were just hired was making what I was making,. The lack of life balance, Why work mandatory every other weekend, Just plan selfish"
bad,"Management was not very forthcoming in eliminating my position. No warnings at all for a person near retirement age? Where is the compassion and consideration? Gave everything I had and begged for more work, only to be shown the door."
bad,god. they still use mainframes. and case insensitive passwords. i guess if they didnt get money from the federal reserve this would be an unsustainable business model.
bad,PNC is not a company I would recommend anyone to apply to in the Loss Mitigation department.  Management did not have the tools to effectively manage us.
bad,Worked there a long time ago.  Processed banking transactions. The people were nice and I has no issues.  Left because it was a part time job.  Wanted more hours
bad,"PNC does not like to promote from within, they would rather hire from the outside and lay off the current employees.  This is not a career type of bank."
bad,Even though I spent 6 years working for this company I would not recommend anyone working for PNC.  My last annual raise was .05 cents.  The turn over rate on branch managers was horrible.
bad,I was misled about this position and the people currently doing this job are not being led by effective management. They are free to do what they want and their results are self reported.
bad,"After being an analyst for several years elsewhere, I made the sad mistake of going to PNC.  This was now for me several years ago and I am still scarred by the experience."
bad,"This location was all fun and games, did not take there work seriously which made my position hard as I was looking for a career and not a job.  I thought PNC Bank was a successful company and hired people that wanted to be successful as well."
bad,If you are part of the clique - you are golden.  Don't come in here trying to be an individual. PNC is all about metrics but does little to nothing with anything it encounters that does not go along with the current storyline.
bad,"It's impossible to move up, the pay does not cover cost of living, and they don't really care about you at all. Every day is the same and very boring. If you're boring, this company is for you. If you're willing to just settle for a comfortable job because ""at least you'll have a job,"" this company is for you, if you're looking to be broke and not take nice vacations, get a job here. If you like to struggle to save money, get a job here. If you want terrible health insurance and love medical bills, PNC is just for you."
bad,Like transferring to their data to new computers. Make sure they all their data and able to login have access all their application. Great people to work with
bad,"People would belittle others, the rules were different for each person in the departments, and there was zero consistency. Not a happy, healthy, or fun place to work at all."
bad,"The hours are terrible.  Working holidays, Sundays, nights and harassing people in food stores.  You're expected to silicate people in the cereal isle.  Working in a bank on Thanksgiving day is not ok by me"
bad,"The management was horrible, talking about other employees to other employees.  Always causing a hostile work environment and competition between employees."
bad,I hated my job there and never wish I would have taken it. false promises and too much entitlement and title abusiveness for my liking. to assistance in helping with management and constantly would contradict themselves. 
bad,I do not want to give a review of this company due to personal circumstances that occurred while I was employed there.  It was an environment of helping certain individuals achieve their goals while neglecting others.
bad,"long story short, the company wants the workers to make gold from straw.  they find reasons to talk down to the employee and refuse to listen when they make a bad decision."
bad,"Management only cared about making their superiors happy. We employees got more work and they laid off people to cut costs. We were always short on paper clips and pens, but PNC could afford the PR to name a baseball stadium after them."
bad,"Working for PNC feelt like a punishment. They expect a lot for very little pay. Branches are run on fumes and they expected you to deliver great service and sell. Management was ineffective beyond words, too busy creating endless action plans...The rot definitely set in from the top. People were fleeing in droves. The new recruits had zero bank experience and nobody had time to train them so loads of errors and bad scores which torpedoed any bonuses. All around bad. The culture is toxic."
bad,Started to copy Wells Fargo in aggressiveness of sales and increasing goals. Stressful environment and long work hours. Enjoyable working experience at local lever and learned a lot from my time there.
bad,this was a horrible place to work. No one trusted anyone and yu are expected to be there even when you are not feeling well.  Don't become friends with anyone you work with because you will get stabbed in the back
bad,PNC starts your career with a mask on but eventually you come to realize that they are all about the dollar and not the customer nor employee. The even sadder things though is when your manager no longer wants you around they concoct accusations that are so ridiculous just to make sure you are terminated.
bad,Current regional manager and asst are horrible. Made exceptions for the people they were hanging out with On weekendsFound any reason to fire anybody.
bad,"Very cut-throat company that did not pay well. The employees were not happy and the management was very poor.  Very little room for advancement unless you were female and/or black. Micromanagement was everywhere, and the supervisors and management did not even know very well their departments function(s) they depended too much on the staff to handle all the work and know the answers to questions they should have already known.  Nobody worked well together and if they chose to fire a person they just did it on the spot and not try to work out any differences.  Just bad all around company to work for.  Nothing to offer as an incentive to stay."
bad,I'd never recommend any position there. Management is very stressed and they will pass that stress on to you. They wanted to increase employee benefits to encourage people to stay but a lot of people from my branch left for other banks in the short period of time that I was there.
bad,"If you want to see favoritism on daily basis, constant lying from management, and talked to like you are 3 years old that please join PNC bank.  Or if you are Polish"
bad,"If you like to see less talented people coming in from outside the company get paid more than you, sign up!  They'll pile work on and give you a 1% raise saying there's no money in the budget while the company is making 1 billion a quarter."
bad,Very Unprofessional and health care is bad. I wouldn’t recommend anyone to work there. Bad overall it will stress you out to work there. I can’t stress enough that all personal there needs hr training.
bad,Pnc is a good company -for benefits pay is not idea but work environment changes based on branch -higher up is   not informed on what is going on with branch
bad,"Currently work here as an application developer.  They simply do not respect your time of home life.  They will work you all kinds of crazy hours.  I have worked many 20 hour days.  Management does not follow PNC's rules and guidelines.  They're pretty much given free reign and aren't govern or checked, so basically, you're at the mercy of your manager whether you perform well or not.  Minorities have a harder time getting management positions.  They are overworking their skilled employees and underworking the people right out of college with no skills.  Very bizarre work environment."
bad,I never recommend anyone going to solution architecture group as very poor mgmt and lack of budget forecasting. Very volatile environment and no proper laying out projects or work load distribution
bad,Not the best environment very complicated for part-time employees to do other things besides work. If you are a student make sure to be flexible as they will not be.
bad,"I worked for pnc for 3+ years and the environment is great, but the management is terrible, the expectations are high and unrealistic. The pay is terrible as well, and fun fact  pnc employees make the same amount as Aldi cashiers (how?). Oh and if you quit or get fired all paid vacation time has to be paid back. The turn over rate for pnc is the highest in Kalamazoo (another fun fact). So if you don’t mind having managers look over your shoulder and punish you for every little thing you do and if you’re willing to receive the same pay as a cashier for 10x the work than pnc is the place for you. I wouldn’t recommend wasting your time. It’s not worth the stress and headache."
bad,"Horrible work life balance, management wants to exceed goals on loans yet gets upset if you exceed 40 hours per work (which is required to accomplish goal) "
bad,Worst place to work. Stealing from customers by lying to them. Putting pressure on the employees. No work life balance. very stressful place to work at.
bad,A financial advisor with PNC is an impossible job. You drive around to branches trying to help people who really have no intention of investing. The referrals come because the branch personnel are pressured to make referrals.
bad,Not very impressed with managment or how they treat there employees. well over worked and not paid fairly. when reported to upper managment nothing gets done!
bad,"I literally had panic attacks every morning before I walked into work. They want you to SELL SELL SELL! It did not matter that there weren't any opportunities to sell a credit card, mortgage or etc. They practically harassed me every day about sales. I miss my customers SO MUCH that was the only perk of working there. The ""raise"" was an insult."
bad,One of the worse experiences in my life. Very toxic environment. Mentally and physically exhausted. Robbed four times. Only one raise during whole time there. Management didn't have your back at all.
bad,worst place to work stressful environment not worth the headache management is horrible nobody knows their job horrible training does not care about employees number driven
bad,"This job was so different then any other people they did have people that had there clicks, and told on other people so save there self on what ever they did bad did not like this job had to leave. they have people that help only the people they like and not new customers much at all, have to be in the click to get good service."
bad,Business banking was a joke could not get loans approved goals for community bankers were the same as metro bankers the lack of local knowledge was a tremendous handicap
bad,This bank does not promote from within. Departments are supposed to be managed similarly however some departments can approve OT without being monitored.   Many departments hire men over women with same work experience.
bad,"With the internship, it was meant to be a ten week interview on both sides and after spending my time there I did not enjoy being there. I never saw my boss, the work was almost non existent. I waited weeks for software and I had to figure out how to work for the company on my own. PNC has a lot of positive going for them but the experience I had there was unbelievably unproductive."
bad,"Horrible place to work. No respect, everyone's replaceable attitude. No advancement opportunities or promotions given. Not one team building activity in over 3 years."
bad,Very micro-management place. Little advance not much to choose from and a load of work from the moment you step in to the door until your finish. Not team work.
bad,"rude co workers, poor management, no parking, long hours only 1 day a week off, poor hr and response hr team, will never work there again, do not recommend"
bad,"Poor advancement opportunities, under appreciated, lack of managerial support, micro-managed, no sense of loyalty nor guidance, very negative environment"
bad,its the blind leading the blind- you are better off at any other bank.  they have the worst underwriting processes.  the goals are double what other banks are so only 10% actually hit bonus which is a joke
bad,Working for PNC was a very difficult place to work.  They have a PNC conversation which I felt was very intrusive for clients.  It was a canned conversation that they expected you to use with all clients.
bad,"Of all the banks that I have worked,PNC is by far the worst.My Manager was so incompetent that it affected  the performance of the branch.  This was the most stressful work environment that I ever worked in.."
bad,horrible place to work.I was part time for the 4 years i worked there. They were ok with working around my schedule due to me being a single mother with 3 kids but overall the company was not good to their employees. customer were treated better.
bad,"I did not receive the training I needed to independently perform my job duties. The assistant manager who was in charge would leave early most days with unfinished work for the new hires to complete , who did not have adequate training."
bad,Poor compensation. Getting promoted within the company means nothing because they are unwilling to give you any considerable increase no matter how well you perform.
bad,"They do not care about their employees! You can do 10 million things right but your first mistake will always be your last with the company. I was with the company for 15 years. Won rewards, trips etc left and right. They wanted to get rid of the long time employees to hire younger employees with cheaper salary."
bad,"Management don't assist their agents when they need assistance. Management are never around when you need help and lucky if they're at their desk and they will not help you, unless you are their favorite. "
bad,"No communication between upper and lower management, redesigned horrible payscale that limits any opportunity for advancement or raises, demotions, overworked."
bad,"I started with a small hometown bank that was bought out four times over the 21 years I worked there. When PNC come along, they tried EVERYTHING to cut my salary...said $29,000 was WAY over their pay scale for a Customer Service Rep!!! After many unsuccessful attempts, they called me & another lady that had been there for 14 years, into an office and said they were letting us go...but we would get a severance package. The day AFTER I found a new job, I was told by management that they now needed me....and when I said no, I was let go with NO SEVERANCE whatsoever!!!!  The only thing PNC cares about is making money, NOT about the customers!!!"
bad,"With the exception of the guy who initially managed me, the leadership in Greater Maryland is pathetic.  All former BofA managers who must've had helluva good resumes because it did not carry over to the position."
bad,"Clients are treated as if they are lucky to be clients, comes from the top down.  Complete arrogance and wouldn't have worked there, but loved the people I worked with, just not the management."
bad,"Terrible work/life balance, horrible management and bosses, years behind in technology and workplace applications for being a bank.  Stay away from this company for work and banking needs."
bad,rGood Company to start your career. Salary is good and some leader will help you move up the career ladder. you can leader a lot in a shorty time. the sky is the limit
bad,Started off great just that management lets their personal issues get in the way of running the branch properly. Can sometimes be unprofessional when dealing with hr and othet departments within pnc.
bad,"i was not treated like a human being, my manager was a cardboard cutout. it was a nightmare i was hired to fill some bizarre quota which was ever changing, no feedback on work until, hey you aren't meeting the goals, there's the door. Sure it's a good place to work for if you aren't on the low levels. they roll their poo downhill"
bad,"Lack of management. Do not encourage employees to seek improvement. Do not take into consideration your efforts. 100% punctuality, Did overtime whenever requested, but a mistake and you are fired!. Be careful!"
bad,"Management for PNC was very lacking. They didnt know how to do their own job and tried to teach you how to do your own. And if you messed up doing your own job, they didnt assist you to fix it they just used it as a way to fire you, instead of a teaching point."
bad,"Big Bank,high turnover equals Big profits, and a negative impact on the communities it serves/ruins. Commenting on this or any other company may be required, but is useless toward making them accountable.  They will continue on as ""business as usual"""
bad,I actually enjoyed this job.The work is demanding and requires alot of minute detail which I enjoyed. Having to sale credit cards and accounts isn't fun for me. Also under paid for the amount of work you do daily.
bad,I think that a few pnc's are great and wonderful to work at but others are awful huge turn over rate and never enough staff to work at the other branchs we were always going from one location to another. never a steady routine
bad,Where do I start.  Backstabbing people everywhere.  Its best to just keep your head down and do your work.  No such thing as loyalty.  Everyone is just looking our for themselves.   Horrible pay.
bad,"Management wants to tell you what you need to be doing, instead of helping out when you need it and there is a definite lack of leadership at my branch."
bad,"Horrible Company to work for, this bank is so disorganized and doesn't have the client's best interest at heart. Their polices are a joke and they don't offer adequate training for their new hires."
bad,Poor work life balance for managers of PNC Bank in the Northern MI area. Managers and employees are expected to produce high sales results in a low income area.
bad,"A lot of people started to leave once they changed their compensation plans. PNC Mortgage changes their compensation plans all to often, along with withdrawal requirement."
bad,Work and never recognized or acknowledged for your job done.  Stressed daily on whether or not you would have a job or if you were getting laid off.  They didn't care about the people in the eastern part.  This was not a good company to work for.
bad,"My manager was an imbecile who should not have even been able to get such a job.  She also showed very inappropriate pictures of herself in a bikini to everyone.  Then my assistant manager was just as bad.  He talked to me and one of the other tellers about deer mating rituals.  They were both very unethical, inappropriate, and incompetent.  When I got back from vacation I had found that they had but $80 of counterfeit 20s in the ATM and didn't even notice."
bad,An absolutely terrible experience with no work life balance and management that must not have been able to get a job anywhere else.  The ethics policy should be printed on toilet paper and hiring is a joke.
bad,The company had great diversity and decent pay but they treat their employees terrible. Management talked to the employees as if they were beneath them
bad,"Painted a colorful picture then never followed thru with training for promotion. management was horrible, Lots of politics, very unorganized made job difficult."
bad,"Top level management is very unprofessional."
bad,"They act like they are an understanding company but God forbid anything come up in your personal life. Such as illness, a child getting sick, or a family member in the hospital. They will fire you."
bad,"There is no work/life balance. Management's perspective is that you are dispensable, and bring no value. The work day is typically 9 hours, and you are expected to also work evenings from home and weekends. The range of duties is far outside of scope."
bad,The banking industry is convoluted with laws and policies and unfair charges to customer accounts based on types of accounts.  Customers were not happy with all technology being the majority of banking instead of the person to person face to face contact.  The hours were great but the customers not always happy with the branch's open times.
bad,"Poor management.  Job  eliminated  after  30 years  because business  needs  changed aka  ageism.  My direct manager never  allowed me to perform my job  because  he did  not like I was  not in Pittsburg.  In-house  recruiters  did  little to  find  me employment  elsewhere  in  company.   The  ""career counselor""  has provided little actual  help in  securing  employment.  My duties  running EEOC  reports.  Do  not  work for this  company/"
bad,Low pay. Hostile branch environment. Must meet sales goals or else your gone. Upper management does not care about you at all.
bad,"The regional manager, if he does not like you, you will be put in a position to quit or get fired!!!! They all have there favorites. No growth opportunities in this region."
bad,This place is a joke a cult driven nut house  they pass off work and play mind games. They mob you in interviews and intimidate you.
bad,"i started out truly enjoying the job, then all the ladies that i worked with at that branch quit, so the entire load was shifted to me, i was a part time 28 hour a week teller and they were working me 40-45 hours every week and i was doing everything behind the teller line with very little assist from any team mates. i asked them to transfer me to a branch that only needed a 28 hour a week part time teller but   because it is against PNC procedure and policy. after 3 months of no letup. i quit."
bad,PNC does not compensate employees well and is also stuck in an old culture style of managing. Senior Management does not like to listen to its more youthful minds who bring good ideas to improve the business.
bad,"The company is ran horrible. I've been a dedicated employer for almost 2 years and I use to be proud of this company now I cant wait to find another job. Management don't care if you develop or not the training sucks,  they don't pay enough but wants you to go above and beyond. They make it hard to earn your bonuses"
bad,It started out great. But after a month the interoffice politics and the adversarial atmosphere they created between the platform and the tellers was ridiculous. Some managers were not professional while the Branch manager was great for the most part. The pay did not make the situation any better for the amount of work they wanted done. Poor planning for new system roll outs and no training on how to handle the back lash. It was a mess. I was even faulted for working 40 hours as a part time employee even though the manager was responsible for scheduling and had asked me repeatedly to stay.
bad,Do not waste your time or efforts with this company. They could care less about you as an employee and expect you to sell sell sell!!! Its very hard to sell for a company that you feel so  horribly about! The management is very poor and I really don't understand how they ever got their positions
bad,"helping peers understand day to day tasks"
bad,"pay is bad, work is non stop. have to work 6days straight to get 36 hours. 3-4 hour shifts is a joke in my opinion. Managers are asking to always due more"
bad,"This was hands down the worst place I have ever worked at in my life. Employees were angry, unmotivated, complained constantly and were full of drama. The weasly manager was too busy with his thumbs up his rear to care. The work environment is full of hormonal women out to eat each other alive. No breaks were allowed, you had to always come in early and stay late, often were unable to leave for lunch, and deal with angry coworkers and customers. Severely understaffed, underpaid branch. AVOID."
bad,I was on contract for windows 7 upgrade. The manager in charge had no clue what was going on. He left a contract worker in charge. The main goal was to do minimum work to keep the contract going. I was never given my own credentials to log in to the bank machines. I had to log in with co workers credentials. It seemed like most of the team was faking to make it.
bad,Micromanaged. Seem to view their people more like numbers or sheep that are herdable and dispensable. Regularly understaffed at all levels. Co. feels bland and hostile. Don't recommend it to anyone.
bad,"They have a survey system in which you need to have a 4.8 to a 5 to be green. If you aren't corporate will not get off your back. You have very little control over what the customers say on these surveys; many times they aren't even rating you as an employee. They are rating the bank as a whole, or a different employee. Some people give all 4's because they don't believe anyone can be perfect and that everyone has room for improvement. It's a rolling score so all 4's will mess you up for the next year. There was a time when my co-worker got a 2.8 because a customer was convinced the upgrade that was done for him was the reason he subsequently had his identity stolen. I had another co-worker get a 2 because our branch wasn't handicap accessible. The comments to these surveys come out a few weeks after the fact and corporate does not care if the bad score you got was not your fault. Completely unfair system, way too much pressure. They continuously punish you and make you feel terrible about your scores if they aren't good even if you try really hard to do well."
bad,Not a good environment to work in.  Compensation is extremely low compared to other companies with the same duties and responsibilities.  Management does not care about the concerns of the employees. No room for financial advancement.
bad,"You do not want to work for this company! You are told one thing during the interview and training process but once you are in your branch, everything you were promised goes right out the window!"
bad,"Why is PNC unable to retain good and dedicated employees?  Why does PNC MICO Manage?  Why does PNC promote employees  that"
bad,"Not applicable Job Work/Life Balance Not good"
bad,"The bank is planning on converting to virtual banking despite negative reviews. The plan is to fire employees randomly and reduce the expenses. "
bad,"I was the “face of PNC” at one of our several retail banking branches located within a supermarket. I report to the Branch Manager and Regional Manger as well as our Sales Support and Service Manager. Combining strong service skills and sales initiative to create new customer relationships and retaining existing ones within a retail-based market and sales-focused professional environment"
bad,You the closers job and LO's job. You are not compensated for your hard work. THIS IS NOT THE PLACE YOU DREAM TO WORK FOR. Management does not know their right shoulder from their left. With TRID being implemented due to government regulations it makes it hard to get accurate policies and information.
bad,"No room for advancement.  Terrible pay and benefits.  Other financial institutions are better to work for than PNC, try them before coming to this company."
bad,The best part of my day was my co workers they were very supportive with helping me at the beginning. The branch I was working in needs a whole new team of management. They were very negative and selfish not understanding at all. Weren't professional with the staff. Threatens your job every chance they got very miserable people they are. The pay was very low pay 9.57hr  for a lot of work. Work 9 hours only get a half hour break but the managers work 9 hours they get 45 minutes. Six day work week never have time for anything else but work no overtime they make sure they stretch your hours over the 6 days.
bad,"Management only looks out for themselves. All they care about are the numbers and hitting the insights button to ensure we're having the pnc conversation with every client. They set unrealistic expectations for workers. There will only be 2 or 3 tellers on a busy day and have the line out the door, and expect you to still try and sell a credit card to someone who is frustrated for waiting in line for almost 20 minutes. Extremely frustrating!!! They're now beginning to push out people who make an average salary of $30,000 a year to give their position to someone who is younger and will do the job for less. Where is the loyalty behind that!!!"
bad,Corporate and regional managers only care about their pockets and have no feelings for anyone doing the actual work. They pressure everyone to meet high numbers that are unrealistic and then fire people because they want less people to do more work
bad,"This bank is focused only on making and saving money no matter how many customer's or employees are screwed over in the process. They claim they care about being green, employees, and customers but it is all a lie. PNC is moving toward branches operated by two people with no teller lines to save on payroll. If you want to cash a check a person will walk you to an ATM that is able to cash it for you if you have a PNC account. No face to face human interaction other that the wall the bank of ATM's along the wall where a teller line used to exist. You can only sit with someone if you are interested in purchasing another PNC product. This bank is a joke, if youre thinking of applying, don't."
bad,"Don't even waste your time...I did and will regret that I put in almost 2 years of my life that I will never be able to recoup again. From branch management (or should I say lack of?) all the way on up, I just felt like it was an out of control 3 ring circus each and every day. The only thing that really and "
bad,"3 Stars, not a great place to work, no work life balance, no support, or teamwork, or leadership. The schedule is terrible the management is terrible and the system is terrible.  I would not recommend this job to anyone."
bad,"I am not impressed with this company overall.  They do not care abut their employees.  It shows in the overall attitude of management, their benefits package, and the work life balance options available.  They are available, however, extremely hard to get approved."
bad,Overall I didn't have a great experience at PNC. The upper management has no clue to what is going on in the branches. I would recommend going to a larger bank that actually values their associates
bad,Everything about this is really bad.  No opportunities to grow.  Diversity is not even a work they have ever heard.  Really bad experience and will never work again to this company.
bad,"The distribution model that PNC Bank has put in place in the grocery market is laughable at best. The absolute lack of professionalism, and poor quality of senior management, guiding the process leaves the employee feeling like a preschooler approaching a school bully in the aisles of the store."
bad,the Management was unprofessional.  The guidelines were unclear.  The was no help or chance for advancement.  I felt alone when I had questions.  It seemed that everyone was micro managed so much so that it took the personality of of the employee.
bad,"not happy there, compensation is not worth the amount of work put in, management is not where it should be. Sales goals are required, but if customer service score for branch is low then you lose all the sales you accomplished."
bad,"I was not happy working for PNC unfortunately they promote salesmen to be managers without management growth and that's not right "
bad,did not like this job at all. after 90 day trial period both the company and I knew this was not the job for me.
bad,"Worst company I have ever worked for. The turn over rate is astronomical. When I got hired I had no ""hands on"" training, was thrown right into the position. The TS at the branch is horrible, mean and arrogant. Not family orientated business what so ever as they make their selfs out to be. Was promised I would be working 30 hours a week, with benefits and vacation time, got none of the above. The first of the year was cut down to 22 hours. No room for advancedment. Would not recommend anyone to work here!"
bad,PNC does not care enough for their employees. you are only numbers to them.
bad,I worked at pnc bank for almost a year and at 1st it was OK then the true colors came out. I would work 40 plus hrs with no weekends and if i were to ask for a weekend off i was treated with an attitude and then talked about behind my back. Their was always a shortage on staff always breach in the way that the cash was handled in the vault and the cash boxes. It was awful  every day that i went to work and the very last day i worked their i worked 10 hr day with no lunch then they pulled me off the line and walked me to the door!!!! I would never advise any one to work their.
bad,"The people at this branch are awful to work for, very few believe in teamwork. As a former employee I am glad I left."
bad,"This company was the worst that I worked for, the company has bad management"
bad,"By far the worst bank I have ever worked for, and the worst job I have ever had.  The management in the southeast is ignorant to the market place and they are way under qualified for their positions.  The emphasis on checking accounts is pathetic and they do not provide incentives for the amount they stress them.  If you want to go to Wal-Mart to beg people for checking accounts, this is your place.  Otherwise, work somewhere else.  The only reason I worked here as long as I did was because of the people I worked with.  We all hated our jobs together."
bad,"always multitasking, generating ideas to increase sales, managers very friendly. Very limited option to value education and match this with compensation."
bad,"Though PNC's product mix can virtually fit anyone to satisfy the customers needs they don't have the same attention to detail for their employees. My position was helping customers find the right product mix for their financial portfolio. Including, but not limited to, all banking & lending products and other credit options. Then matching the customer to the right investment product. Thoroughly enjoyed making sure my customers were happy and satisfied with my recommendations. My co-workers and I worked hard everyday and learned our jobs though PNC prides themselves in hiring managers that have appeal but no experience in sales or customer service."
bad,The best thing about this place was the customers I helped and developed deeper relationships with.
bad,I worked with a great group of women until the two branches in our town consolidated then every thing we were told was not the truth and I lost my confidence in my future with the bank
bad,"rude management, very unprofessional staff. no one knew there job responsibilities at all. i thought working at the bank would be a amazing step up for me, but it was a huge disappointment an a huge step backwards."
bad,"I've had a great career in banking with the exception of PNC Bank. No platform training, poor management and be prepare to use a script that has a pass or fail model that might cost you your job. PNC Bank is definitely not a company I would recommend anyone to. The people I worked with were under-paid and over-worked. The RM seems like a great position but trust me it isn't the dream job they sold me. BEWARE!!!"
bad,no rules no guidelines the poorest management group ever in jacksonville florida.
bad,"Was not the company they claimed to be. They said they would take care of their employees first because they need to be taken care of so that our customer's can be taken care of. When my work performance started to decline, they never once asked me what was the cause. They just let me go."
bad,"The work is not to heard"
bad,"New company with high hopes, but the business failed, and people were laid off."
bad,"PNC has a great reputation for Financial Services and Banking, mortgages, not so much.  In Southern California, they are known for causing problems for Short Sellers and their realtors, by holding out for more money in a 2nd lien position, and settling with regulators for large amounts of money for mortgage related infractions.  But this is all stuff that you’re able to overcome with strong relationships."
bad,If you ever work for a bank then you will know that each banks are pretty much the same unless they truly value their employee's well being first.  
bad,"This was my first bank job as a teller and each day"
bad,A place that really did not meet the expectations that were presented to me
bad,drive you to suicide
bad,"Company is selfish, doesn't care about there employees. They have lots of harrasment going around that they keep under the radar and try to keep there employees quite. Pay is horrible. They treat you like a slave. My advice, be unemployed before you work here ever."
bad,PNC was the worst company I have worked for in my 40 years of work experience. I wouldn't recomend even banking with them!
bad,good people...easy work...Easy computer system and good work life balance.
bad,"Worst experience at a job ever, very rude and most helpful employees... No team work... Absolute nightmare"
bad,PNC does not care about it's employees one bit. All they care about is the shareholder and the fat cats in upper mgt
bad,To much favoritism in this company! LOw pay! Not the most friendly environment... Catty co workers
bad,A wasteful company that doesn't pay its employees enough to actually live in the city limits. But it can afford to have a food truck driving around town handing out hot dogs to homeless people.
bad,"Meager compensation. Awful management. HR supports upper management, not the worker bee. They say all the right things, but the corporate environment is horrible. Good luck ever getting managerial support or a decent pay raise."
bad,"Lowest compensation in the market. Corporate greed abundant. Customers and employees, are treated as fee income. Management has not a clue. MLO's run, don't walk away from this company !"
bad,"Bottom line you are a machine here, your not a person. If you decide to work here be prepared that everything is micromanaged and there is no way for you to be imperfect"
bad,"Manager was unprofessional, coworker was unprofessional, in the mid time they go home and do your laundering and after come back in branch , costumer service was bad out side ATM they was not consider service with customer and coworkers and manager are raciest and they behaved with new people with very bad my experience was very bad with PNC I think they have to focus in internal management."
bad,PNC does not care about their employees. Their management team is awful and focuses solely on themselves. The sales culture they push on their employees creates a stressful work environment. It’s constant conversation on how you are going to improve while the managers continue to not help customers or follow through on their word. They do not pay you enough and if you get promoted the easier is a joke. They pay more to new hires then they do to current employees. WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND ANYBODY TO WORK HERE OR BANK HERE.
bad,"There isn't much to say other than the pay was horrible, management was terrible and there was zero space to advance. I spent most of my time trying to advance working overtime and then would get horrible raises after over achieving."
bad,"Market Management racist and unfair environment, South Jersey Region is the worst; if you are Latino or black people prepare to be targeted by the Regional manager, I guess  in a world that is ok to make racist jokes and comments, you will never have respect if you say something they will haunt you down until you quit."
bad,"Horrible experience, lied to REPEATEDLY about promotions that never came to fruition, work 6 days a week most weeks, SO MUCH PRESSURE to sell services and products constantly.  Always a meeting, a report, a conference call, a list to keep, phone calls to make, emails to send and all that for a TELLER position. Do more,  sell more, push more, non- stop never ending shove more sales"
bad,"Under no circumstances would I work there again. Training is awful, management unappreciative and career advancement is hard to get for a management position. Alot of last minute decisions such as an hr long call night announced for personal bankers the night of for after hours. Even if you meet and exceed your goals every quarter, management wants more and looks for reasons to hold anything you mess up as valid reason for no promotions."
bad,"I worked for Pnc for a year and a half. "
bad,The stressful environment and unrealistic expectations from management are not even close to the pay. No chance to move up or advance. They really sell that concentrix is such a dream job but it is nowhere close to what was promised. Very disappointed as I thought I had found a stable job with a growing company.
bad,"If you enjoy no work/life balance and “management” that rewards brown nosing, apply. They are hands down the WORST company I’ve ever had the displeasure working at. I cannot think of one positive thing to say. Training is horrible, and they penalize you for going past break and lunch to help the customer."
bad,The culture of this company has become stagnant and is not progressing. It is not a culture where an employee is able to thrive at this time. Hopefully the culture will progress soon
bad,"It was mostly my trainer/facilitator that turned me off after I accepted my new position. First off, I was expecting the typical call center environment, but I was not expecting the whole brainwash theatrics regarding how rewarding it is to work for $15.00 an hour (which is still considered poverty level) and how much PNC bank and its CEO want you to succeed and move up within their company. Of course, working for someone else will always keep them at the top, and you as a replaceble employee, so please spare me. Anyways, my facilitator talked about how micromanaging is what they do not do - that was a lie. She literally admitted to moving/zooming our cameras around during virtual training in order to see if we were on our phones and/or doing other things. One day, my system froze, and I could not click my camera back on when we returned from break, so I told her (via phone) that I was here but may have to restart my computer due to it being frozen. She responds passive aggressively by stating ""we returned from break a few minutes ago but thanks for telling me"". Ma'am, we returned from break at 9:48AM. It is now 9:50AM. I tried to get the computer to work for 2 minutes before saying anything; sorry if that was too long. "
bad,"Most stressful job I have ever had. At the end I was having panic attacks every morning before walking in to start my shift. I felt harassed by Management to meet quotas. I do not have a problem referring and selling. The majority of our clients were Elderly and on a fixed income. I could not sell lines of credit to them, that they could not afford. I couldnt sell home equity lines of credit to people who were renting, mostly in a fixed income complex. The pay is a SLAP IN THE FACE! I made a little over $9 at the end."
bad,"The organization and management are absolutely awful here, HR does absolutely nothing literally so worthless I am not sure why they even have an HR dept since they let low end managers make their own rules set even over the PNC policies put into place. Even when meeting goals you are constantly threatened about your job and needing to do better even as top performers. No encouragement whatsoever only negativity."
bad,"This company fired me for “not making enough sales” AS A TELLER. I have worked for banks for years and have never heard of such a ridiculous expectation. I know the real reason they fired me, which is a form of discrimination. They do not appreciate their employees, they demand more than what your job entails, and they will work you to death."
bad,"I used to love and rave about coming to work at PNC. But then the culture really started changing. How people are treated is so inconsistent there it truly boggles the mind. No open communication anywhere in the company. Everything is so compartmentalized good luck finding out what you need to know if you did not know who to go to."
bad,"PNC will only allow you to receive certain advancements that only they allow and barely any type of raise, but will higher someone else outside the company who could possibly be making 10k more than you just for coming from outside the company. They do not help out employees for doing good in the company and advancing."
bad,"I would not recommend PNC Bank because of the type of behaviors required by management. A banker job should focus on the client experience, not taking advantage of clients."
bad,"PNC was a horrible place to work. The management was rude, condescending and there was minimal training before you were graded and chastised for your poor performance. The pay was far too low for the amount of responsibility employees were given ($11/hr but handling upwards of $300,000 in cash daily). Employees are expected to sell products but never given any training on what PNC has to offer or how those products work, yet you are expected to meet daily, monthly, and quarterly sales goals. Employees are paid commission, but you have to work for the company for at least 6 months before it is paid out, and it is paid out a quarter behind, so you won't see any commission for nearly a year. The company does regular and mandatory performance reviews and goal setting, but no options for advancement are ever given and no raises are ever given. You are given 15 PTO days and 6 separate sick days, but there are stringent guidelines on how PTO can be used and you can only take one full week off per year and can only take 2 long weekends (because you have to work Saturdays in banking). It is absolutely unbearable, and I would NEVER work here again."
bad,"This is a sales position. They are very competitive with their goals; however, the salary sucks. They pay the least of all banks and they will negotiate."
bad,"It was very frustrating working at PNC. Anytime a customer got upset or had a disagreement it automatically became the employee's fault. I've been called out my name, cursed out, etc yet every time I was the one who got written up. The manager was never available to help us nor did she ever stick up for her employees. I just had to accept that no one cares about me as an individual. I'm just another employee that is replaceable.  After my new manager came in the job was no longer enjoyable. I cried everyday before coming in just because it was a depressing atmosphere."
bad,PNC Bank has mixed review. From what I witnessed. It depends on what area you work in to your happiness. My side has been mostly retail. I would not recommend retail. I am not sure if the upper level management in our region even understands how a team environment works. I believe they are the main issue.
bad,"Lack of organization, bad leadership, outdated technology and processes. Do not recommend working for this lack luster bank. Terrible terrible terrible"
bad,Working there is equivalent to watching paint dry. Adequate training is very seldom. Employee turnover is rare and you'd probably have better luck working for a temp agency.
bad,"Worked in a small branch that got very little foot traffic yet was still expected to open or refer a certain amount of new accounts with nobody walking in the door. On top of that, PNC does everything in it's power to keep customers out of the branch because it's cheapest checking account requires customers to do all their business through the ATM or they will receive a monthly fee. PNC does not do right by their tellers; they do most of the work in the branch, assume all the liability (any bad check will cost you your job), and are expected to reach unrealistic sales goals on a skeleton staff. Go into a PNC bank, it will be empty but for one or two tellers max and their drive thru lines will most likely be shut down as well."
bad,too stressful with other staff trying to make sales numbers look good by selling things the client didn't want or need. too cut throat and competitive for me
bad,"-typical day at work was stressful"
bad,PNC talks out of both sided of their mouths. On one hand they talk about only doing what is right for the customer and on the other one they talk about meeting goals in specific areas. For example we need more credit cards and this is the focus. Current regional manager is not diplomatic and talks down to employees. Does not care about work life balance. No grace for mistakes or not meeting goals.
bad,"Don't really know where to start but the company was National City bank which was later brought out by PNC bank, they decided to change the culture and make it like Chase Bank . Following the merger completion, the culture completely changed and everything went down the tube. Would have loved to stay but they also got rid of all the good managers and leaders , demanding more but unwilling to to reflect it with the pay. Truly disappointed and a frustrating experience."
bad,"Organization is in flux, due to a number of reorganization and cost cutting measures. Thus, workers are trying to figure out the new structure and goals. As such, people are “looking over their shoulders” and not focusing on conduct business."
bad,Mass confusion. A Manager that was untruthful with the public and employees. The hardest part of the job was working with customers who had been told something by management and then expected you to make it happen.
bad,"I worked for this bank for close to 5 years, and while I had the opportunity to work with genuinely good hard-working people, I finally had to go. Despite excellent reviews each year, the promised raises were never above 1.25%, even though the newspaper listed the CEO's raises as 43% one year and more recently around 14%. The benefits?  Sound good on paper, but the deductible is $3,000 per year per insured person. They say the hire the best and the brightest but those people either laugh at the low salaries or leave after a year or two. I worked for other local banks, so I can compare. This company does NOT value their employees, and it will eventually cost them as more and more of them leave for greener pastures. I did."
bad,I am thankful for the opportunity and knowledge I received at PNC.  I've worked for the company for almost 6 years and I have worked very hard in my position.
bad,"When will they learn that the best way to get your employees to give exceptional customer service is to treat your employees the way you want them to treat the customers?"
bad,"PNC's management in my particular branch was incredibly mediocre and created a hostile work environment. Though I did my best to learn the skills necessary to be successful, it seemed as if my manager wanted me to fail."
bad,"It's not a family oriented culture like it was when National City was the company, they took care of their employees and now that it's PNC they only take care of the Executive."
bad,Not a nice place to work. There is not much room for advancement unless you know someone. The credit card department is the worst department to go into.
bad,Talking about losely coupled management styles with highly muddy politics with no professional advancement. Management is hired and fired without professional issues and Managers are lobbying immature management styles with Group Directors and Co-Managers to budget a project without professional management experience. Interested to grow professional career not an intuitive place to start or consider
bad,"A very inviting and well kept place, it's once you're in reality hits"
bad,Seemingly very little room for advancement.  Genuinely good candidates are overlooked and more work is created than necessary by having to train new hires from zero background instead of pulling people currently working at company
bad,"They will hire almost anyone. Management is not very well put together, and the concept of what they want you to do in a grocery store branch is just not a good strategy."
bad,"There is no point in trying to achieve greatest here as it is as political as Washington D.C.   "
bad,"If you enjoy figjting internally over a deal, having to cut yourself out of getting full credit for bringing in a piece of business in to make everyone's score card nice and pretty, tolerate obvious favortism of management for certain co-workers and have human reaources ignore interviewing employees who support your case, this the place for you. If you exceed your goals on paper, local management will make excuses that YOU cannot clearly have a full bonsus as those who did not make their goals deserve ""something"". People have been forced out the door for perceptions of management but who did great jobs. Fighting back makes you the problem. Do not respond to 'how can we help you be more productive' as a sincere response comes back to haunt you. The last manager brought no business in but ruled like a slave driver in ruling by fear.The current one brings business in but only lets certain people in on the deal. If you need to shine do not come  here unless you want to shine  shoes. When you are measured by metrics and management abandons you, you are done."
bad,Working with PNC mortgage was very unproductive.  Management team is VERY unproductive and uneducated about their processes.
bad,"Poor management, poor healthcare (insurance is from Pennsylvania  - it works different in state of IL). Blame management for employees resigning there positions. There is no respect to human and employees rights... There is no work and life balance, nobody ask you if you are able to work almost 60 hours per week! Incompetent and selfish teller supervisor. There is so much favoritism with this branch. I do not regret I resigned my position. One of the worst places to work for! "
bad,Poor Employee relations...and poor treatment of Individual employee by Managers
bad,Upper management does not care about its people or their work life balance ...its all work and no life.. lots of misrepresentation in the interview process your told one thing by recruiter and then once you accept the postion things are not the way they were told to you ..I was a branch manager i choose to leave because of poor treatment from my regional she was clearly not qualified to have the postion she held and has no people skills whatsoever and a complete lack of respect for her direct reports time and skills HR needs to seriously review what is going on there
bad,"over 120 mortgage files for one processor, you can only close 30-40 tops per month, They never close purchases in time don't pay overtime."
bad,"Most managers in the region that I worked were not qualified to give the tools to help advance employees. They were either not motivated or simply not skilled. Benefits were great, pay was okay, last but not least the technology was outdated and slow. You'd find yourself apologizing to the customer about wait times and rebooting computers daily. I tried but no growth."
bad,"I never felt more about place in my life. PNC always has openings in the Fayetteville area because people quit, it’s hard to get promoted. Management only worries about how many credit cards you get everyday. Regional manager will do “training on the spot” in front of your coworkers and not give any sort of constructive feedback. Be aware that if you work for this region your personal life will be expected to put on second, business is always first. Vacation time will be approved if and only Reginal Manager approves it."
bad,This company changed from the time I started working there until the time I left.   They no longer have a vision for the mortgage industry and did not value experience or quality.  The focus is not on the customer.
bad,"If you want to work among the most arrogant, self-important snobs who have no education or pedigree to back it up, go join PNC.  Their model is a mess, they pretend to be ultra high net worth when they are barely mass affluent   They care nothing about the client and only care about their fees  "
bad,Abysmal support from management: worst two managers I had in 25+ years of work in the industry. Total misunderstanding of wealth management business; sell a loan that’s how banks make money is the mantra
bad,"There was favoritism shown at this job, people were allowed to not work and then other employees had to pick up the slack from that other person. There is no growth opportunities."
bad,Job Duties are not as advertised or applied for leading to zero job satisfaction and career development support.  The PNC group I worked for made lots of promises but failed to fulfill most of them.
bad,I was a new employee and my onboarding was very bad.  Very stressful.  Lack of training on policy and procedures.  No mentor.  Sink and swim training.
bad,Too much negative to say about this company and do  ot want to Express my opinion.  People will find out for themselves.. Def not paid well and incentive is horrible
bad,Your experience depends on who you’re manager is.. like with every job they can make or break your motivation to stay. If you apply under a certain role you will not be hired outside of that roles ‘trajectory’.. Be prepared to pay an arm and a leg for insurance with an extra high deducible..
bad,"The culture is if your not buddies, they will talk to you like you don't matter and get away with it. Team leads are a joke and take it to the sup they friends so the conversation goes no where. The work schedule is 1030-7 they short staffed. PNC has a high turnover. Training good luck you have so many people that train and treat you in a different style. I showed for incoming calls for 3 weeks then expect you to be ready"
bad,"Regional management will micro manage each employee without any consideration of working conditions, clientele and severe under staffing.  They expect employees to do more work than demanded by their position to get a ""meets all expectations"" in all 5 categories for the semi annual review(every 6 months).  If you miss one  ""meet all expectations"" you cannot apply for any other positions within PNC as one of the questions you have to answer when applying for a promotion (step-up job) is ""What was the lowest score on your last semi annual review"".  If you answer ""met some expectations"" the applications will not let you continue further."
bad,"Horrible management. I dont know how that woman Is still in charge of that financial institution,  completely unprofessional, racist, and does not look out for the customers or employees best interest, I could not by good conscious and morals continue to work for such a person and walked away from my career!"
bad,"They have a very tough time outside of their main footprint states which are the Midwest. Have not made much of a dent in GA, AL, FL, etc. PNC will probably end up exiting the Southeast to focus on their better markets"
bad,Management hostile and discriminatory. For example management brought cake in for everyone to share put it on back counter. I had a soda (closed) put on back counter and was yelled at for it in front of customers. The next day someone else put drink on back counter and nothing said. For whatever reason I was singled out. I also never got a raise in 18 months?
bad,PNC wasn't a bad place to work by any means but biggest complaints would be no salary increases and very little growth opportunity. Management tends to not be engaged with their teams and have very little offer by way of mentorship.
bad,Nothing positive to say about them. It was a great opportunity to learn the mortgage business however PNC had a lot of Racist and friend based promotions on the operation end of the business. On the servicing end of the business it was more diverse.
bad,"Constant changes; work, co workers, mgrs. "
bad,Goals are set where at 100% production you still arent able to hit goal.  Asked to where the hat of many other roles. Virtually no support or training.  Tons of micro management.
bad,"Does not practice what it preaches.  Management by intimidation. Hawthorn senior leadership inexperienced and therefore created an environment  where there was 100% turnover in one group. Despite protestations of “culture”, at the end of the day the leaders are only interested in own career.  Do not think that if you work for a woman, as a woman you will be treated fairly.  Women leadership are the most in fear of other strong, smart women."
bad,"This company boasts a work life balance as one of it's most important factors. Well, maybe if you're at the top, otherwise I have never had less of a balance in my working career. There is no support from management and even if you beg for ""Required"" training, often the branches are too busy to schedule you for it. I was there for 2 years unable to complete new hire required courses! This place might work for you, but it was the worst financial institution I have ever worked for. Way too much stress!"
bad,"Very difficult to advance, depending on what tier you're hired on. If it isn't captured in a number, it's easily overlooked. Hard work and initiative will not be compensated, and recommendations, even from tenured staff (depending on level), will not, measurable, aid a competitive advantage."
bad,"Good company , low pay , no ability to grow within . Poor management . Some types of favoritism and discrimination as well . High stress for sales only ."
bad,A typical day consists of assisting clients in the branch and by phone.  You are required to report to your manager your activities for the day before you leave.
bad,they didn't care about your future at pnc they just need to make sure you got your numbers by any means possible. management always popped up unannounced and then my manager would always act like a completely different person.
bad,"While working for PNC, we were expected to be independent and not need our managers; then when we had an issue with a client, we were taken to task for not getting the managers involved."
bad,Terrible Job. Terrible hours. Customers were always rude and disrespectful. Half of the time PNC did something to screw the customer. The other half were customers who just didn't know how to manage money and took it out on you because they were broke.
bad,"This job started out very well and promising, with my intention to move up and to different areas of the company. However, the past 6 months have shown inept management and an unwillingness to follow through on promised work from home time, due to extenuating personal circumstances. As I have no confidence in current management and feel incredibly disrespected in a variety of ways, I cannot recommend working here and am looking for another job."
bad,"I worked in the Financial Services group and was completely mislead about the position I was hired for."
bad,"Micromanagement at its best. All about sales and numbers at the end of the day, despite what they tell you. If you are a seasoned banker, stay away from them. PNC wants inexperienced people so they can mold them into what they think a banker should be. They do not value experience. Pay is woefully short compared to their competitors.  They think their process is the end all to be all. If there is a problem, they believe the people are the problem and not their process. Very arrogant bank."
bad,This employer offered a wonderful benefits package but they were not consistent in their treatment of associates.  There was a multitude of favoritism and lack of responsibility taken by managers.
bad,"Horrible, deflating workplace. Lowest pay in the business. Deductible is $3000/yr per insured person. Bosses work from home and don't want to be bothered when they're required to be in the office. They flat out tell you you can't earn more than a 1% raise despite strong evaluations unless you work in sales or management. Good people work hard then get disgusted and leave. High turnover rate. Too concerned with seeing their logo on stadiums, buses, even trash cans than to pay a liveable wage. They will use you UP."
bad,"I've learned much about banking operations and have enjoyed making friends of several co-workers.  I've enjoyed working with clients that I will miss seeing on a regular basis.  I've learned about their lives and helped make a difference in their financial well-being."
bad,I was a branch manager for 5 years. It was a great place to work until they had a change in the Regional Manager. I left after 5 years of being their due to that change.If not for that reason i feel i would still be there.
bad,Terrible company to work for. They don't care about their employees and let you know all the time that you are replaceable. If your successful its never good enough and if your too successful on your bonuses They find a reason to get rid of you.
bad,"This was the type of job that gives you training, and seemingly plenty of it, yet when you actually get to the implementation it is vastly different. The scenarios given and the training provided does not, realistically, give you any sense of what you will be doing on a day to day basis. Once training ends, you are essentially on your own and any questions you ask can be answered any number of different ways depending on who you ask. It is rather haphazard and not recommended."
bad,"My experience with PNC was terrible. There was a high employee turnover rate, the training that I received was horrible (made us do a bunch of web training), the pay was extremely low"
bad,"worked for them for 6 years laid off with zero notice, do not care about their employees, only care about shareholders. would not recommend to work for."
bad,This was one of the most stressful places that I have ever worked. Corporate was very demanding and expected you to sell to every person that walked through the door. They pushed all the low income customers out the door and didn't want to even deal with them. It was a very sad place to work.
bad,Management conducted an unorganized projects. During the project was changes was not planned. In the middle of the project they laid off staff during the Holidays.
bad,I would rather not say a whole lot of negative about this company. but i will say to use it as a stepping stone and get out. take your experience elsewhere.
bad,May be good atmosphere for less seasoned employees.  Not a professional environment for seasoned individuals.  Good for just out of high school building a career.
bad,"The customers were great and the other teller was wonderful, higher management sucks and they do not care about their employees at all."
bad,"Was once a great Bank...no longer true"
bad,Horrible place of business . They give you hours over the phone once u get hired on they hours change they stick with an all day shift with no support.
bad,This place demands a lot from the employees and pays absolutely nothing. HR lies about pay to get you in the door. PNC is an outdated lockbox that need to invest better equipment and a better process.
bad,"Manger is total nut case! She will stalk you on Facebook and other social networks, get other employees in the branch to find out about your personal life by stalking you as well. She Daily does things to make it horrible to work with her. She constantly bullies her employees into thinking that she has the power to fire you at any given moment, she delegates her work out to all the employees and does basically nothing herself, if you ask her a question she gets angry at you and retaliates by giving you more work to do that she is suppose to be doing. She offers no positive feed back about the work you do only responses with negativity. Upper management has been informed of this and still nothing is done with this woman. Best watch your back if you go to work here! Not just with management but with all employees at branch!"
bad,"The only good thing I have to say about PNC is that they are a good place to gain entry level experience in banking.  Once you get your experience though get the heck out!  Their training is horrendous, all they care about are SALES #'s.  They didn't care that I had a customer service score of 4.98/5.00 (yes, Gallup the company that conducts polling will randomly call your customers to ascertain satisfaction.)  All I heard after carrying such a high service score was I was doing a bad job and all this other BS just because my sales numbers were middle of the pack.  My biggest gripe with this company is the pay, it is PATHETIC!!!.  My annual raise was .15 cents an hour.  I started making 11.50 / hr, after my ""Big"" promotion I was making 12.50 /hr.  The majority of the customers that you will see on a given day will be very escalated due to poor company training and no accountability.  So your day basically consists of putting out fires other people started.  Customer Service incentives were easy to hit however the sales goals were nearly impossible.  Management wants you to be a robot for the company and never question processes that are made by people who haven't been in a retail branch in 10 years."
bad,"The environment has been difficult with so much turn-over in Management. In one year I'm on my 3rd manager who's been in place for 4 months and already has one foot out the door! It raises a great deal of concern for the team. What is upper managment thinking in their hiring decisions for managers. So much talent exists within the team that their hiring decision could have made so much more sense by promoting from within. Team members are beginning to look elsewhere for opportunites outside of the company due their less than acceptable practices. To boot, salaries and compensation in at least the sales division is one of the poorest ever experienced. Big Box store greeters are being equally compensated or more than our sales consultants who hold great responsibility and are responsible for making the company money! Those billion dollar quarters are not possible without the main revenue producing division: SALES...Not sure if ever the company will take a step back and realize where their priorities need to be vs. where they are."
bad,"it's horrible being stuck in a grocery store, my manager didn't really care what we did or our growth."
bad,"Management reserves the right to encourage by threat. Very distrustful place to work. Constantly have to watch your back. Started its decline in 2008 when two banks came together. Market Management does not understand PNC Culture and creates friction. Operational manager looks to find problems. Local Sales Manager feels threat are the only way to go. Branch personal were great to work with, unfortunately PNC Values like Integrity, Teamwork, Work Life Balance were non existent."
bad,"I literally dread coming to work there, manadatory overtime everyday!! and they dont pay you for it, you are required to come in later the next day to balance out your time. Team leads are not knowlegable regarding the job itself, at least not on my shift."
bad,"PNC can’t hire any loan officers due to the accuracy of bad management, vanilla products and green processing/ underwriting reputation it has. No one is capable or willing to help you because they are lazy and looking out for themselves. Very poor mortgage department."
bad,"I worked for PNC for 5 years.  The regional manager made everyone miserable.  If she did not like you you were marked to get fired.  I was harassed.  Eventually, the manager asked me to input a clients ID to issue new debit card even though the client did not have his ID with him,  because we ""KNEW"" him as a customer.  I was reluctant but at the managers insistence issued him a new debit card anyway.  Of course I was  then fired.  WHAT A JOKE AND WASTE OF 5 YEARS."
bad,Horrible management not a place that would ever recommend to anyone. They do not care about you as a customer. It’s all about the bottom line. It’s about making money and nothing else.
bad,"PNC call center was not worth the pay, especially in core. You get yelled at all day, and they put you on the phones before you are fully trained. There is a strict schedule to adhere to and if you need to talk to your boss you have to do so on your break or you are off schedule and you WILL get in trouble. I had a coworker who had medical issues and PNC refused to work with her. I had some major mental health issues and despite scoring high in all my areas they refused to work with me and told me to “suck it up.”"
bad,Management worked behind my back to bust me down to a teller and then wanted me to train person who took my position. Management showed favoritism .  I left and moved all my accounts!
bad,"They love to talk about Wells Fargo, but they worse on the sales goals and very pushy. The benefits are great but the culture wasn't. They need to listen more to the employees and have a more diverse employees."
bad,"MAJOR favoritism and nepotism at this company. Managers are rude, lazy, and lack knowledge and HR will not support you if you report issues against management. Training is awful and the work equipment is garbage. There seems to always be something broken and at times customers are intentionally inconvenienced (without their knowledge) when the company wants to ""test""something new."
bad,I believe a company should be graded on how they treat customers and employees. I worked at this location and I was forced to watch the door half my day everyday and was told that my numbers would double everyday and they WANTED me to feel stressed out and overloaded so I would produce better numbers. I was as a new employee only 4 weeks in this branch told off and humiliated in front of a customer because I didn’t know how to do it ( I was told I got it when I didn’t. when I tried to object I was than told u got it like it’s easy A second time. During this process I tried to ask my branch manager for help (you know so I can do it right) but she was chatting with a friend instead of offering assistance. Turns out I didn’t Open an account correctly and literally got told off infront of the customer and humiliated.) I had enough of the lack of training and that awful experience made me contact HR but With me being within the 90 day period I felt I didn’t matter because it took over a week for a response. I ended up calling her out and the branch manager came in and tried to blame it on me not trying to listen to there “teachings”. They would threaten me about 90 days coming up and me having to take it seriously. Keep in mind I literally had to stand in the lobby half of my day. I was setup for failure and humilated and harassed ( they would tell me I can’t touch my beard and talk about how I would sit when making calls). I was fired for refusing to take there training and produce numbers. I was told it’s like a retail store if u don’t like it you give it back. Than she fired me.
bad,"As a Loan Officer, this company is behind the times on technology, practices and processes. When your job is sales and you loss money  because of your company that is never good"
bad,Let me start by saying... I was not fired and I do not have an axe to grind with PNC. I spent a few years there and it was one of the most highly disorganized places to work with unrealistic goals. They will promise you the world but never deliver on their end of the bargain. When I was there the turnover was the worst I have ever seen. They could not keep anyone staffed. they moved new leadership down from Pittsburgh to change the direction of the bank. The senior leadership team could careless about the employees. They only care about hitting goals at ANY cost.The entire state of NC is ran by people who treat the employees like livestock. They use you and dispose of you when you no longer hit the unrealistic goals. They will write you up and fire you at the drop of a hat.  PNC has almost no market share in NC but they will expect you to produce the same numbers as your counterparts in Pittsburgh. Makes little to no sense. Everyone that is in a sales role there is miserable and constantly looking for a way out. I am happily employed at a smaller community bank and could not be happier. Please think twice before you do the mega bank route. You will live to regret it.
bad,"Responsible for all aspects of branch production and personnel."
bad,"I started in June 2017 in the Whitehall call center before everyone started working from home. I had a really cool training class though. Boy, the management sure does know how to get the newbies hyped up for foolishness. The last day of training, people started to leave. PNC is a stressful place to work indeed. From the time you log in to CATCH and turn on Spirit, the calls will be back-to-back with calls regarding disputes, transactions, etc. This bank has some terrible fees was well. There's a saying in the company regarding ""Overdraft Tuesdays"" when customers would notice a positive balance in their accounts from Friday thru Monday, then Tuesday the funds are gone. The customer is under the impression that their balance wasn't negative over the weekend. This is just one of many issues that PNC needs to update and fix. Too many bogus expectations there as well. You can have a whole week of good calls, but the audit team will find your worst call and grade you on that, so they won't give you your deserved bonus. The team leads have their teams working like busy-bees so that their ""manager's"" numbers can look good. One thing that I did like was the small cafe and the self-service store in the building. Besides that, it was ratchet."
bad,"Poor management, long working hours. Some of the customers can very unfriendly. Stressful working environment, unpaid one hour lunch and you spend one hour each day working longer. Good benefits but that’s about it. Some weeks you are required to work 6 days a week. "
bad,"You walk in every day not knowing if it’s goig to be your last. The management sucks, and they’re not supportive of you. This company is very discriminatory and will choose their favorites."
bad,Most people had hours where there tour stated in the am and ended after dark. It is impossible to have a life outside of work with those hours. The managers are Phony.
bad,"Waiting on customer, processing all their banking needs. Management was not flexible with you for your family life. Working for a bank is a very strict work environment.The sales goals are the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the customers."
bad,"PNC, when hiring tellers, should let interviewees know that they are basically being hired to sell and telemarket.  If you reach your goals you’re told to do more.  If you don’t meet your goals you will be disciplined or they will find reasons to replace you.  Teller skills are not at the top of their list of requirement.  It’s all about the sales.  Even if you get a decent immediate manager, the upper management can be brutal."
bad,"Avoid it if you can, really bad place to work, especially really bad management culture. Managers are incompetent and insecure of people that are more knowledgeable than them. Management takes all strategic decisions by themselves without consulting the technical team."
bad,management will terminate you from pure jealousy. long hours and will cut the opportunity of you making overtime just so management can receive large bonuses.
bad,"Because of the high rate of turn over, you are usually left to do the job of two to three other employees, but you are never compensated properly for it. PNC does not want you to have overtime on your paycheck, yet most days you may not get to take a lunch or be able to offset that over time. PNC lays out rules and policies that only apply to certain people when it benefits them. Management is an absolute joke. If you ever try to leave the company, even if you are in good standing with your coworkers and regional managers, those managers will try everything in their power to ensure you don't get hired anywhere else if they can help it. I know from personal experience. Not to mention sales goals are basically shoved down your throat, and if you don't meet those goals, PNC won't fire you for not meeting the goals, but they WILL fire you for not doing your ""job"". The sales pushing reminds me a lot of Wells Fargo, and if PNC is not careful, they will end up on the same chopping block that Wells Fargo has. I would never recommend this company to ANYONE."
bad,I don't recommend this company to anyone who wants to have a helpful and constructively kind manager. All managers are ruthless and you have no job security and are constantly threatened.
bad,"Quarterly Pay plan is terrible, it's paid 45 days after the end of quarter and if you are not employed at that time you lose the whole payout. It seems like they try their hardest not to pay it out."
bad,The management is supposed to be there to help their employees but at PNC they only help themselves and no one else. You are supposed to feel like you have a best friend while working there but all you get are back stabbers.
bad,"The benefits seem great at first. Until you take vacation they told you was available for use and you quit then you have to pay that all back. Why make that time available? PNC doesn't care about their employees as they don't compensate for the work that's expected. Additionally it's difficult to advance, it doesn't matter if you're the top performer management seems to find a reason to decline a promotion. Management is picky in who they hire, so it takes MONTHS to fill a position, only for a short time later that position to be vacant again (there seems to be a high turnover percentage). Branches are always short staffed which makes it difficult for the employees working because even more work gets put on them. However, I will say the most enjoyable part were the co-workers and the hours. I wouldn't recommend this as a place of employment to a place to bank to anyone."
bad,"I don't agree with the way that the treat African American employees. They have decent healthcare plans. The work environment was very unprofessional and chaotic. The pay was good, however the hectic atmosphere isn't worth it."
bad,"They claim to be a good company but they push sales so much that all the managers are stressed and upper management is micro managing the banks. I was let go after having no write ups and being with the company for a year and a half. Over a small complaint. They shut down branches left and right and change a branch into ""universal"" then let you go if you don't want to work at that branch."
bad,"- At PNC Bank, the training was really bad. The content of the CSR's and Branch employees is almost nonexistent. "
bad,"I worked out of the operations center. At first they hired me to a good position with promises of work life balance and a cooperative work environment and career growth."
bad,"Unfortunately, there is little positive I have to say about my experience as a Sr. Loan Officer at PNC Mortgage."
bad,I was there for 5 years and then they just let me got for one small issue.
bad,"a typical day at work was logging into our phones half would do this half would not if we would all log into our phones like we were suppose to this would have made our lives so much easier...Managers didn't care...I think because at the time it was a new call center maybe? people was calling out...they would just leave wouldn't come back with out notice...then management would try to contact them via mail?? this no call no show no work ethics...it was just a crazy mixed up place...half of the people on things showing up to work??? it was a living night mare working there...I am just glad to be away peace..In my heart I really think the one manager she might have been nice in heart but, they put her in a really position she had no clue about and, it brought out the worse in her too much he said she said too childish there..gives me chills I hope in time they have gotten better."
bad,The most enjoyable part was being my own boss. I really didn't learn anything the was just a temp. Job not my field.
bad,"The best part of this job are the co-workers, the worst part is the favoritism shown by the management staff."
bad,I worked for National City for many years and then came back when is became PNC.  The company puts no emphasis on education.  I never had a supervisor with more education then a high school diploma.  I had a co-worker who was scared to let anyone know she had a degree because she knew it would be held against her.  My supervisor went against every value the company holds.  She never worked a full 40 hour week.  She did her best to humiliate employees by making them participate in children's games and held it against them if they wouldn't participate. She made racist comments on several occasions.  She told employees that they had to score the highest marks on the Gallup Poll because she knew who scored what and you would have to meet with her if you didn't.  The company then rewarded her for her team's high scores on the Gallup Poll.
bad,"It's a mortgage job. The company over staffed at my time of higher and then needed to let us go quickly. Also the manager I worked for was not honest at all. One person can really bring a company down. The company itself is ok, although I was not there long. so I cannot say to much."
bad,"The higher ups at PNC only care about customer satisfaction, and making money. They say they are not like other big banks but that is not true. High pay isn’t worth it. Taking a pay cut to seek other employment. There are surveys that go out to customers, that can make or break your bonuses. There’s been times we’ve received bogus surveys completed by people who are just angry they can’t get their way, and it’s tanked our bonuses that we received and earned. They want you to kiss every customers butt and they do it at the expense of their employees. The pay is great but that’s the only thing and they use that as means to secure you in the job."
bad,"I was as a QA test lead in PNC(TCoE). I am going to tell you my experience with PNC and it's just my subjective opinion. Onboarding and off boarding process is awful, no KT or directing new employee to the right work flow. It is imposible to find any documentation related to the project. Poor weak hardware laptop is proveded for automation with Windows 7 (later upgrated to 10) system which is glitching periodicaly. Scrum master's answer is 'I don't know' for any question. Management system is in very unprofessional level and not orgonized. Developers' manager doesn't understand overall concepts of developing and hiring devs with backend background for frontend project. A lot of ghosts employee which is doing nothing, more truly, they come to have their lunch, drink coffee/tea, and wash their dishes afterall. There is no proper environment for testing, everything should be tested in devs' machine which is unstable and available from time to time. So many mess is in whole Sprint duration. Releases are constantly postponed due to other dependencies. PNC's new up to date web application cannot emerge because of all these kind of issues in management.  If you try to open PNC web app you will see old design which is even not responsive. I wonder whether the stakeholders aware about the lame PNC application. I can continue to criticize every detail of PNC working process for a long time but want to say pnc manager could fire employee for no reason even everything is done on time and properly. Instead of appreciation employee could get fired or get stress."
bad,"I’ve been in the career of banking for roughly 6 years. I’ve NEVER experienced such poor leadership in my life to compare to the one in this branch. I’ve never had a manager tell me to my face “the business comes before you” when I express a  concern of lack of work/life balance in the workplace. Due to my recent life event changes of me having to move to a different state, I applied to PNC. When I arrived to my interview 15 minutes early we’ll prepared after driving for 2 hours from my hotel to get there, I was told to wait an additional 30 minutes after my scheduled time because she wasn’t ready. The branch manager was completely unprofessional. She told me she’s “stretching the interview longer” within 10 minutes of the interview by adding unnecessary conversation because i told her of my drive time. On my drive back, the recruiter called me and told me I got the job after I clear for drug testing. Flash forward to me actually working at the West Orange, NJ branch... I was expected to work 6 days a week (some leave the branch at 7pm some nights)M-S, wear a suit, reach high sales goals, be a banker, be a teller... etc. The job is do-able. But when management is constantly over your shoulder, throwing mini tantrums when things don’t go her way, disrespecting her colleagues... it makes you not want to come to work. After I wasn’t told lunch breaks were 45 minutes not an hour, I had the manager CALL ME WHEN IM OFF THE CLOCK 50 minutes into my break to ask me to come back in. There’s no space. And the fact that management didn’t allow me to continue doing training & jump into"
bad,Tellers were required to meet sales quotas that are unattainable. If you didn’t meet the quota you would receive written warnings even if you had done everything to try to meet those quotas. The pressure they put on employees is over the top.
bad,You were threatened daily of your job being re-evaluated if you did not meet weekly goals. Your were berated and embarrassed in front of employees both face to face and on conference calls. I was in banking for 30 years. I worked at PNC for seven and twenty three at another bank. You are replaceable in a blink of an eye. I was a manager for PNC and refused to treat my employees as poorly rudely and and disrespectfully as I was treated.
bad,"The shifts vary, but regardless you will work 7-10 days in a row. Every other week you get weekends off and then 2 days off during the week. No work life balance."
bad,"The regional management in Cincinnati is only focused on widgets. Not you as an employee and definitely not what's best for your customers. You will be asked to push products on customers that they don't want or need. And don't you dare get sick or have a death in the family. They don't have time for that. Also, be prepared for them to just make up policies out of the blue that are not in writing anywhere and are not used by any other region. P.S your job can be eliminated at any time without warning."
bad,poor place to work no compassion for the employees. enough said. the management was more interested in the numbers than the employees or even the customers...
bad,Ok job but has very high turn over rate and they lack in training you adequately and will terminate the role you are hired for and give a new role without proper notice
bad,"The job was very insecure and a lot of sales pressures. The local management was very uncooperative. To get advise from the management was always discouraged and shrugged off saying "" take responsibility"". Specially for new employee, the help and professional assistance from the local management was none. Too much responsibility with too little training and assistance. The division of responsibility was not fair and evenly shared."
bad,It was an extremely fast paced environment.  the managers walked around behind you with clip boards and marked off things you were doing wrong.  there was never praise just what you did wrong.
bad,"continually increasing workload, little or no raises, paid sinificantly below midpoint of job range for 40 years experience, refused medical coverage. protocol changes with little or no direction"
bad,"No life balance Interference with personal and family life Poor hours and rotations Hideous system for bidding better shifts, holidays etc Lack of occasional absence for year timeframe "
bad,"I was a personal banker for PNC full time. The sales goals are impossible, with even the top performers in my branch struggling to even come close to their numbers. The training is very minimal and management is reluctant to help, even though banking is a highly regulated industry. I was verbally abused by my manager on several occasions but was just told that that’s how she was and to just deal with it. On a typically week, you would be making around 60 cold calls to try and get people to make an appointment to come into the branch. Investments was a big focus for the company but we struggled to find referrals for an FA who would not even speak to the ones we could refer over. I would not recommend starting your banking career with PNC."
bad,"PNC has to of been the worst company that I had ever worked for. When it comes to sales they are worse than Wells Fargo! They will find other ways to push you out if you do not meet your monthly numbers. If you like being treated like nothing more than a number that this is the place for you! When it comes to personal issues, no matter how urgent or serious the issue is, if it does not fit business needs you will not be excused. Take caution when accepting a job within this company."
bad,"Too stressful. The manager I worked for never listen to my side of the story, it's always the Head Teller side.  Come to find out later, my Manager is close to the Head Teller treated him like a son."
bad,The division of PNC I was previously employed is inconsistent w/ new information and not good at all when you're conversing with customer all day in a call center setting. On how they do things especially in IRA Ops in particular is very meager which can be shameful with no defense when explaining policies and practices.
bad,"Toxic Masculinity encouraged, unprofessional environment.  Toxic and highly exploitive culture in general, not a pleasant place to work. Most colleagues expressed feeling stressed, overworked and underpaid."
bad,Manager in NJ my territory PA.  Without more than one hour a week she was telling me where I should go on appointments ect....She could not find her way to my territory.  I should have been assigned to Scranton office.  Glad to be gone!!!
bad,I would never reccemend for anyone to work her high turnover and awful pay. I love my manager and coworkers but the company itself is not great. They micro manage and pressure you to sell. Nothing you do seems good enough
bad,"They fired me for being a Veteran.  Couldn't prove it of course.  But that is the only reason possible as last I heard, they were still using my code."
bad,"Management is poor. I had hard time with the my mentor, whenever I have question he replied with question. It was hard for me to excel since they place people with no mentor and if there is one he isn't helping at least in my case. Long story short, the company wants the workers to make gold from straw. They find reasons to talk down to the employee and refuse to listen when they make a bad decision."
bad,They sell you a good dream but as time goes on you start you feel like you were told a few lies. Management is the biggest problem they all need management classes.
bad,Was extreme lack of communication and accountability. Managers were often not around. I worked open to close almost every day for 3 months with no days off. I wore many hats without any managers appreciating my efforts. Very disappointing.
bad,"rude customers, understaffed. managers dont want to take escalations, escalations dont want to take escalations, spanish line never avail always have to use a 3rd party translator, 10 different programs for different transactions, worst is their strictness with phone time --it is ALL that matters, no time for good needed notes/followupwork/aftercallwork"
bad,"They tell you not to be a product pusher but lay a set number of what they call ""expectations"" on you to meet per quarter, which makes you a product pusher if you want to meet them. If you do not meet these ""expectations"" it affects your ability to move up within the company and also raises. Policies and rules constantly change and there is rarely anyone, including managers, who have the right info to give you. There is a survey system that is random and anonymous that asks customers questions based on your interaction, if they even remember it was you, it is very unfair that also determines if you receive pay raises and your ability to advance in the company. I've received bad surveys from customers due to their bad interactions with a different employee all because they survey is anonymous on who the employee was, and it is almost impossible to come back from a bad survey. The maternity leave is awesome, 16 weeks of 100% pay, which honestly is the only reason I stayed with the company for my final months."
bad,"When I started at PNC, we had no computers, no spreadsheets of performance, and no problems. It was a very fun, exciting place to work. Every night, I watched people who wanted to get the work done. Get it in, get it processed, and get it out again. There was a real teamwork effort to everything."
bad,"I wouldn't recommond to work there. I left after 9 years of service. Pnc does not care about their retail employees. They will make you feel  like a number. Not job security, not trust."
bad,"There is such a high turnover rate that nobody knows what they are doing. If you are a newer employee and have a question and asked multiple people you will get a different answer from each person. Branch reps call in constantly because they get very little training and they don't know what they are doing. Customers are constantly angry because they get incorrect information from employees. The management is extremely poor. The coaches and mentors are even worse. This experience not only has me looking for a new job, but will also have me looking for a new bank."
bad,"Once PNC took over National City in November 2009 and me being a long term top performing manager for 18 years calling off work only 6 days in my life, I met with my new manager for the second time. He let me go because he felt that I lacked management skills."
bad,"Worked here for a short period of time. Management was awful, nobody was willing to help or answer a question. Will never bank with or work for PNC again."
bad,"This company doesn't care about there employees, only care about money and similar to wells fargo they care about selling company products."
bad,"I was terminated the same day I let my manager know I was pregnant. Not only that but the manager treats everyone disrespectfully, and does not follow the policies and procedures you will learn in training. This company is awful"
bad,"This company could care less about its employees .... Not a good place to work if you have bills. I have had a lot of experience and never have had the experience I had working here. Terrible pay, benefits not so great. They offer tuition reimbursement but if you decide to leave  (no matter how long you've been there) they want the money back. Way to help your employees !"
bad,"PNC is one of the lowest paying banks. They need to keep up with other banks and come up with a better competitive pay. Benefits is expensive. Branch managers are great, they care about their workers, but it's the Higher management who don't seem to care about the employees. They are just looking out for themselves. They just care about the numbers. Very product pusher! I don't like it at all."
bad,Moved my way up through the ranks the first twelve years. Total of  fifteen year time span from drive through window teller to my last position as Senior Loan Support Specialist. Very fast paced and often times not enough help with work load. They expected you at times to carry the work load of five people and get the work done in a short time frame and be accurate. No room for advancement in my department. Favoritism shown to often within the department. Employee turn around was tremendous. There was no sense of diversity or inclusion within the financial institution.
bad,"I would not recommend this job to anyone. This company can never keep anyone, because of the low pay and the constant push for sales. Terrible management. I've never seen a company go through employees so quickly!"
bad,The only good thing I can say about PNC is that the customers are awesome!!!! Management is out for themselves. They come and go as they feel say whatever they want to say to staff ( even racist things) and are lazy. I was so happy to leave that place to start my internship.
bad,"DO NOT go to work for PNC Bank in Birmingham, AL in particular the Birmingham West Region it is the most unethical and horrific work environment I've EVER worked for in my 10+years in bank management. The Regional Manager for B'ham West is beyond horrible and is why you will CONSTANTLY see positions open in the Birmingham/Tuscaloosa area, there is always approx. 20%-30% vacancy in positions in the Birmingham West market because of the regional manager and the unethical manner he will force upon employees to manipulate their sales results. DO NOT GO WORK FOR PNC in Birmingham, Alabama....DON'T DO IT!!! PNC Bank is a great company but the Birmingham market operates under its on rules that are wrong."
bad,"I used to work for this place many years ago and was let go for something that everyone does, emailing your co workers.  I recently applied again, thinking that if they could see how much more experience I have and how I have matured in areas that would benefit the company, they might consider hiring me again.  I passed the phone interview and went to a group interview, all in the same day.  Compared to the other applicants, there were at least 10, I had more than enough experience and qualifications for the position of an entry level call center position.  I was declined a position with the generic explanation that I did not fit their needs.  I'm not sure how that could be when I have over ten years experience.  I was actually ok with the decision as I would not want to work the hours they suggested, which was 10-7 and EVERY Saturday.  They make it sound like you are eligible to change those hours after you've worked there, but we all know how that will most likely work out.  Favoritism, I'm sure is how they run this company.  The other thing that people need to be aware of is downsizing, that occurs often and employee over turn.  Why do they have so many positions open?  Because they can't keep their employees."
bad,"did not like working for this company at all this was a place that played to much and management was not good at all coworkers where okay the hardest job for me was just  coming in, there was no enjoyable part of the day but going home for the day"
bad,Management is horrible. Monkeys would do a better job. Employees are not cared about and advancement is nearly impossible. They would rather hire outsiders before advancing hard working employees. Company is more worried about sales than customers.
bad,Worse management ever from the regional to the branch management. HORRIBLE!!!
bad,"Sell everyone an Annuity, sell annuities, sell annuities."
bad,"I was harrassed everyday by new manager. I received three stellar performance reviews from my previous manager. My new manager had a problem I was gay. All of a sudden I became a poor performer. I wasn't going to get a pay raise and when I asked a colleague for more information about a position in her group, he got wind and slandered me. I told employee relations of all the issues I had with him, but they did absolutely nothing. In fact, they continued to support write-ups for poor performance."
bad,"PNC has a history of terminating long term employees and replacing them with less experienced, younger talent which does not cost them as much for benefits and salary. The company cares more about its bottom line than employees. Management does not live up to the values that they preach."
bad,My co workers were a good group of people. Management for the most part was good. Beware that the video cameras are not only there to watch customers but to also use against the employees if a certain person in HR feels you have done something wrong. They use them against the employees for minor infractions and can get rid someone.
bad,They set u up for failure. They put me in a bank branch with employees failing n they knew it. They asked me to weed them out n when I did the employees Fabricated things n they disciplined me for doing what they ask me to do
bad,"Universal banker =teller work all day, yet expects you to make calls and achive goals. "
bad,Store manager has no knowledge of how to run a team . Which makes this work environment poor. She expects to highly of everyone making everyone feel like they are not capable of doing their job accurately.
bad,"The training is severely lacking, the management at the branch I worked in was unable to perform the basic necessities of the job, due to having zero banking experience when hired."
bad,Management was weak and inconsistent.  After 33 years you would think that you would have some value with the company but that is not the case at all.  They just don’t care about their employees one bit.  Total contradiction of the companies mission statement and what they say their values are.  Employees are treated very different and very unfairly.  The benefits package is the only good thing that I can say good about the company.
bad,I found the management to be a closed set of people that hogged the limelight and never give credit to their teams. It looks like every person is for himself and intense power struggle is in play most of the time.
bad,"Coming from a larger financial institution, PNC falls behind in technology and training. There is no guided training and there are countless systems that should be consolidated into one go ease."
bad,"If you like selling all the time and to make your salary then you should work there. However, being the mascot was really fun and each week there was a new even you were to go to."
bad,"Bad experience . High turnover. Stressful. Not a good place to work, I prefer my bank I wouldn’t want to be a customer at this bank as they push sales sales sales and it’s just not healthy in a bank setting, if the tellers are hounding the customers for more features and stuff they don’t need."
bad,Pnc states the strive on work/ life balance. However this wasn't the case when the branch manager forged my name on documents stamped by his medallion stamp. They constantly put u down and want more and more out of you. Nothing is ever enough. Would never recommend PNC.
bad,"Job environment was good at first. "
bad,"If you take this job be prepared to work all the time. If you like to go out and enjoy youy weekend, this is not the job for you. You will be working pretty much every weekend except one."
bad,Awful. Caustic work environment.  Turnover off chart. No matter which state you work in you will hear the same horror studies. If you don't mind hearng 50 times a day how bad you suck you will like it here. I hope you don't mind endless buearocracy.
bad,"Very strict with referrals and a tough job for tellers. Handling large amounts of cash can be very stressful, and with good management PNC is a good bank to work for."
bad,"Worked in the Home Lending Center and it ended up being a nightmare. Volume was down significantly, resulting in the majority of LOs not hitting tier targets, thus leading to not making any money. There is likely going to be any change to the compensation plan to accurately reflect how much each loan officer is funding. It is hard to make a decent living off a low salary and very low commission. "
bad,poor management from and high turn-over due to sr management down to sales.  85%+ turn over rate while I was working there and I hope they have since changed their way
bad,"Rushed training, management is cutthroat. If your really good on the phones in the first day of training outside of the classroom they keep you, otherwise forget ever moving into the role of Customer Service Representative.  The Customer Service Management claim they are experts in whether your going to be bad or good on the phones the first day and if you are slow learning the 15-20 screens you need to know, they cut you immediately. Also you can't get the vacations you asked for because your last in line so new training classes are not going to get requested time off. They also ask you to open a new bank account one week into classroom trading, don't do it. If they cut you, close the account immediately. Also there is no accountability at the whole company as there is no complaint resolution, except for a call center. If you have a problem with management or they treat you unfairly expect more of the same as upper management rubber stamps lower management decisions. Not a good company to work for."
bad,I never got the feeling that anyone actually knew what they were supposed to be doing at PNC. Not sure if this is because the constant cost cutting or because of the mergers of 08-09. This made most people stressed out. The benefits and vacation were pretty good.
bad,"no Direction or management and very high level of stress!!! I loved my customers and the people i worked with but the management was not impressive, they would not allow us to leave our phones to go to the bathrooms or take breaks unless it was a scheduled lunch!"
bad,"In my time working at PNC bank I had a lot of ups and down. Do I recommend working for this company? If you're ok with unqualified management, stressful pressure to meet referral goals (even though it's like high school with the undermining) and lack of overall employee engagement and focus than its paradise for you but the environment in which I worked was unbearable (they claim to be customer service oriented and not sales but it's a hypocritical delusion).There was drama every week, a lot of favoritism and management:employee out of-work-relationships. Poor communication between management and poor handling of day to day issues. Maybe I'm just one of the few that slipped through the cracks but I most definitely do not recommend anyone with morals to work for this company."
bad,I was hired to manage a team of outside sales associates.  We were given three days of training and told to secure 100 checking accounts a month for a company that has less the 1 percent market share in Orlando.  Unrealistic goals and expectations combined with poor training and guidance didn't make for a good experience.
bad,Good place to work if you have a management that could treat people with respect instead of having favorites.
bad,"Because of massive understaffing, they will hire you in at PT and then inform you that your schedule is ""subject to change"" - but you will not receive FT bonus payouts, FT benefits, or FT vacation perks. They DO NOT work with schedules, will not accommodate you if you have school, kids, etc. In my experience, PNC was not forthcoming about this information, which had they been during the time of my interview I would have saved myself and them some time and not taken the job. They are not upfront and honest about how they will work you like a FT employee even though you accepted a PT position."
bad,"Originally viewed as a bank teller position with some sales. Highly aggressive direct sales position that was not as described. As an in store sales associate, you were required to walk around grocery store and try to get people to open up accounts/ credit cards. Management was fairly new and didn't offer support. Their main response was ""what can I do to help you get more customers?"" Bank was very short staffed and you are often found alone with little to no support should issues arise when you are new."
bad,"For 2 years I have been trying to be strictly part time on a set schedule to make achieving the work/life balance PNC says they care so much about a little bit easier. It hasn’t worked so far. Managers either micromanage or are so hands off they don’t notice the problems or worse, they do both. You will be told repeatedly that they don’t have the staffing available to make sure you leave on time but they have the staffing to send people to other branches..."
bad,Management is horrible. No compassion. Not fair. Work life balance there is none. Terrible work environment. The pay & insurance are what keeps me there.
bad,"I liked being a teller, however PNC forces tellers to push products on every single customer, even those you would see ever day.  Tellers should be able to provide customer service, not pushing products the customers don't ask for or want.  To this day I have flashback nightmares of my manager criticizing our work. For this they paid a full time teller 9$ an hour. Benefits were good, as they should be at a large company.   Every day we had a morning meeting on performance, what to push to customers, and Pnc calls customers for feedback on employee performance and if you got less than 5 out of 5 you were not doing good enough.  Also, as a teller, we had to cold call customers after work periodically to sell them financial services."
bad,"The only real qualification for management is seniority. Because the  majority of them have limited skills, all good people, being managed by them, leave.  So the people who stick around and get seniority, and are the next generation of management, are pretty lackluster.  Truly capable technical people are too valuable to be allowed to leave the legacy apps they have patched repeatedly and are left in place."
bad,The company dose not give annual raises unless your perfect they never promote from with in. They don't care about their employees I was verbally abused by my trainer and was told that's just how she is and to deal with it
bad,Started off ok then after being there 3 years was let go because of a “procedure violation” but really got fired because the manager didn’t like me...
bad,"There is not a good system of management. Most of the managers expect you to read their minds and their is no clear instructions given. Makes for a very difficult place to work. Also, fo the amount of traffic in the branches, sales goals are unreasonable for bonuses."
bad,when you go to train it is an awesome experience for the first 2 weeks but when you get in the branch it derails quickly. my teller supervisor had an attitude would not help with me with questions even though i had never been in this environment  before.  she was friends with many of our customers on social media and was dating the guy who came to take the shred every week.  everyone knew her business and it was embarrassing to say the least. I told the DM but to my knowledge nothing was done.
bad,Everyone was out for themselves.  You got little support from management and they were always more worried about how they looked as opposed to helping associates do their jobs well.
bad,"They act like they care about the customers, but all they want are sales. They concentrate on the PNC conversation which centers around clients finances. The goal of this conversation is to get clients to move over their investments to PNC or to sell them a financial service that isn't necessarily needed."
bad,"Very stressful job, regional manager requires us to force sales upon customers daily, always short staffed, huge turn over because people don't want to work in the stress."
bad,Management does not support their employees to keep producing for the team. There are income gaps and lack of stretch opportunities offered to employees.
bad,If you do not meet your goals then you will be written up. It is very stressful when the pressure is on you to meet the companies quota. You do not want to harass customers and force them into loans and credit cards if they do not want it. the company doesn't care. they want accounts opened and loans approved.
bad,Massive turn over will fire employees because they do not meet the cares model. We had over twenty people to start there are two people left.
bad,"they are trying to get rid of people working in the bank."
bad,laid off after 10 1/2 years without so much as a goodbye from senior management
bad,Terrible place to work.  They do not care about the employees at all.  It is all about the numbers.  They feel that their brand is so strong that people will just flock to be a part of the bank.  Pressure galore.  PNC bank is bad about paying people enough for all the responsibility they have.
bad,"NOT PLEASANT WORK ENVIRONMENT I didn't care for their management team i didn't trust them very petty,sneaky and underhanded.Future management training should be required for managers just don't give someone a job to fill a vacany."
bad,"I truly enjoyed my job and I planned to retire from PNC Bank when the time came. I supported two Regional Managers while supporting 30 banking offices in order to obtain goals and maintain proper staff. I prepared and collected numerous reports, completed all human resource functions, followed-up on all training for every employee in the 30 branches and supported staffing issues. I learned much about the banking industry and the changes over the last 39 years. I always enjoyed my co-workers because I felt like I was helping each branch achieve goals and that was the most enjoyable part of my job. The hardest part was always having time to get everything completed in an 8 hour day. I have always been one to want everything completed before going home and some days that was not possible."
bad,PNC Bank as a whole may have been a good place to work but my branch had a lot of moral issues I did not agree with.
bad,"A good place to work. It is a mass production shop. $3,000,000 and under"
bad,This company has flexiable hours and days. August of last year my days were changed without consulting me. We have employe recognition days. Spotlight awards are giving to employees for making quanity for the month and no absences.
bad,They have a very “take ownership” attitude so you can’t say anything along the lines of “it’s our/PNCs policy”. Your basically getting berated all of the time by customers or managers who want you to sell even though you aren’t in sales.
bad,"the whole company was awful"
bad,Empty promises. Upper Management is a nightmare.. Need big changes. Starts at the top.. HR is not for the employees rather works to get people out for any reason.
bad,"They’re all over the place, no one knows what’s going on within the company. I enjoyed my first 3 years but it’s gone downhill. I wish they would value their employees."
bad,"PNC's work environment was fun. However, the management and the rules made it difficult to work there. The managers and customers were not bad but again, the rules and management caused a problem."
bad,"I worked for PNC a little over 2 years. In the first 6 months I could tell the managements was trash. When I took a dif position I was targeted to get fired. My cases were being audited when no one else on the team was. All of my mis steps were brought to light, until they found something that could get me fired. My last paycheck was stolen from PNC as they made up some  bogus reason as to why they docked my pay."
bad,"lack of communication, bad management, over working hours with no outcome, great benefits. empty promises about next positions. lack of keeping employees"
bad,the job was very cut throat every man for themselves. they only looked out for management and treatly the tellers as if they were secondly when the clients met with us first. I felt very little working for them.
bad,I worked for this company and have to say horrible experience I wasn't with the company a month before being fired the manager who hired me quit while I was in training and when the new manager came in she fired me I wouldn't work for PNC in Birmingham Alabama period you've been warned
bad,"I worked here for roughly a year and a half, it was a good place to work at first then it became too stressful because of the short staff."
bad,"If you are young and innovative with ideas you might not want to work here. Management is full of individuals with a superiority complex and will take credit for every good idea you have. You merely become a puppet to their agenda. If you like to go to work and keep to yourself and just maintain the flow that becomes short lived as some like to stir the pot. It's a great bank but human resources needs to step in at some point and realize how much talent is being lost. The culture amongst non exempt employees is phenomenal, the best I have ever seen. The bank president is an everyday guy that shares his wealth of knowledge, just wish he weeded out the wolves in sheep's clothing."
bad,"Typically my day begins by opening the branch, going over our plans for the day with each other so we know who's doing what, communication.  From there my day consists of calling clients, assisting clients who visit the branch, doing outreach events during the day for the community."
bad,I get it banking is not what it used to be 5-15 years ago. I myself am about to pick up what will be my third job while I am still employed there to finish a degree I started to be eligible for better opportunity if not there the next company. All our incoming staff is just about collecting a paycheck and those of us sales driven/client dedicated employees have our hard work overlooked and ignored by management for  the slackers because of “special relationships “ they have with management even though they make very little beneficial contributions. Hostile work environments are thick in my side of DC west
bad,It was fun at first getting into a new field but clientele is very difficult to deal with a lot of fraud is attempted at this location and it all falls on you. You go home dreading to come back scared of messing up. there is a lot of pressure. half the people that have started there from when i was last there are gone or fired.
bad,"If you’re not familiar with having sales goals, this is not the company for you. The micromanage is unbelievably insane, and upper management talks down on employees. Not to mention the pay is far from great. If your supporting a family this job will not pay enough."
bad,"PNC will pay you a mid level wage as their a mid level bank. Their systems were antiquated when I worked there and it made it hard to do the job.  My experience here was unpleasant and I personally wouldn't recommend this organization from a retail banker perspective.  I was here for 12 months and witnessed too many mid level managers leave either on their own accord or they were let go due to reorganization.  Perhaps its changed since then, I hope so."
bad,No I decline to answer questions about PNC Bank at this time. I enjoyed my role at the company but overall there were and are quite a bit of things I would change.
bad,"For the most part, the management team is horrible. No other words to describe. When you have the opportunity to have a good manager typically they are beat down and tired."
bad,"In the beginning, as always, everything seemed to be okay. My manager was OK but was not the best. Pretty much let us do whatever we want. Since there was a lack of staff, you find yourself doing everyone job. My manager was let go and PNC had us with no manager for 6 months. IT'S NOT OKAY! This caused us to go through many inconveniences and even jeopardize our career in banking. I had to quit because the regional manager had everything controlled and didn't care about the well being of the employees. She only cared about her numbers. Of course every region is different but keep this in mind when applying."
bad,"If you enjoy delivering sales pitches to non relevant transactions than this is the place for you. If you enjoy an environment where “success” is cramming products down customers throats, then this is for you. If you can back an employer for allowing unethical sales (and promoting and praising such employees) than PNC is for you. Management was toxic and not engaged. Career Development? Not unless you reached an unattainable amount of goals and were basically a favorite. The whole company is a joke. Don’t waste your time."
bad,"First day there supvervisor immediately was very rude, ignorant and very unprofessional. The atmosphere was noticeably tense when she was around, the other supvervisor there was very pleasant and professional. The pay was good. I cant say much about the benefits since i was only there for a few days before leaving. This was the job i wanted but I refused to work in such a hostile environment. Wouldn't mind going back if the management was different."
bad,"Based on some of the techniques within the business, the business need to focus on the structure of the staff and not too much on the customers, employees have a family also and would need a day off to take care of their personal issues."
bad,"They do not have their employee's backs. The customer is always right. You can explain policy and procedure till you're blue in the face, have the customer ask to speak to a supervisor who explains the same thing you did, and you're in trouble because they wanted to hear it from a supervisor. One of the worst jobs I've ever had."
bad,"PNC maintains that it cares for it's employees, when all it really cares about is sales, sales, sales. They push their employees to the point of burn out, then look for reasons to terminate your employment. PNC does not take into account local management opinions, or knowledge of their direct employees performance. When they want to fire someone, they do it regardless of your immediate supervisor's opinion. Corporate Employee Relations ""tells"" Managers what to do in matters of employee terminations. It is not a ""collaboration"" as they claim. Those decisions come from a far away state, from a corporate level, from people who know  nothing about you personally, or professionally."
bad,"While I am at PNC bank it is teaching me the value of people. I service all ethics and many different cultures. The Branch I work at is a steady pace but always busy on the 1st and 3rd. The Pay could be more for the work we do but the benefits help balance that out. I learned to identify false checks, suspicious deposits, and robbery patterns. Our branch was one of few that passed the yearly audit, which I was proud. I had the chance to do teller work as well, but mostly I was a banker"

bad,The experience was very unpleasant. The salary was poor. There was no real appreciation hard work. I left the company after three years.
bad,PNC Bank is an okay job.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working along with my colleagues and learning from them.  Management could diffidently be better in my opinion.
bad,good company to learn about banking life. overall very solid employment and much opportunity for improvement and self growth
bad,Employees get very little consideration. This company is ALL about numbers. Favoritism is a big factor in the day to day.
bad,"chasing down data alone"
bad,"I didn't make it past the 8 week training... If you want to call it training It was pretty much a joke. The people training in the ""bull pen"" don't even know what they are doing. They claim they want people to be compassionate yet in every phone call there is literally 20 things you must get out or you fail QA. No wonder the turn over rate is ridiculous.  This was the worst experience I've ever had at a job."
bad,"I was a Financial Sales Consultant typical day would handling customers on platform side of the branch. Had really high sales goals which I was able to achieve."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job was getting people in accounts that best suited their needs."
bad,Helping clients to obtain financing to purchase a new home or refinance existing mortgage.
bad,I really did not like working here. The branch I worked at was very busy because of the businesses in the area. I typical come in and get my cash box. I worked in the drive thru so it would be at least 3 cars waiting for me. I learned that I didn't like counting money as much as I thought I did. My coworkers was really nice. Most of us got along. My manager was pretty cool as well but definitely was about business first.
bad,PNC is a good place to work. It offers great benefits and flexible schedule. I was able to learn so many thing in just few months.
bad,"salaries are not bad, the commission is not good and the working environment is not stable at all, always changes in management. very sales and product pushy"
bad,"Typical days were long, learned a lot, management changes, this is upsetting to be forced to write about a typical day, what I've learned, management workplace culture"
bad,"VERY poor management!"
bad,I learned how to do customer service were people would bring back things or do returns. The hardest part of the job was communication. I enjoyed this job because of the people I made friends there.
bad,PNC does not care about their employees.  It is a toxic work environment where managers only care about their own numbers and will fire any one that does not help them advance their career.
bad,")))))))))))))))))) None ))))))))))))))))))))"
bad,horrible experience with supervisor and management. the training to begin with is horrible. also they expect you to learn everything that the bank offers on your own with little or no help. i was in a predominant white area and have never been treated as bad as when i worked here. not only by customers but by my supervisor. the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to speak to a sincere customer and escaping from the drama of the workplace. hardest part of the job was maintaing a professional attitude in this work environment.
bad,This was just short term. Basically I went in to the banks with my other team members and replaced the old towers with new updated towers.
bad,Ok place to work bad shift room for advancement changes all the time no more in office only work from home must have private space for work where door can lock
bad,"Job demands became unhealthy working 16 hour days consistently with lots of technology issues and a command and control managment style. Management did not know how to value and bring out the best in staff.  Instead, staff feared senior management."
bad,PNC offers on line training courses.  Promotion is very unlikely depending on the department you are in.  Benefits could be better for the monthly premium you pay.  Once you are displaced or laid off very seldom do you get hire back within a year.  Recruiter assigned to assist with the lay off and help placement is a joke. No assistance at all.   Departments in other areas claim they promote within.  No offers once you are displaced. Bank is known to mass hire for projects and lay-off after projects are done.
bad,"Pros:"
bad,Was a good place until changes in leadership.  There is a lot of talk about taking care of the client and employee but somewhere from the top down it was lost.
bad,"The operations specialist/associate position was extremely stressful!! I was being micromanaged everyday. It is a fast paced production environment and it would be more beneficial if the managers didn’t hover over you while you’re working it’s ridiculous. I would’ve preferred the ability to focus on doing my job. If you enjoy stress, your breaks and bathroom breaks timed to the last second, and micromanagement this job is for you! I feel so much better now that I no longer work there."
bad,Work load to high and not enough people to cover shifts and every thing has to be done like yesterday in this environment.  everything is in high demand and upper management dont care about new Ideal and technology that is out there. they always shut down your ideals for in this company to grow and evolve. security is so high you cant work.
bad,"PNC Bank is a huge company with grand ideas on employment engagement and work-life balance. Having been employed with a bank that was acquired thru merger into PNC Bank, there was constant struggle in communications and creating synergies among the teams. Micro-managing was a constant issue with my group and leadership was a nightmare with inconsistencies in decision making and collaboration."
bad,Forced sales quotas made this job miserable. I'm not a sales person and the people I spoke with had no desire to hear a sales pitch when they were just trying to do their banking.
bad,"The first 3 1/2 years I spent at PNC, it was like a dream job!"
bad,"The goals they have given to tellers are insane and completely unachievable. Even if you miraculously it the minimum requirements to earn incentives and keep your job, it won't be recognized and no matter what you do it'll never be enough."
bad,management sucks and employees there are childish and very picky ... pay is very low part time workers does not get benefits ..workers are childish just like management
bad,"They change your entire job"
bad,"There is no structure in this Bank. They give you a low base pay, but promise you will make 4-10,000 a quarter in incentives.  You don't.  And nobody can tell you how the revenue credit incentives really work, even when people exceed goal with them they don't know how they did it to replicate it each month. I well exceeded my individual and branch production goals but it didn't correlate into revenue credit incentives.  Most bankers get 700 dollars a quarter after taxes. The turnover is insane, the manager that hired me quit before I got done with training, we went through 3 in a year,  I had 20 people in my training class,  only 3 of us made it there longer than 6 months. If you have health issues and get approved for Fmla, they try to find little things to let you go for. I have worked in 3 banks, I've never been at a company for less than 3 years, it was a struggle staying here a year and a half."
bad,"I don't have anything bad to say about any company, However, I also have nothing good to say about this one. The management seems to be very negative. Instead of telling us ""you should know this"" the managers should have pointed us all in the right direction, hence the reason there is only 2 out of the 10 people left from training. Training platform was very poorly setup. Without support from our managers  it was hard to succeed. a lot of us did not wait around for that to happen. Great location but a bad group of  mentally unstable people who just do happened to become  managers."
bad,Careful with accepting offers here. Ask for past history of incentives at branch you will be working at. Very misleading.
bad,"•	Manage Reconciliation of SWIFT and Spreadsheet"
bad,"I transferred from a PNC customer care center to a branch location in another state! I have been in my new environment for a very short time (1 month) and can already feel the pressure of management for sales production. Although the morale of the employees is very low at the customer care center, outbound sales level...the morale of the employees at the branch level is extremely low. There is a severe disconnect between service partners within the company (branch/experiential team). "
bad,A typical day included assisting 9 bank branches with their mortgage clients.  I had to travel everyday to 4 out of 5 branches daily.  Taking applications only occurred after conducting a needs analysis/interview with the client. I had to review what situation the client was in and determine their needs.  If a client was looking for a prequalification certificate this was taken care of accordingly.  I loved my position as this point of contact for my branches but the compensation was a major issue.  Our operations team had its challenges and was undergoing renovations so it took its toll on our efforts.   The most difficult part of this position is not having a voice within the company and essentially being asked for more and more business and not successfully closing the current business.  I had excellent relationships with my branch partners because I made sure I communicated daily with them and reported updates.  I definitely enjoyed the position and the people.  The compensation is not where it needs to be for the amount of work that is given.
bad,"I did not like going to work. I worked part time as a teller and I felt as if they did not like me. This particular branch, the women were very snobby!!! The manager hardly ever cracked a smile and alot of two face going on daily. Very unpleasent place to be, even part time. :("
bad,operations specialist(former employee) not a nice place to work for. they treat you like you a five year old.. menagement think only of them selfs. they would sell you down the river .just so they could get a head.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! lol and that does not mean lots of luck
bad,Co workers  are fabulous. Upper management  doesn't  care about employees. Turn over is consistent. Think  twice about  applying..Policies prevent you  from helping people.
bad,"All smoke and mirrors. Bank has exellent culture on paper but does not live by vision.  Employee relations is a joke. It took wayyyy to long to remove someone who caused many issues in the work place including targeting, retaliation and bullying..making the office toxic and unpleasant."
bad,"From the CEO down to departmental managers, the leadership team at PNC is a disorganized disgruntled mess that does NOT care about the non-salaried employees."
bad,"PNC starts off great, leaves you with high hopes for your future. You do pretty intense training but it is basically just how to use the extremely out of date software. After training, you are expected to know the ins and out of banking. No real training on the things you deal with day to day.  Schedule changes daily and although you are told you have to work 1 Saturday a month, you end up working 3 if not 4. Upper management and HR is useless."
bad,"In my personal experience I advise anyone who has an interest in working for this company to do your best to find a job downtown. The branch managers are incompetent and will fire anyone or throw you under the bus if it saves themselves. While I’ve heard nothing but great things in other departments, working in a branch, specifically with an unprofessional, uneducated manager where I worked  will only cause loathing of the company."
bad,"Management is engrained in the tactical day to day operations and has no vision or strategy.  Management speaks of work/life balance as something that will come in the years to come if we work hard today.  It takes 4-5 months to get an approved work effort approved to begin.  So after getting approval, you have another 4-5 months of getting approvals before you can begin."
bad,"Pay is lower than the industry.  Horrible management. Open environment was forced without consulting teams or a consulting firm leads to everyone getting sick. No privacy. Lockers like you are 12. "
bad,"The title says it all. I am over skilled and overworked for no advancement opportunities without sacrificing my ethical standards. I was consistently used as a manager when convenient for the company without the requisite pay, and continually denied advancement due to honest discourse."
bad,"It has been almost 10 years since I worked for PNC Bank and yet I still remember how unhappy I was there. The management was incompetent and often times was mean. In the end PNC was just another bank looking to make a profit off of it's members."
bad,I worked for PNC Bank through the temp agency Aerotek. I worked on a project for 3 months and was told I would have my contract extended. The project was extended and rescinded due to lack of work.
bad,"The manager was an senior manager stuck in their ways.  Referred to the Administrative Assistant as ""Secretary"".    At the risk of sounding sour, It was a great place to work unless you had to communicate with the boss.  There were RARELY EVER positive conversations.  Just putting out fires or helping them of a jam because they didn't want to take the time to do their job.  The culture was good except for the management...  Best part of the day was leaving.  The manager also choose to ignore the enormous leadership development initiative set forth by our company leader.  ""Strange"" to say the least.  I believe it was looked upon as time not well spent so it DID NOT happen.  "
bad,The staff was always involved in contests for bonuses or recognition. They were very mean to each other and would purposely steal each other's accounts and sales.
bad,Very pushy on sales goals and speaking in a corporate way. Really gave no room for personality. Were never quite pleased with production. Could lose job at any moment from any number of mistakes.
bad,"This place is a sink or swim type of job.  There is NO training that actually teaches anyone how to do their job.  Because everything is so numbers driven, co-workers can't/won't make time to help new people out, and those who do are punished with poor performance ratings. Suggestions for improvement are ignored. Upper management is too busy having meetings about the meetings they have to actually take time to talk to their ""minions"" to find out what is happening in the office and how they can help make the workplace a better environment.  Quarterly financials talk about how much the bank is making, but at year end review they can't afford to give their employees raises. Employees feel like they are just numbers and not truly appreciated.  The occasional lunch and snacks do not make up for all of the negativity in the division."
bad,"Just conduting basic banking transactions. deposits, withdrawals, cashing checks, making money orders and bank checks, answering phones and have the best customer service. Lobby engagement as well."
bad,"Always being ""coached"" and pushed to SELL. Goals are unrealistic. Plan to work overtime and 6 days a week. Always understaffed and the managers rarely work extra hours, especially Saturdays. No written warnings if you make a mistake, they just fire you on Friday afternoon."
bad,The recruiting is very misleading. Management is clueless. Only cares about production. Expectations of the job extremely out weighs the compensation.
bad,"I was working here during the transfer from National City to PNC, it was stressful time for everyone. I imagine now that its been a couple of years things are better."
bad,"Working there was horrible. I never had been so stressed in my life. You are a machine to them and they don't care. You have to work forced overtime which they have the right to take back. If you live close to their I guess that wouldn't be a problem but if you commute back and forth from the city it can be quite time consuming. They are a 24/7 operation yet there is no flexibility. Everyone talks about everyone and the only way to move up is to best friends with a supervisor or manager. Turnover was high when I was there at about 35%, I left three years ago and I 've heard its higher than that. As people come in the door people are going out."
bad,"Not an employee first company as they strive to be. Upper leadership is lacking as well as pay and opportunities for growth, this is regardless of your skill set"
bad,"It's all about sales. The company speaks about financial well being like they are going to change the customers life, but it really all about driving sales. "
bad,"Time management wasn't the greatest, definitely have gone through many struggles such as staffing but somehow it was overcome with great sacrifices. Sometimes you will not eat lunch at the same time everyday or not at all. Breaks will vary as well and your clock out time can change from time to time due to branch meetings, or branch audits due to over or short in a teller's drawer. Some branches do go out of their way to celebrate birthdays which I enjoyed but got my birth day wrong (I'm November and somehow they got September.) The hardest part of my job is working the teller supervisor position and not getting compensated for it and not asked to take the position when it was open."
bad,"Great customers but a typical day at work can be horrible depending on the type of day your manager is having. Management should be the examples they wish to see in their employees. Too many Indians, not enough Chiefs. I've learned the art of multitasking. Great customers though..."
bad,"PNC is notorious for underpaying their employees.  The average education level of my department is a GED.  I have a Masters and do not get paid equally.  The management team creates a glass ceiling and an exclusionary environment.  Out of 6 individuals with Masters, there will only be one individual left after I leave."
bad,I was surprised that the management was not helpful. New employees were not trained by management. New Employees forced to sink or swim. Turnover rate was extremely high!!! Not a good experience with this employer.
bad,"Staff is rude, no advancements, never get days off, I felt used and never appreciated. They also make you feel unintelligent."
bad,"I usually never review anything unless I am extremely satisfied or extremely disappointed. It is very unfortunate to say, that this is by far the worst company I have ever worked for. I have never felt so humiliated, discriminated against, and out of place with any other employer in my past. The lack of open-mindedness and education in the environment are clearly a big issue and greatly contribute to the high level of unprofessionalism observed within the retail banking sector. None of the promises I was made in the beginning of my career ever became a reality, and it did not take long to realize that the only reason I was hired was because they needed bodies, not because they valued my experience, skills, and me as an employee. I am beyond disappointed and would not recommend to anyone with education beyond high school level."
bad,The company does not pay a living wage ( check Salaries for yourself  before applying) . Lots of hard work for not much compensation. Company promoted an unqualified minority to keep from having an all white management staff . Not a good company for minorities especially African Americans.
bad,"Customer's are great!! Working here has given me great customer service skills but not much else. Management is disorganized and unreliable. Constantly short handed. The hardest part of the job is meeting the demands of corporate while trying to perform daily functions. Unrealistic expectations for tellers especially when there is never enough employees to help with tasks at hands. Consistently expected to handle tasks that management is supposed to handle. Always changing policies, employees DO NOT stay long, get there experience then go to another bank with less drama!!"
bad,Very bureaucratic levels of management.  The only way to succeed is to step on others.  No real growth potential.  Job availability depending on the geographical location.  The closer you are to Pittsburgh the better your chances.
bad,Expectations are too high. Many turn overs and change is constants. Manager is okay. Co-workers are fine but its always new people.
bad,"Management is inconsistent. Each branch is ran completely different. Part timers are treated less important. As a part timer you have no sick or personal days and no vacation until 1 year. If your child is sick you must have a back up plan, if your back up isn't available you must have a back up plan for that back up plan, otherwise you're screwed. "
bad,"First of all, the hours I was hired to work was not what I was given once I started.   Also, the teller supervisor either ignored my questions or pretended not to hear me or was annoyed when I asked for help.  It was very confusing due to the fact that everyone that worked here had a different way of doing the job therefore I never understood what was correct and what was not.  Don't work here."
bad,"The management would implement goals that were unrealistic due to ALWAYS being short staffed! Once, we surpassed our goal for checking accounts causing the region to exceed their goal and the regional manager said since it was student accounts it would not be profitable accounts; instead of praising us for our hard work! PNC as a company looks at each employee as a number. You are not a valued person and even when you go over and beyond sacrificing time with your family it will not be recognized or even appreciated. PNC does initially make you think your opinion counts due to employee surveys, but if you don't give your branch or manager good scores you are punished. If you are thinking about working with this company DON'T! You will be happier somewhere else!!"
bad,DO NOT apply for the Libertyville location. Try anywhere else. Branch Manager there is a headcase and messes with you mentally on a daily basis. I worked there for under six months due to this. He waits for the slightest slip up and then gets you fired by HR. Save yourself and do not apply for this position at Libertyville.
bad,As an employee of PNC Bank I have witnessed many unethical practices and downright crumby treatment of non-management employees. PNC has little to offer and can and will take that from you as well. No safety net. No security.
bad,No repeat of what you have done also they try to laid you off to get others to pay them less.
bad,"I go to work every day, working accounts that are delinquent. It's the same boring job, over and over again. This job was decent when I was working on my MBA but now that I've graduated, I dread coming to work every day."
bad,Unprofessional management and work environment. Worked in call center.
bad,Made promises of advancement that never materialized.  Bonuses never fulfilled.  No regular schedule from week to week.  Work 6 days a week but only get paid for 5 - no overtime allowed.
bad,"I interviewed for a completely different job.  While the title and description remained the same after I was hired, the actual job itself was entirely different than what I was lead to believe.  If I had known beforehand what I was going to be doing, I never would have accepted the position."
bad,On your own for training and fellow employees were to busy to help! you had and old manual and that is what you had to reference. Management had no time for meetings or getting to gethter weekly.
bad,The Wealth Management team is a joke. They charge clients at least 30bps more than the competition and then wonder why clients leave. The only time they do a book of business review with Wealth Mgt clients is when the client is threatening to leave or the client has died and they are trying to retain the beneficiaries of the deceased's estate. RM last an average of 18 months. Married SVPs have extra marital affairs with subordinates and HR resources does nothing about it. No one ever meets or even has a clue as to who their HR reps are. Get some experience here and then go sell it to a real Wealth Mgt firm.
bad,"Worst job I've ever had. If it were up to me, I'd tell the entire world to be careful when trying to get a job here. I wonder how they're still in business to be honest."
bad,"They claim to be about client relationships but really all they care about are stockholder profits.  They don't "
bad,"I work in the asset management clearing department. I do my work unsupervised and can work from home if needed.  There is an internal job sight for other positions at PNC, however the descriptions are so vague you don't know what you're actually applying to do.  Even when you finally get an interview, there isn't much clarity around what the job is. Management feels it isn't their job to be able to help their employees when they are overwhelmed or need help.  There is no work life balance because you're expected to work until the daily work is finished even if it takes 10 hours that day but management leaves at 2pm.  You only start to get help when management feels they look bad.  Working in the branch was much better than working in their back office."
bad,Company offers a good pay grade for what seems like an easy job. Literally just getting yelled at all day about things that policy won’t let you fix for them. Stuck in one position for a year before you can move to a different area. Managers never want to help with anything.
bad,"Employed 3 years, wasn’t trying to make career of it. pay was ok at first . Based on your yearly performance you may get a raise here and there but they are the lowest paying banks. It’s all about politics with this company. Atleast the Baltimore region that is. you won’t advance unless you sucker up to the big wigs and Exceed sale goals. They definitely are all about the numbers. forget the effort . Overall the managers suck. Yes they are under a lot of pressure but majority of them aren’t qualified. Managers don’t know how to be respectful or simple duties of the job but are hired but then leave or fired not to long after. The benefits are ok, not for if you have a big family. They definitely are conniving. Don’t trust anyone . If the company feels like your time has come to an end or whatever the case they will find something to terminate you over, no warning or anything. Doesn’t matter how long you have been there or sales or good employee. A lot of secretive unexplainable things will happen and nothing you can do. All they care about is revenue. And give you a little tiny raise to make up for treating you like nothing. Personal life is out the Question. There would be some that would work every day and weekend. But Ofcourse not allowed overtime. Job was very draining and led a lot of people to depression or quitting. Definitely do not stay longer than 1 or 2 yrs if you wanna maintain your sanity. Get the training and leave as soon as you can, preferably another bank . They’ll pay more and be happy you’re already experienced."
bad,"There is so much to say about my experience with this company but to sum it up.  The company does not set you up for success at all.  I personally did succeed but at the cost of my health physically and mentally. The training does absolutely nothing to prepare you for the actually job.  The 1-2 week training basically just shows you the systems you will be working with. THATS IT.  For the 3 years I was there management changed the processes about twice a month; sometimes more. I am all for being flexible with change but it was just ridiculous after a while. On top of it they want you to keep up with every wishy washy change they made and reprimand you for every mistake. Every day I felt like I may lose my job if I'm not perfect. The company also changed the incentive structure every year to make it more difficult to bonus. I was a Processor and there were just so many things outside out control, but we got blamed for every thing that happened.  I would never recommend anyone work here and I will never work for them again. I honestly feel the company as a whole did not care about their customers and every decision they made was a guess.  they have all these kind of special projects testing out new processes or systems but when it comes down to implementing real feed back they don't listen to the people who actually do the job every day. Also, as an employee so many managers have favorites."
bad,"The first two months I had a great manager that always took care of his employees and had a fair schedule for everybody. After that manager left the bank had at least 5 different managers for like a year."
bad,PNC is a not a good place to bank nor is it a good place to be employed.  they changed there systems over for their loans and caused all kinds of complications with their customers. the higher ups were not available lots of management took vacation at that time and had the Escalations and Loans teams work through the issue.  The Training for the new program was not adequate and no one knew what to do.  It took months to try and get out of the mess and there are still isses.
bad,"PNC says in all of their internal publications that they are trying to give control to the employee to advance their careers. However at the PNC help desk, there is a very limited number of paths to advance your career. It is possible, but not easy and not very much support is provided by management."
bad,I was told when I took this position that I would be required to work every other Saturday.  I was scheduled to work every Saturday for the duration of my employment.  The training was inconsistent. The management was inconsistent.
bad,I think it is a good company I think it is the people in place who hurts other people and force them to leave.  PNC bought out Flagstar and they made a lot of changes and elimated jobs.
bad,"DON’T DO IT!!!"
bad,On the whole it is a great company.  I truly love some of the things we represent.  There is a great set of programs we are involved in.  However the management isn't worth it.  Other banks pay much more.
bad,"I do not wish to give such review.  I have no opinion. What I learned is that its all about producing as much as you can as fast as you can. "
bad,"Started off a great place to work, after a short period of time you are expected to know or how to figure out everything on your own with no guidance which makes it extremely stressful. Managers get high bonuses when everyone hits there goals but the workers get very little bonus. Due to the managers getting a higher bonus they expect everyone to reach goal and if you dont your are heavily punished"
bad,"PNC was an extremely stressful place to work with little to no understanding from the management team. Front line workers answering customer calls, inquiries, and complaints were repremanded when not fully satisfying and making the customer happy, even when it was something out of their control. Scores for customer surveys were taken very seriously, even on the occasion that it was clear that they representative was calm, attentive, and helpful to the best of their abilities, but the customer was still dissatisfied that their requests were not completed the way they wanted and a low score was given."
bad,I obviously quit my position at PNC for lack of advanced opportunities that were presented to me. I was constantly over goal each month. Not a great place to work.
bad,I worked more then 40 hours a week and did not get paid for it. My manager did not care about his team and was just overall bad at his job. He was concerned about his own sales.
bad,"If I could give management less than a 1 Star, I would! I have never had a manager treat me so poorly and unfair as this place did. When I turned in my two weeks notice that I was leaving- the Branch manager told me I was making a mistake, judged the financial institution I was going to be working at, and proceeded to inform me how I should handle my finances and what I need to spend my money on. When I started at the company , they had 4 employees (including the branch manger, assistant manager and loan officer.) During my short amount of time at the company they lost and rehired the entire staff twice (aside from the branch manger.) Work somewhere else, anywhere else...."
bad,"I enjoy the banking accounts & other products that PNC supplies, but the particular office I worked for was poorly ran in my opinion.  The office employed an universal banking consultant that did several illegal things on a daily basis and regardless of reporting to my manager was never taken serious until things really escalated.  She was eventually let go, but only after driving the other staff to transfer and seek employment outside the company."
bad,"This company could be awesome, but the experience is taken away by manegerial flaws to the 25th power. Any company you work based on culture starts at the top. Pnc loss mitigation department heads have no real relationships with what is going on with staff and barely supervisors. Upper managemt in any way shape or form does not help to streamline a process, but add more and more to a lengthy overdrawn process as well. They believe in a do as i say not as i do sort of management style. They are exempt we are not kind of attitude creating an us against them mentality. This is not good management and it starts from the top. Seldom do you hear any good news from the loss mit dept. They also do layoffs each year"
bad,this should not be a requirement and I am not interested in participating in the details of my typical day at work. thank you.
bad,PNC is an advanced company with great benefits.  The pay is very low in comparison with other banks and for what you are expected to do.  It is a pushy sales environment because that is the only way employees can make any extra money.  The benefits are great except for the health insurance. The sales nature of the business puts employees in competitive situations which causes a lot of drama in the branches.  People are fighting over referrals and doing unethical things to make more money.  Management encourages this because their bonus is based off of the branches referrals.  The managers are not qualified.  Just because you have a degree does not mean that you are a good leader.  The turnover rate would be lower if they actually invested in their employees.   But you can't do that when the branches are always short staffed because they don't pay enough.
bad,"Managers don't promote from within, and the salary is the worst in he industry. I applied for another position in the company and was told that I need to work on my PNC Conversation, but I have been in that role for 1.6 years. Go figure!!"
bad,"My experience with PNC was as a Summer Intern.  I started bright-eyed and bushy tailed like the rest of my peers, constantly asking for feedback and doing the best that I could even though my manager I'd been assigned had passed me off to someone else before my first day even arrived.  The hardest part of the job was trying to get my questions answered when there was no one available to answer them, and then being told my work wasn't up to their standards after having a lack of support and feedback like I asked from the beginning.  The company culture described to me was friendly and inviting and open to questions, however what I experienced was cut-throat, behind your back, every man for himself attitude.  Watching Game of Thrones is one thing, playing it is another."
bad,"8 hour or more work days"
bad,"If you are just starting off this is a good job for you, especially if you are a great salesperson."
bad,"I worked there for three months before they decided to lay me off. First off, the training was not thorough. Second, when I asked for help, I would either get ignored or they would get mad at me. It was underpaid for the work that was required. The management was low and disrespectful. My manager was rude to me in front of clients and would make me look stupid and unqualified for the job. I felt worthless and unappreciated even though I tried my best to enjoy it."
bad,"PNC Bank is a great place to work, but the universal banker role should have more training. I think, if it were more hands on and interactive, that would help too. Overall it's an ok bank to work for."
bad,I was an RBC employee and then PNC purchased our bank. I absolutely hated working for them and they knew it. All RBC employees hated them and they slowly tried to get fire us all. I was one of the blessed ones I was able to walk away with another job.
bad,"Training was very confusing and frustrating. Company only concerned about their profit."
bad,"Few very qualified people are recognized. they talk a good game until you really want to move up. "
bad,"Good company to  work for but not secure. High pressure. "
bad,"I applied for a CSA position, and was hired.  I was informed that I would be working mainly at a service desk, with limited time on the teller line ( I was told 90% service desk / 10% teller line).  I found this to be acceptable, having 8 years of banking experience, I was interested in learning more about customer service / account opening and sales than working on the teller side. I was completely mislead.  I worked at the Miracle Mile branch for 8 months, and in that eight months, was on the teller line everyday, with very minimal time at a service desk. The turn over rate for tellers at this branch is ridiculous, I believe this is due to low wages and incredibly poor management skills. These employees must handle extremely large amounts of cash and are faced with the possibility of armed robbery daily, stress levels are through the roof.   I inquired with my manager, and she reacted in a very unprofessional manor.  I was then berated as to who told me this information, which by the way, she did and basically, I was treated as though I was being reprimanded, for inquiring about my current position.  In truth, I feel I was hired for one position, and the manager just placed me where she needed a body. At this point, I decided that there was something drastically wrong with what I had been told at the interview, and with the treatment I received from the management. I knew that I was never going to be able to perform the position that I had been hired for.  So within a month,  I found a position with another company, paying much better and without the micromanaging. PNC could"
bad,"I worked there as a branch manager and it was the worse place I have worked at in a long time. I was told by some to be aware of the Regional manager and upper management, but I thought maybe they were just an upset employee who quit, but I found out how so true. My boss maybe came to my branch twice in 2 years and was no support. Was cursed out by a disgruntle employee and upper management asked for the employee to come back to work. No Support!!"
bad,Very outdated computer software. Poor location. Always being sent to other locations to cover for short staff. Sale Sale Sale dont care of client's needs. All around unpleasent.
bad,"Built and expanded customer relationships, grew book of business while exceeding sales goals "
bad,"A typical day is expected routine. I enjoy to satisfy the client but tough to get vacation schedule needed, even request in 6 month advance."
bad,"Management at branch and regional level are so inundated with conference calls,  emails and busy work from upper level mgmt that it breeds an environment of uptight, frightened branch managers.  Of course, this trickles down to tellers and desk help.  "
bad,"I worked at PNC Bank during the collapse of the mortgage industry.  Their objective was not customer satisfaction, but rather it was solely about obtaining TARP money from the federal government by way of aquisition of National City Bank."
bad,"PNC Bank was great, when it was National City.  Since PNC took over, the overall morale of our department plummeted.  Things changed on a daily basis and were not communicated with the rest of the department.  PNC started to push out the people that made ""too much"" money for their position, so they could downsize and hire in new employees at a lower salary.  "
bad,A typical day was to ensure all money was counted for and transactions were completed correctly. Management was not present on a day to day basis. Co-workers would help when needed. 
bad,"My co-workers were great people dealing with the insanity of a bank in Chicago. The managers are all brainwashed ""synergy-ified black belts in Human Sigma"" drunk-on-the-Kool-Aid-ers that renders them incapable of understanding basic human needs and emotions--it renders them incapable of even understanding someone is ten minutes late because of the CTA. Overworked, over-stressed. I was never paid enough to actually live in the Chicago city limits. The payment scale for incentives/bonuses, unfortunately, favors the managers instead of the customer service associates that actually put in the work to earn good customer service scores."
bad,"I worked only in one department; I don't want to condemn entire institution. I enjoyed the fast pace of the work. It was  a production driven atmosphere. The quality and quantity of work should have been most important, but the fun timers whose outside activities (such as whether one drank alcohol, or was a movie fan, or a gamer) were kind of held to a lesser standard. Glad I no longer work there. It was very stressful."
bad,"They do have really good retirement benefits, health insurance benefits are ok, there's a lot of hidden turnover, raises are basically nonexistent, everything about you can be amazing to them but if there is one bad thing that is all that is focused on, a lot of branches constantly work without managers & have platform bankers that try to take over, you will only get any decent money if your higher up in the company, any & everything you do will be held against you, if you have to call out or leave early because of family it's frowned upon, needing time off because of anything is a hassle, they offer benefits for part time which is awesome but at the same time if you work part time be prepared to be fully taken advantage of & not rewarded for it in anyway."
bad,Not to bash them just think there a plenty of places you could be and make process and money and not feel like someone is against you and was to slow you down.
bad,"I was very excited to join PNC but after just a few months it became very clear that the politics and culture were unbearable.  If you were not in the ""in group"", you pretty much didn't have a future."
bad,"management is more concerned with the private of their own life, no structure lived off credit cards instead of doing what I have for 28 years, promised to work with wealth and wealth was never interested"
bad,"If the large banks were family members, PNC would be the crusty, mean grandfather, that never wants things to change. PNC lives in the past. The pay is far below average and health benefits are HDHP only. PNC's technology is horrible and usually doesn't work, even the customer facing technology. Shareholders love PNC, because PNC never spends money. That means no training opportunities, travel, or perks. If you are used to a company that invests in its employees, you will be very disappointed with PNC."
bad,I was brought into the company and was provided only a week of training before i was thrown in. However i excelled I my role but was dealing with domestic violence at home in which after my 90 days my manager offered no type of leave after a hospital visit and terminated me. I have yet to recieve a call to why etc or any explanation on filing a leave. I feel that although i held my end up on performance that didnt matter due to my at home life. I was thrown to the wolves and they fired me after i was a permanent employee.
bad,"PNC is the place for you if you value highly charged political environments, 1% to 2% raises, stagnant career development and advancement, poor management, red tape, and outdated systems. Definitely apply for a role in one of the businesses if nightmarish forecasting and budgeting processes presided over by micro-managers is your thing, People who are not able to do more with less while warding off armies of risk and internal audit professionals need not apply."
bad,"Overall I found that PNC and it's management team have yet to figure out that management and leadership are not interchangeable. Further, the total lack of work/life balance makes working for this company less than ideal. Still, compensation and retirement benefits are excellent."
bad,"Change in leadership have resulted in a decline in culture.  Managers are no longer empowered to make decisions, as this is all run from the top of the house.  If the CEO doesn't think there are enough cars in the garage, no one can work from home nay more.  Trying to act like a big bank, but still running it like a local bank.  If you are not in Pittsburgh, forget about it..."
bad,"A Tough spot to work for, management plays favorites, no room for advancement unless you are best friends with the manager.  Lots of work and not team work to get the job done.  Daily routine is set but no room for change."
bad,"The gentleman I was to come work for left within a few months under pressure and after that it was me training and that is about it. I originated a little, mostly outside of training I made calls on financial contacts in the area."
bad,The training is very intensive and expect you to know the position perfectly after only seeing it once. They don't give you chance to do great within the company.
bad,The company overall has many opportunities for community involvement if presented to you by upper management. I worked there through many changes throughout the company. As the company shifted so did the management. The work environments were stressful. The days were long and the staffing was short. If you didn't email the proper chain and save those emails to back up what you needed help with or to keep abreast on the expectations no one stood up if there was a fire within the branch. Loss prevention should be more hands on in training staff properly. After the Wells Fargo scandal we were told to back off selling. Once the heat died down the pressure was on. You felt like your job was on the line every day. Rather being meeting sales goals or being an octopus by doing your job and everyone else's. There's no team work or comradery in this organization. If your not a puppet you don't matter.
bad,"Extreme sales pressure."
bad,Hired by a group and then transferred to another group without any leadership and never had any interaction with the head to whom I reported. Looks that head wanted to have his own people and created a frustrating environment to quit .
bad,"My ratings are based on my feelings about the above statement.  Management changes frequently, morale overall very low. Corporate culture leaves a lot to be desired."
bad,Its ok if you are just starting out but wouldnt make it a career they dont seem to care about you as an employee or a person.I do look forward to seeing my coworkers w out them i would have already bean gone from this company.
bad,"all the time different schedule , schedule only for two weeks , work every other Saturday ,small many, no benefits on part time. Not regular hours.One week 28 hours ,next week 35 hour."
bad,"Terrible management, they put a lot on with little pay, referral expectations is out of this world, you do something good no praise and soon as you mess up the whole world has ended, and there just no respect. Only good thing about being a teller was my fellow colleagues."
bad,"Production and goals are what drive growth I understand, but the push and focus on numbers and sales at PNC are by far the worse I have ever experienced in my 9+ years of working. I have been in banking for 6 of those 9 and this company is horrible with the pressure. Every single day is littered with emails and conference calls about NUMBER NUMBERS NUMBERS. Your inbox will be cleared the day before and the next day you come in you see 100+ emails with every single branch flaunting about one account here one credit card there. We are literally coming in everyday to scam people into banking products PERIOD. We are forced to act as used car salesmen on a daily basis. Bonuses aren't even worth the effort and nearly impossible to hit them"
bad,Pnc is the only bank I have ever worked for that did not require dual control to open or close the branch. Often times you were there by yourself all day.
bad,Highly regulated work environment and the level of expectations by the management was high.  Highly sales-oriented and competitive industry where I learned to become efficient tackling multiple tasks at the same time.  The toughest part of the job was banking became primarily sales instead of customer-focus and the turnover was extremely high.
bad,"This bank has great products for the customer, however they lack moral for the employees. it seems they don't appreciate employees much. its not a hard job. But upper management is horrible with follow-ups and encouragement."
bad,"Everything was very good until I was told I needed to travel over 50 miles one way to work after working there for 3 years, I could not travel  that distance everyday so my position was eliminated. Not sure where the Manager was didn't see him in the office much, so there was not much support."
bad,"I would never recommend work from this company to any of my associates. Unfortunately, the employees are mainly mistreated and handed a whole work load down from the managers to get work done. Some branches do not even have a qualified financial manager."
bad,People are great- However compensation is horrible. Cannot balance work and personal life. Black out days for vacation. Unrealistic sales goals. Not the ideal place to work. Ver temporary position.
bad,"Not much micro management but too many changes too often. A lot of turn over. Also, a lot of gossip which I've seen get employees fired on multiple occasions."
bad,working in a branch is a difficult task and they leave things out at the interview. work life balance is not good. hard to even make doc appointments. everything is if the branch can afford you not working that day. its 6days a week unless you use vacation. bonus is hard to get when pnc approval rate on loans are high.
bad,I have been at PNC for 4 years. Customers and employees used to matter. Not anymore.  All management cares about is the stockholder and stock price.
bad,"Sub market compensation strategy. Failed pay for performance implementation. No possibility for financial growth with firm. No bonuses until Vice President level (minimum 5 years), departments limited to 1% annual raise. Don't expect for your salary increases to outstrip inflation until you get pay your 5-10 year of dues to qualify for bonuses."
bad,"As a loan officer at a big bank, my responsibility is to provide services for local branches and self gen business. Pay is fully 100% comission."
bad,"After 6 months of working at PNC, I had to place my two weeks notice. The job itself was extremely stressful. Management was poor. Everyone was close bc of previous work history . Things happen so if you didn't meet management goals they didn't pay any attention to you. However, if you met and exceeded one month, you were fine. I've never worked for a company that doesn't believe in paying they employees. Even part timers were ONLY GUARANTEED 28 hours. Nothing more, nothing less. I was never given an actual schedule. My schedule were either called or texted to me the morning of."
bad,"Ask to do too much in too little, minimums are difficult to reach. Ask to service walk-ins, do follow ups for existing clients on top of making 140 calls a week."
bad,"If you have a poor manager it will be difficult to build your skills, advance, and it can be difficult at time to work with other individuals."
bad,"- Sales culture was extremely aggressive.  "
bad,Not much to say about the company management was not supportive however customer treatment was great.  Training was very informative however this can be a cut throat job due to it being a sales job
bad,"Very challenging sales goals with a very stubborn way to approach clients. You not only compete against other banks for the business but also have to fight Internally to be competitive . "
bad,not much to say. little to offer in terms of compensation and management style.
bad,"A good entry level job. I enjoy talking with customers about their financial needs and goals. The hardest part the job is that management is not consistent in their expectations, priorities and objectives. It is a hostile work environment and very unpredictable and no room to grow."
bad,"Nice place to work for, but when Pnc Bank started to close branches and convert two branches into one is terrible... I had the best manager and teller supervisor anyone could ask for, they taught me everything to advance in my career... When the one branch closed and converted to our branch my Manager and Teller Supervisor was let go and that's when everything fell apart... Our branch was always a 5 star and now we are a 3 star branch. Our new Manager and Teller Supervisor have no clue how to handle a bigger branch bc they came from a small branch that was very slow and little staff. Our branch is now very unorganized and no communication within the branch, bc our Manager doesn't like to ask for help nor our Teller Supervisor. My new Manager also took away all of my privileges I had and is making sure I don't advance bc she is not willing to let me do anything as I use too."
bad,My position was called the ITP Mailbox. I thought I was hired to set up the borrower's loans; verifying the docs; but I was actually doing the Intent To Proceed forms.  Making sure the loan officers indicated on the forms that the borrower(s) would like to proceed with the loan.  If they did then it would go to the file prep specialist (loan set up specialists) then from there to the loan processors. It was very redundant and boring.  I felt like what I was doing was not a challenging position and a waste of time.
bad,worked with mutual funds clearing breaks daily using DST Vision.
bad,"I worked for the call center in their business department. I would get screamed at relentless by customers and scolded by QA for not being more sympathetic. The training was not up to par either. You're trained for a month before you're on the floor, however if you take on any other department functions, you get maybe a few hours."
bad,Not what i was expecting from a large financial sevices group.  Culture is shock management and technology well below standard.  The other employees cannit be rrusted because they have a culture of gotcha management.
bad,"They do have great products and pitch as far as a bank goes. The vacation time is reasonable and the work culture is pleasant at times. However, when it comes to hiring managers there should be a more extensive background. The assistant managers are not well trained in how they can manage others of all backgrounds and cultures in addition to not being dependable. The pay should also be increased for the amount of paper work that is done within a branch atmosphere. Why does a billion dollar company use so much paper? We are not in high school, meaning management should not micro manage because of the sales pressure they feel from their management and then put that energy onto their staff."
bad,"Too many to mention, just know that head payroll manager is an egotistical, self centered individual. I swear I still believe I was eliminated because I was male."
bad,"Training was the best part. No flexibility with student schedules even though I was reassured by multiple people that wouldn’t be an issue during the interview and training period. I had to call in sick once due to strep throat and an ear infection, I had a doctors note. I missed two other days of work due to an out of town funeral and had no access to a phone so I emailed my boss. 4 days later on my next shift I received an email from him stating that I had refused to adhere to company policy. Was fired as soon as I came in and told that the days missed for the funeral would be converted to paid sick leave. After he has been refusing to return my calls after $20 had been deposited into my account I was told by the call center there was nothing anyone could do as he had went against company policy. Livid is an understatement."
bad,"Don't get the flu are lose your voice because you could only get 6 days out that our  Calendar year or you need to go on short term disability. We have a schedule inherence to go by so no bathroom breaks if you're not schedule to have a break.  If you miss your break or lunch at hurts your schedule adherence and your scores go down. My break times on lunch was different everyday it was even out a point that My schudule start times was different every day to for months. You get in trouble you don't know why you got in trouble days later or months later. There was so many Tech issues thats not coded off a responsible for having Tech issues. I learned more by being on the phones and teach myself than I did from the training. a lot of information i was told to was wrong he had to figure out alone. Customer are at you because of fees, phone supervisors don't want you to ask for help. Other departments don't want to take designated call and your tl will ignore you if your numbers aren't high."
bad,"Nothing good to say about PNC Bank.  No work life balance.  As a branch manager you are expected to work 6 days a week, you are expected to make up for the sales underperforming branches don't make, and if you develop a good employee, expect them to be moved to another location."
bad,A typical day in the retail banking entails a great detail of interaction with clients. Staff may build rapport with clients who frequently visits their particular location.
bad,After 3 years at PNC you are no longer eligible for the management training program. So if management is your goal maybe look elsewhere. They only health insurance offered is a high deductible plan which  is still around $100 a week/$200 a paycheck for a single person
bad,"Management is poor.They tend to micro-manage. They rarely put any directions in writing and cast blame even when following orders. Morale is low and the opportunity to move to other departments internally is poor. They put all of the right policies on paper, but rarely follow through."
bad,"Spent 16 years at PNC....to be fair, aside form the last two, it was an enjoyable experience, but the last eighteen months became far too clique oriented an very cut throat, with management unwilling to assist most of the staff....the rules were arbitrary and many of the favored employees flaunted their position"
bad,"Branches are closing, less opportunities for growing"
bad,"They expect you to walk around inside of Giant to gain customers as well as being a teller, and a financial adviser for a low salary. The hours are long. No security guards even though we handled cash. 30 minute breaks after being on your feet for 10 hours.Upper management is only concerned about meeting sales goals. Horrible place to work."
bad,"It’s laughable that Pnc tries to preach employee financial wellness but chooses to pay $35/k a year for a risk job and a degree. Raises only occur if you meet all expectations and my raise was $400 added to my salary for the YEAR. Not a livable wage."
bad,I enjoyed my time at pnc and made some lasting relationships with many people. The environment for the most part was laid back and care free. Management was very nice and the culture was inviting.
bad,Working condition is getting worst every year at PNC.Too much  pressure for making sales. Expectations of job requirements is overwhelming in addition to my regular job responsibilites. No overtime pay
bad,PNC was an easy job nothing was hard. It was not for me. It was not what I expected. It didn't challenge me. I moved on to something that had more to offer to me and my family.
bad,"low pay for region but great job security, job turnover high which is why.. they love promoting from within but will never pay an internal pro,otion as much as an external hire."
bad,I did not like a certain manager and I got stuck working with her for the last 3-4 months of my employment with them.  This was after I was transferred from a branch that I loved without any say so from me.
bad,"Would not like to work there again.  Very little support.  Loans took way to long to underwrite, process and fund.  Little  help from management.  Worked long hours with little or no results after being top producer with Wells Fargo"
bad,A lot of BS and little opportunity.  Management is a revolving door.  ive nothing more to say.  i am just trying to get get out of this screen.  how much more do i have to write?
bad,I was hired for one position and after being hired I was placed in a different position. I was hired under false pretenses and my rate of pay was not what I was told it was going to be either.  On top of that I was put off work for a couple days by a doctor due to injury and was informed that I would either be at work or be fired. Doctor note or not.
bad,"The work environment was always great and the people I worked with were easy to get along with. I traveled from branch to branch on a daily basis. It was difficult to adjust to each branches different set of rules. "
bad,"The best part of the job were my co-workers. They were family."
bad,Management is not educated or trained to manage.  Hiring decisions are based on personal preference.  Management fails to utilize the experience and skills of the employees they have to make decisions
bad,The company does not care for their employees. I  find it hard to advance in the company.  They always say experience matters over everything else. It is very gossip filled culture.
bad,"I learned a lot about finance and mortgages.  "
bad,"The one thing I loved about PNC was there was a back up daycare at my location. I was able to bring my child/children to the day care in an emergency, such as current school being closed. Camps in the summer was very convenient as well."
bad,"I worked for this bank for almost 5 yrs, the first 3 yrs were awesome and then I got a new manager and everything went down hill. I saw 20-25 people come and go during that almost 2 yr period. I kept saying that I was going to leave, until one day they made my decision for me. I miss the customers the most. I now know that politics and loyalty cannot exist in a working environment. I wish management knew that."
bad,Borderline unethical practices. High goals and high pressure lead to a very stressful environment. Manager has no clue how to effectively lead a team. Very negative culture has led to rock bottom morale. Avoid.
bad,"Neutral opinion. Similar to other large companies as far as supporting the mission that is communicated to the street. Over the years, it has offered plenty of opportunity."
bad,"If you get pregnant your days are numbered, and depending on what area your branch is in, don't expect diversity. I was bullied while pregnant, made to lift heavy things and my lunch was my only break."
bad,You are required to sale products to the consumer whether they need them or not. Whether the products are beneficial to the consume. The banking industry is not like it used to be. This would be a great fit for slimy car salesman.
bad,"The training process was lengthy and frustrating. You were paid your reimbersments quickly, IF your manager approved them in a timely manner. Once, finally in my branch, the poor management continued and was validated by other employees. There was a lack of communication over the managers where abouts. She would come and go for hours as she pleased. We were not allowed actual breaks because of such a short staff. There was no extra coaching or help given after training, even though it was brought up to the branch manager as an issue. I personally felt demeaned and pushed aside by the branch manager."
bad,Very slow pace environment with high pressure to produce sales. Expectations are high with limited resources and equipment that does not work. Also a lot of training irrelevant to job functions.
bad,"The company lacked training and had very few managers that knew the products well enough to assist.  They pushed a very heavy work load on their employees.  The goals were very out of reach that very few people reached them.  They kept increasing the hours.  They would have us go in on Saturday too to work more and during the winter they shut of the heat.  It got to the point where they were having their employees push in a code every time they left their desk such as making a copy, faxing, taking a loan to a manager, taking a file to u/w etc.  It was crazy.  They also wanted us to call our customer every day if we had an update or not.  It got to the point our underwriters were to work 10 hours then take their computers home to work and also work the weekends.  They eventually got up in droves and left 20 at a time.  We had no one to underwriter our files and we were still held accountable for closing the loan.  It made no sense."
bad,The entire culture is based on metro banking unwilling or unwilling to understand community banking entire drive is for accounts not quality a lot like the Wells Fargo system
bad,They expect a lot of work for little pay and opportunities for advancement are scarce. Unwilling to give promotions because it comes with a pay raise means they are for more willing to give openings up to people applying from the outside rather than the inside.
bad,Respectfully decline to discuss. If this information is anonymous I do not understand why it is required. I don't see the relevance or appreciate the inconvenience when seeking employment in unrelated fields
bad,Poor compensation. Lack of training. Poor treatment and even downsizing of top performers. Great products for customers. Product benefits get worse and worse over time.
bad,PNC was under bad management. The people were all very weird and the environment was scary. The checks were always late and there was always drama going on.
bad,The employee turnover with staffing in very bad lot of under staffing issues. employee not given all the proper work tools in order to be productive daily.
bad,"Poor management"
bad,PNC Mortgage had an unusually top bottom way of managing...very prone to elitism and favoritism. The atmosphere was not conducive to enjoying work and everyone seemed to feel they were at risk of job loss.
bad,"resolved issues with bank card transactions"
bad,"Excellent places to learn cost controls, and standard operations but the excessive pushing to promote sales is a negative espically when people have a negative outlook on the banking industry, Management was also not very upfront with employees on sales goals and would randomly change goals last minute which is extremely disheartening."
bad,"Culture of the company in Florida branches needs vast improvement if they wish to keep talent. My experience was not enjoyable working for PNC, and I hope they can find more empathetic leaders in the Florida area."
bad,Productive. Company had good relationship with clients. Reviews were fair and helpful. Worked in teams for both internal and external clients.
bad,it was a face paced environment that is big on hitting sales goals. I had a great relationship with the branch manager. The problem lied with the supervisor who didnt feel like she needed to train her new hires and did little to no work day to day.
bad,Unrealistic sales goals and expectations. Not enough development conversations with upper management. Training procedures are not consistent.
bad,"PNC promotes values of work life balance, teamwork, and positivity but they do not deliver. They will make it difficult to take paid time off that has been earned no matter the reason, management does not work with employees to work towards advancement in the company. Often reject request to go to different departments when employees are eligible."
bad,"Long work days, constant turnover.  There was not a ton of positive things to say except that this was a good way to start one's career but not much more to offer beyond that."
bad,"The mortgage industry is by far the most stressful environment to work in.  The nature of the business is personal, since it involves people's homes.  Thin line between empathy and being firm."
bad,"This job, is the job like any other in the field, you sell your soul along with your morals. I learned quite a bit about financial institution, however realizing that I was pushing people into doing things with there money they might not otherwise do, and leading them in a misdirection of debt, if I didn't do this then I was not eligible for a raise and would have weekly conferences about what was wrong with my ""sales ethic"". It was disgusting to say the least, and the competition and cruelty of the others realizing what we were doing got so disgraceful I couldn't feel good about what I did everyday."
bad,"Management & the culture they create would get negative stars if it were a choice.  It's unfortunate that they ignore employee requests and input at every turn, yet force their directions and ultimately blame the employee's for their own bad decisions.  A total lack of management accountability."
bad,"Sales and Administrator professional with 25 years of experience in the corporate environment. Excel at territory development, major account management, and new business development. Organized, managed, and budgeted internal operations of various businesses. Supervised and maintained all internal accounting functions for various organizations. Provided administrative support for executives and fellow colleagues. Performed skip tracing and internet research for client information and security. Expert in all office technology and practices.  Licensed Life, Health, Property, and Casualty."
bad,The banks want to tell you how to do everything and when to do it.  This is why when you go to the banks there are so many new faces.
bad,Unfortunately my experience at this company was not all positive. This was mainly due to the hostile work environment and the constant management changes.
bad,"Mostly taking care of transactions "
bad,Great Financial Institution for clients not so great fro employees. There is no job work life balance nor support for career advancement.
bad,"Due to low market share in the south, the company is still trying to figure out the south which makes for very pressured environment."
bad,"You will be humiliated working at PNC"
bad,I come in get my supplies and start working.  I learn something new everyday it seems.  My co-workers are great with only one exception but that is normal in the work place.  There is nothing hard about my job. I love working there but they are down sizing.
bad,Management is not very good there.  They think the answer to everything is more conference calls and they like to fee customers to death.
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my co-workers and learning from them. There was always something new to learn.
bad,"For technical positions it has been my experience that PNC is great at allowing time to work from home, and having a work balance that generally allows people to stick to a 40 hour work week. This does come at the cost of nearly non-existent opportunities for advancement within the company, extremely antiquated technology, and highly dogmatic practices that requires a board of upper level managers to review and approval any code change (including 1-line code changes). For these reasons it appears the best employees for this culture are people looking for a secure opportunity that will last them until retirement. Anyone with hopes of career advancement in the technical industry working here must take it upon themselves to ensure they are working on the right type and quantity of projects, and right types of technology, to keep their skills marketable in this antiquated and highly bureaucratic system."
bad,"PNC bank is just like every other financial institution with 60,000 employees you are a number.  They are stuck on maximizing profit and reducing the benefit because all that is important at the end of the day is the stock report."
bad,"The company was ok in the beginning.  All of the old regional managers were told they were no longer needed and new regionals came in and the company started going down.  Very sales driven and you can be terminated in 2 months,  The Human Resources department is terrible. Not concerned about employees"
bad,"A typical work day you will be responsible for processing transactions, selling products, and making phone calls to set up customers for appointments. Working here has given me great customer service skills but not much else. Management is disorganized and unreliable. Constantly short handed. The hardest part of the job is meeting the demands of corporate while trying to perform daily functions. Unrealistic expectations for tellers especially when there is never enough employees to help with tasks at hands. Consistently expected to handle tasks that management is supposed to handle. Zero work life balance."
bad,Very negative micromanaged environment that did not show appreciation for employees but once a year when the company had employee appreciation week company wide.  Work can be fun and there are things management can do to make work more enjoyable and make employees feel valuable but it's all business and no pleasure with them.
bad,"A lot of work for minimal pay. Great work schedule, with all holidays off, Sundays off and shorter hours on Saturdays. Account perks were nice."
bad,"PNC's team approach to Wealth Management is a concept that clients like but not necessarily supported by management as it relates to employee compensation, responsibilities, and sales."
bad,Over worked and underpaid for job duties and assignments. No room for advancement.
bad,The worst part of the job was worrying about getting fired for the small small things. If it's even a problem in the system always blame it on the employs.
bad,"All day interfacing with clients and prospects, selling"
bad,"Micro-management!! I worked for PNC Mortgage for 1 year and that was all I could take. Their focus is on the wrong things. They are so afraid of doing the wrong thing in this industry that everything is over done to the point that the customers and employees are frustrated with each loan. They hire people from the outside and put them in management positions and they have no idea what they are doing, they have little to no experience in the mortgage industry. There is no room for advancement, you better like the position that you get hired on for because that's where you will stay unless you decide to leave. I do really hope this review helps because it's job there, not a career and not a place you will want to stay. Read some of the other reviews and you'll see, a lot of people saying the same things."
bad,Overall I was not cut out for mortgage processing.  I do feel as  though the lack of training and organization was a factor in my inability to meet the organizations needs.
bad,"a typical day starts with our manager telling us we need to open more checking accounts, bring in more loans and teaching us how to sound like robots (basically). PNC wants you to do things their way instead of having any personality at all. you are supposed to greet the customer with ""hello, welcome to PNC. How may i help you"". if you say anything else, you will have a conversation with the mgr about the ""proper way"" to do things. Meanwhile, the manager will go back into his office and post things on facebook about how his weekend was. I would say 75% of my unhappiness with PNC was my direct manager. it is hard to move up in the company. . they just want worker bees that blindly follow orders handed down."
bad,"Days began with a motivating morning meeting filled with statistics and a focus for the day. There were both peak times and down time during the day. I utilized down time by ordering supplies, settling an ATM, reorganizing my drawer, or taking various computerized trainings and tests available on PNC University. I enhanced my skills in efficiency and customer service in this position, developed relationships with clients, learned and sold a product line, and gained experience in operating various machines. "
bad,"Primarily responsible for serving as a rotating bank manager, including assisting with the general supervision of all employees. Worked in the recruiting and developing of new bank clients. Managed and directed the implementation of all new sales and services of the banks products. Developed financial plans to ensure customer use of the banks products on continual biases. "
bad,"PNC may be named ""One of the 100 Best Places to Work"" by major ratings and magazines, but ask most fellow employees, at least in Florida, and you will get an argument. This bank runs their Investments business model as a singular, centralized monolith. Florida's demographics and overall investment market creates a much, much different proposition than Pittsburgh, Cleveland, or many of the other major cities up north where PNC is arguably one of the dominant forces. Their managed money model may work well for them with the emerging affluent markets in those cities, but it ignores a huge opportunity with the senior citizens that dominate down in Florida who could care less about anyone charging them a fee to babysit their accumulated assets. Simply put; their model doesn't fit FL - a fact that falls on deaf ears with Senior Management at HQ back in PA, and that's why PNC cannot keep good people but instead keeps turning over their Advisors and their Management Team in the Sunshine State."
bad,bad hours 3pm to 2 am quiet no talking rule. attendance policy was very strict could not miss any days at all for 1 year.
bad,"The organization is keen on letting its consultants be frightened about their jobs all the time. The organization allows for the management, coaches, etc to tell the agents how they can be fired on a daily basis. When someone has had to leave for a family emergency or comes in late due to car troubles, it is marked as a full absence and you are written up for it. It seems as though the organization does not really support its families and what their outside lives may entail."
bad,"PNC is a place you may not want to consider.  Stressful nights to meet efficiency goals, while not making any errors.  10 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch that doesn’t give you enough time to get something to eat and relax.  If you go over at least a minute, you would be penalized for it.  Only thing enjoyable was the people and the pay."
bad,"As a customer service rep, you take an average of 50 70+ calls per day.  The calls are back to back with little to no down time. You do have managers and supervisor with you during every shift, but at times it can be difficult to get a hold of one of them to assist with you during your call."
bad,"PNC pretends to care about their customers' financial needs and futures,  which is true to some extent.  But their real objective is to squeeze every dime possible out of each customer.  While this is the objective of most companies that answer to stock holders, it is especially true here.  What is truly best for the customer is secondary to production and pushing PNC products and services.  As an employee, you are not encouraged to think outside the box but are very encouraged to drink the corporate Kool-Aid, shut up and do what you're told. Decent benefits and vacation policy if that's all you're looking for.  My advice, find another way to make a living."
bad,Told one thing before you start then it’s not at all the way they said it would be. Bonus scale is a joke. They skew math to off set and calculate survey results to NOT pay you bonus. Management let’s platform staff literally steal referrals (also bonus related for tellers)  from tellers. And does nothing to support teller staff when  happens over and over. Blatantly/favors lets bankers work their own schedule. It’s gross.
bad,"I was hired at a PT customer core consultant. The first 7 weeks of training are very redundant and long. A lot of self paced modules and 'role playing'.  One of the systems used does not have a training bank, so when you're placed one your first call day in training its a bit confusing because it's only been explained to you, not hands on. We have 2 trainers, one whom was great the other, not so great. The time off is a complete nightmare for anyone who has kids. You have to be there a year before you receive any PTO and if you have to take time off before then you receive an 'occurrence'. Being a previous manager at bank, I do understand the need and responsibility of being at work and being on time, but I also understand that life happens. If you get to many of these occurrences you'll be terminated. After your 7 weeks of training you go into transition for 5 weeks for is a full 6 hours on the phones with ONE 15 minute break. I was told I needed a note from my doctor if I had to get up and use the bathroom an 'excessive' amount of times. If I hadn't of had previous banking experience, this job would have been difficult for me to learn as they do not explain the in's and out's of banking very well. You have a Team Lead during your 12 weeks, then after you are sent to your destination, you will have another Team Lead. The pay is OK. I think considering the effort, customer abuse and minimal breaks, the pay should be increased. At time I feel like a work horse. You are expected to posses the BEST customer care possible, but you have to meet AHT times and other goals. If these"
bad,"I was sold a completely different job at the interview. The promise was made of quick advancement and easy bonuses, none of which was true. They will tell you it’s not a sales position, but it is. Training is minimal before they turn you loose in the branch. You wind up calling for support more often than you’d like, making your customer doubt your service."
bad,This is a bank... With a mortgage company. Don't be fooled. There is very little chance this will be a life long move. Could possibly be a good place for someone who is a 2 yr veteran of the industry or perhaps a displaced MLO suck as someone who took a few yrs off for child bearing etc otherwise not recommended
bad,"Would start, make sure no one was in bank when opened.  Then had to do presentations on credit cards, and if bosses didn't like it would have to do it again then next day, till the were satisfied"
bad,Great training off site.  Poor training and interaction at the branch.  Extremely difficult co-workers.  Job expectations required were not compensated for
bad,Cheap company that wants to save every penny. Raises are almost none while the CEO takes home millions. I had a great manager. The company also needs more diversity in Senior Management positions.
bad,"The environment is a work in progress. People are aware but not concerned as long as their dashboard is clear. Meet people in different lines of business especially those you may have to work with and get an example of projects that went wrong and how they were handled. Also, job security..."
bad,Good benefits and pay.  Talent and job performance often overlooked and good employees are sacrificed for those whose performance and knowledge are lacking..
bad,Lots of favortism. Micromanaged. Expectations are not realistic. Raises are tiny.  Negative environment overall. Every minute of your working day has to be accounted for and measured.  Big brother is watching closely....
bad,"The job description does not line up with the job requirements. PNC went through a career development change a few years back. The title of the new position was company created, and does not line up with a normal work title. This makes it difficult to apply for jobs outside of the company. There has been significant reduction of staff lately. Mostly in small amounts with no communication to keep employees in the dark with what is occurring. The company promotes work life balance, however has been slowly removing flex work arrangements. Merit increase remain extremely low around a 1% cap rate."
bad,"The environment is difficult. PNC is not known for training, so you have to learn as you go. If you go to HR about any issue with management, be certain that you  will be included in the next round of layoffs. And there will always be a next round of layoffs."
bad,The brand ambassador role and outbound team need a lot of work in the Charlotte market. The day to day consists of cold dropping into businesses like Dunkin Donuts and others to try and engage and gain acquisition.
bad,If you work there i will say everyone seems nice but they are not. The moment they can they will start rumors or talk badly to you not only amongst themselves but to customers.
bad,PNC mortage was a stressful job and felt that you were just another number in the company. Mangement only cares about how many loans you close a month even though you did not have all of the customer's information needed
bad,"I enjoyed working for Midland Loan Services.  After PNC took over, it became merely a mundane job.  No longer bonuses for non-salary positions, very few raises, no day after Thanksgiving off, no vending machines on each floor.  Workload basically doubled to the point you were afraid to take a lunch, let alone a vacation or even half a sick day or you would come back to a boat load of emails.  Pay was significantly lower compared to the competitors in the area."
bad,"I was excited about PNC when I 1st came, but quickly found out that PNC was a revolving door going to nowhere. The Comp plan sucks, the System sucks, and the chance to truly get paid on your hard work sucks. I'm sorry, if I'm selling refinances for $500,000 or better I should get more than $500. It take forever for Loans to fund too. The underwriters are lazy, the management is spread too thin, and the moral is worse than the set of Michael Jacksons Thriller. Heck at least the Zombies get to dance. The trainers don't even know the answer to vital questions and do not truly prepare employees to be successful after they leave training. MLO's made less than the Mail Clerks! Slap in the face and I wouldn't recommend anyone wasting their time. When I started it was 105 MLO's on the floor and when I left it was only 35. Don't waste your time, you'll just be looking for another place to work and that's sad because they're suppose to be a top 10 Bank. It's like getting all dressed up with no place to go! Last thing, It's not fun seeing people scared that they are going to lose their jobs. I wish some of these CEO's could spend time with their employees and see why you need to treat your front line better."
bad,"PNC Bank is a great place to work and learn but the pay does not justify the work load. There are hundreds of employees who leave their positions with PNC Bank because opportunity elsewhere presents itself in form of same work load but significantly higher pay. Management is okay, culture is fine as long as the team meshes well together."
bad,"In some instances, little to no training is available.  Too many meetings; inconsistencies; communication is poor.  There is a lot of room for opportunity within the area that I work in."
bad,when the new CEO took over the company really started to decline in supporting its employees it was a sad day when i had to chose to leave I feel I had devoted so much time and effort to a company that let me down
bad,"Co-workers at PNC are a lot of fun to work with, however the management and organization in the call center is terrible. I have had 3 different team leads (supervisor) within 2 months time. People cannot keep the job, and the culture at PNC is toxic. Everyone is really stressed out, team leaders are incredibly demanding and sporadic. You will deal with a lot of difficult and angry customers. About 20% of your call load are customers that are willing to yell to get what they want, and you cannot help them as much as other banks. PNC has a lot of restrictions and policies, hardly any leniency in the call center position. Pay is decent, however advancement is very limited for the amount of employees they have. You have to be a superstar to go anywhere. Pack a lunch, because there lunch bars are incredibly expensive and close 2 hours into your shift if you work 2nd shift."
bad,"Responsible for reviewing loan documentation for clients, file UCC's and monitor changes to client status, request/complete subordination requests.  Provide back-up assistance to peers within department for advance request processing for floorplan lines of credit."
bad,the job as teller was enjoyable the management was lacking. there was vacation time. i didn't like how we weren't able to get overtime in the branch. they forgot to give me my raise for 7 months.
bad,Management was out of touch. Very stressful with meeting goals. They hold you accountable for variables out of your control. Call nights and staying late
bad,"Poor management and lack of training left much to be desired in the branch level. Benefits including health care, dental, vision, and vacation leave were great."
bad,Teach you that customer service is your main goal each day.  Provided excellent training for such a goal which has stuck with me in my daily life.  I believe customer service is one of the most important goals of any job.
bad,"head first dive into commercial property management, be sure its a right fit prior to taking it on, good people, company and team dynamic is difficult to maneuver for new employees."
bad,"If youre looking for a place to work, this is it! They offer great benefits. Its very hard to advance. They offer great quality training. The culture varies depending on you job"
bad,"Work life balance is miserable, the department is understaffed, pay is too low to incentivize people to stay, trainers are overwhelmed with constant new hires and floor-level managers are far more stressed than they should be because upper management keeps pushing for them to have good performance despite their undertrained staff. Training timetables are repeatedly rolled back to have enough people on the phones and it noticeably affects the quality of the work. The incentive to perform is based on avoiding things you will be punished for rather than bonuses for meeting or beating goals. Again, the pay for the work is laughable, there are factory jobs in town requiring no computer skills or extensive training that pay as much or better than this position. Upper management is utterly unwilling to invest in the base-pay and number of staff necessary to keep the call center operating as intended. If you're going to be temporarily ""stuck"" someplace it's better than a minimum wage job, by far, but for any kind of substantive, appreciable career-type job it falls depressingly short as an employer. Everyone in town seems to know someone who worked there, and they do, because the rate of turnover is so high just about everyone in town -has- worked there. A better place to be from than to be at."
bad,"The joy of sharing the investment knowledge with the customers that asking for the information, informing the customers of how to invest for the future"
bad,"Self Explanatory, some good co workers and decently well listening management, but high turnover of employees. Corporate/HR not very helpful. Pay is not good compensation.... non-livable wage for tellers and teller supervisors."
bad,"During my time at PNC I have learned a lot in regards to bank policies and procedures, fraud detection and customer service. A typical day would not only be processing customer transactions, but also scheduling appointments, doing my best to resolve any client problem or complaint, making and receiving phone calls from clients, being aware of surroundings and monitoring any suspicious persons or activities, and recommending products and services to clients to better assist them as well as increase their financial well being."
bad,PNC is not the ideal to place to work in retail banking. Systems are very out of date and management is very old school and not current.
bad,PNC needs to make huge improvements in their systems that support its employees. Cannot compete with big banks like Chase or BofA. There is no work life balance in the retail bank. Upper management is clueless as to what happens in branches and what staff has to deal with. Sales goals are very aggressive and sometimes unrealistic.
bad,"Daily goal setting, customer service, meeting with business clients review accounts, go over best option, setting investment appointments, cold calling, manage team."
bad,"PNC offers a strong sense of work-life balance and accomodating work environment -- at the expense of compensation and benefits. An issues that is well known by those in power, but a taboo topic to discuss. Middle management and upwards usually taken care of well with most of the lower ranks compensated below market rates -- citing ""cost of living"" as primary justification. Top talent rarely attracted to the organization, and those that are, take positions primarily for non-work related personal benefits etc."
bad,"Universal banker, multitasking between teller, customer service  and platform desk on a daily basis."
bad,"Harsh, difficult, and cheap environment where pushing EPS is the only goal.  No respect for ""back-office"" finance workers who ensure governmental guidelines.  Inept managers who are not in a position to lead or manage, but simply drive results, whatever the cost."
bad,"best people very nice and fun to work with and to work for,they cared about you and the work that they did. they would go out of their way to do extra for those that needed it. every customer was treated with respect."
bad,The only pro for working for this company is the pay for customer service representatives. This company however lacks employees in their call centers which makes it hard for both the employees and the customers who have to wait on the phone to speak with someone.
bad,"At the end of the day, the idea is to take accountability for the ill informed decisions, bad PNC policies, or poor judgment of customers."
bad,The manager here only wants you to work like a dog and pays you for less then you should be paid for. Manager does not care about anyone but herself.
bad,"I don't know what more to say outside of the title. I have worked in management for a couple banks, and have never seen anything as horrible as PNC. The culture is so fake, phony, and full off booty kissing it literally makes me sick to come to work."
bad,Very poor training~I was a temporary senior underwriter employee hired in to help with the back flow of underwriting ! Everything I was told by the recruiter was not true/ or correct! It was somewhat of a BATE and SWITCH technique! Travel was a cluster mess - hotels were supposed to be paid for when we checked in ~ they were not we had to pay for two weeks of a hotel stay and get reimbursed - which recruiter and manager said it would ALL be paid for! MICRO management is not the word ( and I was a remote employee! My manager was a very pushy rushing person who did not take any time to explain anything - just thought that the one week in impact traing (system) would be enough - which would be if it was properly done! My former manager cannot keep an in office employee at all she has lost three employees in three weeks ( I was told ) and one girl left bc manager told her she got up out of her seat too much ( mind you she was using bathroom and getting water and making phone calls on breaks to her newborn daughter who was being watched ) and yet she was hitting her numbers and completing all work at a timely manner! Not one of the managers or teams or operation centers do anything the same - others rec'd better training depending what team you were on! Worst bank I have ever worked for ! I've been underwriting for over ten years and in the mortgage banking business for 19 years ! I was treated like a child im 40 years old !!! Pay was ok - but they hired temp employees at same skill level and paid everyone different wages people sitting in the office are making almost 9$ less than
bad,My typical day at work consists of answering phones and assisting customers with any questions that they have in regards to banking.
bad,"Short staffed, management poor, job security poor, great co-workers and I would not refer PNC to family or friends as a place to work or do their banking"
bad,"no communication any where in the company, I would not recommend working her unless you are friends with the manager or you like to kiss butt. "
bad,"Benefits package is decent, salary is below industry standard. Great people to work with. Autonomous thinking is not encouraged by management."
bad,"Come in to open the branch getting it set up for the days work. Quick start. Banking has changed and its more than just making deposits for customers and withdrawals. Ive learned how to spot investments and wealth management accounts. I've learned how to take applications for auto loans and personal lines of credit. My co-workers are very supportive and we work as a team which is great! The hardest part of the job is trying to navigate customers to the atm and to get them to the branch...especially after a long day at work. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with the public, I really enjoy working with people"
bad,I only worked there for a few months. I liked my Manager and co-workers. Manager has retired. I worked on the teller line doing various client transactions related to all banking aspects for tellers.
bad,"After many years of good service and dedication to customers and co-workers, it meant nothing to the new management that took over after branches were closed and staff was relocated."
bad,"The hardest part of the work was working through the displacement of the department when PNC took National City Bank over back in 2010.  As employees we needed to continue to work to our high standards or jeopardize any type of severance since they are an ""At will employer"" so for any reason they could fire us.  "
bad,"scan the docs scan the docs, scanning software they used, coworkers were ok I stayed to my self,job was fairly easy,going home"
bad,The company is a revolving door. Employees in the retail segment are treated poorly though the customers are treated very well. Management does not address problems and there is very little recourse for management error unless a sales goal is not attained.
bad,Hard to be fair because our company was bought by PNC and within a year over a thousand of us were let go.
bad,This company seemed to care more for the wealthy clients instead of those that drive the company. The every day consumer. They constantly wanted to nickel and dime regular customers but would waive fees to those who had higher balances.
bad,"Upper management hires lower managers based on favoritism.  Passed-over managers then leave PNC, as there is no room for growth.  With the sales managers leaving, bankers under their supervision then leave as well.  There should be many openings at PNC because so many people are leaving.  A recruiter with a conscience would not direct a candidate to PNC."
bad,"It started off good, but as time went on, PNC started becoming a lot like Wells Fargo before they hit rock bottom. Nonstop pressure for referrals. Pay not great. Not very easy to advance, you have to have a good word in. People treat you unfairly. Employees are so stressed over meeting goals they are starting to do things they shouldn't just to meet goals. It's getting bad at PNC."
bad,"The regional manager puts up blinders.  Most branch managers are great, do not work at NE unless you don’t have feelings or a life.  Repeatedly being told they don’t care about you, call you fat, tell you constantly that you’re not doing a good enough job, that you’re replaceable but the regional manager and ER don’t help or do anything about it - say we’re being disrespectful for wanting to receive respect .  Go to the west region..you won’t have issues there."
bad,"A lot of very wonderful people work at PNC. Senior leadership is terrific - very well meaning, but slow to change a 1980s culture. The problem is with the middle managers. They run around frightened, micromanage and are generally unprofessional.  There are many managers who are not qualified for their positions. "
bad,"If you love sitting at a desk listening to the same five songs on the radio eight hours a day, dealing with entitled rich old people who get frustrated when you take more than half a second to complete their transaction, and being micromanaged by narcissistic coworkers pretending to be your manager, PNC is the place for you!"
bad,"This does not speak for the organization as a whole, but more specifically to the department within which I worked. Due to regulatory pressures, the risk framework has swung so far to the right that it became unstainable to keep pace with the initiatives, and with the demands from operational risk management leaders."
bad,"Unfair personnel.  Unfair Rules.  Favoritism among employees."
bad,"somewhat ok bank to work for, very disorganized back office and support staff minimal opportunity for advancement if not nonexistent, rather confusing work place culture"
bad,PNC is struggling to meet satisfactory ratings with the OCC. As a result the risk program is under constant revamping. Changes occur so frequently it’s nearly impossible to keep up. Not enough staff to handle existing workloads.
bad,I was in an accelerated college program that did not properly train the new employees. It was rushed and not effectively facilitated. It was a bad experience.
bad,You are in so many meetings you have no time to do actual work yet they don't want you charging overtime. Management does not communicate with each other well and therefore are unable to throttle information down to employees effectively. Project managers are brought in brand new to the company and changed mid-project and there seems to be virtually no turnover.
bad,"A place where the jobs were poorly defined and little management help in establishing features, timelines, or application requirements. Even project managers had little idea of scope or project requirements and frequently changed them within a couple weeks of project deadlines."
bad,"While I liked my superiors, and they were very involved in my career development, PNC is like any other large corporation - you are underpaid and undervalued. Everyone is replaceable. Additionally, the benefits are absolutely horrible for such a large company."
bad,upper management has no clue as to the workings of retail banking. They set unrealistic goals and honestly don’t care if you work short handed or not.
bad,"Then there were constant management changes and reorgs which caused an atmosphere of fear and confusion.  I was in technology and worked a lot with other areas and some were good, but a lot were like mine."
bad,Almost every weekend I was on-call.NO career advancement within your department. Management could be better.                                                       .
bad,"This is one of the most unorganized companies that I have ever worked for. Things were always changing. Don't get me wrong change is good, but it can become very stressful when things are constantly changing. For example; our job titles changed. Our job duties also changed frequently, but our pay remained the same.  The management team was horrible. It seemed as if we were the enemy. I would not recommend anyone to work there."
bad,"You never knew from one month to the next what the strategy was and can only be described as a series of 'charge' and then 'retreat commands'.  Working hours were rough because the branches were never fully staffed and we were constantly measured against Gallup polls that we could never do well on due to staffing.  Also we were measured against goals that did not take into account staffing, market changes, and dishonest employees."
bad,"As long as your department generates revenue, you can get away with anything.  Departments that are cost centers are consistently given more work to do, with limited resources."
bad,I had worked there for 2 years with a masters degree and i had been told how good of an employee i was but when any.... and multiple openings happened for advancement i was left in dark.
bad,"I was treated horrifically once promoted and moved to a different location to work. I was thrown in with minimal training and held to unrealisitically high standards. I did not like what was told to me, how I was treated compared to the other employees, how I was pushed to do all the work and forced to train employees, while the manager only pushed me and gave severe  punishment for falling behind in the pile of work she never gave me the chance to do."
bad,Very much a fear driven culture. Aggressive sales targets and people are let go frequently. High turnover. Lack of training and poor technology. Management overall was short-sighted. Compromised long-term strategy for short-term goals even when they were unsustainable.
bad,"Can't start processing until you are issued work each day; usually right at your start time.  If you start and are not signed in you will be terminated.  Have to take specific breaks, whether you are in the middle of something or not.  You are given vacation time, but are limited to when you can use them, forcing you to turn days in at the end of the year."
bad,"Part of the larger organization, Hawthorn serves the ultra high net worth client.  The team members are high calibre professionals but the larger organization has many organizational issues."
bad,"PNC is a great company, however, the leadership or management needs an overhaul.  Each branch has its own culture.  One group of people are allowed to do certain things while others are not.  The policy and procedures are uniform but we are informed and encouraged to do differently.  Management allows bullying and instigation of hostile work environment.  Great experience at one branch and totally polar opposite experience at the other branch."
bad,"Not a busy branch. No way to obtain a pay increase or promotion. Too much downtown, makes the day drag by. Hours of operation were the only good thing. Pay was terrible."
bad,"I've been with the bank for four years in two separate positions. In both positions I've been one of the top performers in my region but nothing is ever good enough and getting anything above an mediocre review and subsequently a decent raise is extremely difficult. They will always find one category you didn't hit goal at and use it to justify their position. Bonuses can be great or horrible depending on your position and time of year. The incentive plan changes all the time. They have gone as far as to change incentive negatively for products you've already sold but of course only positively for future sales. Turnover is extremely high and staffing is a constant issue. It's not uncommon to run at half staff for months at a time, meanwhile the goals and expectations stay the same. It's not uncommon that you have to do two people's jobs. Then of course you work constant overtime and take short or no lunch. I've had co-workers quit and walk out, go to lunch and never come back, no call no show for days then quit, have panic attacks at work and have to leave, all because of the stress level and demands of the job. The benefits package is nice but you have to be with the company for 6 months before you get your full benefits and 3 years before your vested in their 401(k) and pension. So if you leave for any reason before 3 years, you lose them."
bad,The potential at the branch level is immense. However the structure of the organization provided more obstacles than opportunities.
bad,"It was an okay job.  The Branch Manager didn't know anything, you ALWAYS had to go to the associate manager for everything.  Customers often yelled at you when they would mess up their own account, and management would bend over backwards to kiss up to these customers after they treated staff very poorly.  We always had an hour lunch, but we were SO busy during lunch time, because we were down 1-2, that it was a very stressful time.  Saturdays were always stressful, with a line out of the door for the entire four hours.  Drive through was rarely staffed, so you had to step away from the regular line frequently, and customers never understood why you ""weren't helping them"".  I worked 8am-5pm, 8am-6pm on Fridays and 9am-12n on Saturdays, but it felt like I was ALWAYS there.  The branch I worked at has closed, and all of the business is done at the downtown branch.  I am still a PNC customer, but the service there is very poor... especially the drive up ATM!"
bad,"i believe i would have had a different experience working for the company if i had been under better, more helpful management."
bad,"It's an okay job... it's very mind numbing, and the pay isn't that great. You get federal holidays off and sundays which is nice."
bad,"This company has changed a lot in the last few years. They are getting rid of workers all of the time. You are just a number hence why job security is one star. One mistake and you are gone. 6 months ago i went from sitting in a room of tellers and now sit in a room of new tellers. They fired a woman who has worked here 30 years because of one mistake. Took benefits away from her 6 months before retirement! Training is a month long and worthless. You are told to sell to people no matter the situation, if the teller line is full of people you still have to tell a person in a hurry to leave, if they would like a credit card it's B.S. and to top it off they are always understaffed so if someone wants a credit card they have to make an appointment to see a banker a few days later! you get 6 dollars for referrals. They also have customer survey scores and you and the rest of the team get bonuses when the group scored highly BUT you need a 4.8 score out of 5 which is impossible because so many customers come in angry because we have new people working every week and we are always understaffed. If you want to work at a bank don't work for this one especially if you're just starting out, you make 9-10 dollars an hour to be way too stressed out because of sales, making customers happy in an environment that is impossible to do so, and being worried you wont have a job tomorrow."
bad,"The company has an urban and new way of banking, but lacks some advancement in products."
bad,It is a nice organization to work for if a person is clearly at an established level within their career who is looking for their last job. People tend to coast and are very comfortable not progressing or pushing boundaries for improvement. It is an environment that breeds stability and mediocrity.
bad,"I became an employee through a merger. I was with PNC for nearly two years. I have since left to pursue a more professional sales career. While employed at PNC, I was constantly moved around to cover vacancies, thus making it more difficult for me to hit my daily and quarterly goals. This was never accounted for. The pay, in comparison with other financial institutes, is pretty pathetic. With a four year degree and prior sales experience, I was paid right at $30k. (And the benefits were not good, so we used the better benefits from my husband's job.) I went through three managers during this time with about 6 months of no manager. The last manager I ended up with was so HORRIBLE that my husband was going to resign for me had I not found a MUCH better career. PNC expects its bankers to work like a horse to sell products to people who don't even need them, all while claiming to want the best for their customers. If you have a degree, you can do better than this - I am confident in that without even knowing you!"
bad,"Management is fine. PNC makes managers VP's however they have no say over raises or what their direct reports make. Typical corporation stuff. They hire you for under $10/hr and dangle the carrot...""I've had people make x amount..."" or ""so and so got promoted to..."" Co-workers were nice. Customer base is generally dissatisfied w/ PNC. Interest rates paid are dreadfully low. As a teller you refer people more and more to the ATM's which is in effect making tellers obsolete. Which is what PNC wants. More machines and less employees to pay benefits to. Many employees have 2nd jobs because PNC is not enough by itself."
bad,stressful work atmosphere always threatened with performance review if numbers not met. also gives higher goals when you meet set numbers.
bad,Your are required to be on the phone 95% of the day. No flexibility with the schedule.
bad,Servicing is struggling and no one knows how to fix it. I would hope they do get it fixed because it could be a great company.
bad,"Decent company, but lacks talent at all levels. Also, the culture is driven by fear. The company lacks innovation and makes it hard to modernize the business lines. Hopefully, they will get bought out to save them from themselves because the new world of banking and investments will require more up to date solutions for clients."
bad,A typical day at PNC consist of helping and serving customers with everyday banking needs.
bad,"Very good company and corporate relations but fellow staff and management have no problem slandering names and lieing about past employees. Their so called "" branch family"" doesn't matter when it comes to speaking up for promotions."
bad,"Workplace enjoyment and satisfaction depends largely on what department and manager you have.  Some departments embrace a philosophy of growth and change, while others are content with the status quo."
bad,"Lots of favoritism. It's all about WHO you know , it doesn't matter how hard you work or what your numbers are. Different policies depending on regions and no consistency what so ever. Promotion is for their favorite only! Doesn't matter the experience. You really have to tip toe and watch your back. The company itself is good but it's a matter of luck where you will end up being."
bad,"The work is rewarding, the support of work processes are both smart and efficient. The environment is racist and bias. I was harrassed, assaulted, phone menaced, and reported these actions and was ostracized and mistreated as a result. The systemic bias in their culture is problematic."
bad,"How the job functioned depended on communication and management. Very poor management at this location. Head teller would tell you one thing and branch manager would say another. Manager would assume you knew things and not tell you about changes, like alter your work schedule the day before. It gets very busy and there is no one to help you a lot of the time. Very stressful, there were never enough employees, because they would quit over the stress."
bad,They did not fully describe benefits and did not fully pay out bonuses and such that were due me.  This ruined the other good things there were about the place.
bad,"I enjoyed working at PNC because I did get promoted but I didnt enjoy working in a call center environment.  You are tied to the phone for 8 hours and have to account for time when you are not talking with customers.  Like any other call center, management will beep on your phone to find out the reason you're not taking calls.  I didnt learn anything new because i've been in a call center environment for 30 years.  Nothing has changed.  The hardest part of the job is having people yell on the phone at you every day."
bad,"PNC is not atypical within corporate America -- but it is certainly just as appalling and unethical as any other bank, it simply wields many jargon-laced smoke screens with which to shield itself. My manager barely acts like a human being. In fact, almost none of the upper management (especially the corporate sales reps from other departments) are human-like at all. Speaking to them, it's like there is not a single genuine bone in their body, like the humanity has been slowly winnowed out of their soul. I've sat in on meetings and calls where not a single direct, or useful, thing was said in two entire hours. "
bad,"PNC Bank is not very much fun to work for at the branch level, this position has become very sales orientated meaning that only numbers and calls matter.  Work life balance leaves much to be desired by working long hours with little pay.  While coworkers are fun you must stay at the position in order to move up, but once your year is up, you can only move up one career level with usually no bonus."
bad,PNC is a good place to work if you find yourself in a position where you need immediate employment. There is no real structure in place for advancement however my direct supervisor was good at explaining how she could help me. However if a mistake is made your manager is not the one you are to speak to and they have no desire to keep you once you make one mistake.
bad,"If you get hired as a teller you will be very prepared to start your job. The training is amazing and they do not let you on your own until you feel prepared. Very high sales goals which are stressful. Also management was AWFUL. Felt like being in high school and I was not in the cool kid crowd. Pay Is good, vacation days are nice too. If you like high stressful sales goals, and feeling belittled every day this is the job for you!"
bad,"No advancement opportunities, no management at all, just employees left to man the bank, high-sales pressure. Not enough staff to help out. Computer program used to search up answers to questions is horrible and inefficient."
bad,"I loved my job when I started with company but with recent manager changes there is a lot of turnover . It is a stressful environment , long days with limited staff, the sales aren't bad but you are expected to still meet sales goals when your are just trying to get clients daily needs meet in a timely manner. It is a VERY stressful environment."
bad,"•	Delivered prompt, accurate and excellent customer service displaying data entry skills"
bad,all of these companies to the forefront can need more work with communication with executive that pushing a none realistic deaf tone bar and from experience it does not make the work place a great place to be around
bad,Very fast paced at times. I learned all areas of the check incoding department. Management could be poor at times. The hardest part of the job was when it was slow and learning to deal with different people as a team. The most enjoyable part of the job was the job became like a second family.
bad,The people in Pittsburgh were not nice at all. They were very blunt and acted as if we were nobody.  When they acquired RBC they sent 2 people down here to train our department for about 2 weeks and that was it. When you contact them about a problem it was never a consistent answer. Therefore depend on who was questioning you about a situation it was right or wrong. We all got along in our department & helped one another out
bad,"Compensation/Benefits is poor."
bad,"The base pay for the work load is way too low.  What is initially expected of you can change within months, if not weeks.  They lack diversity in management positions."
bad,PNC allowed me to get the adequate training that I needed to get started in the banking industry. I would recommend the company to anyone getting started but not a good place to work overall. Lots of Micromanagement.
bad,"PNC Bank is a huge operation. Our section with Global Investment Services managed mutual funds which specifically involved preparing Form 1120-RICs and footnote disclosures for their annual reports.  PNC decided to open a global investment service section in Pittsburgh in 2008, but then decided to close the entire operation in 2009.  "
bad,Upper management was very detached and teams were expected to achieve the unattainable goals which really created a negative work place branch management was great from my experiences. But turnover and performance as a region was sub par not the greatest environment to work in.
bad,Bad from the first day as far as compensation and management but the people there were very decent. Never again would i consider spending another day within those walls.
bad,How I was told the job would be when hired vs. how it is today 2 years later is totally different.  The level of undue stress due to lack of upper management direction tends to overshadow the benefits of work/life balance.  Then when you find out that you are 20k under paid vs. the industry average it is really hard to find a motivation to stay.
bad,nice friendly people always learning new things staff very informatative
bad,My day consists of taking inbound phone calls about customers bank accounts. While on this call I must find something to sell the customer or attempt to sell what the system prompts me to sell. My coworkers are great. the job itself is not very fulfilling which is the hardest part of working for PNC.
bad,"Production environment, fast pace job.  Good group of people to work with.  Supervisors were knowledgeable and good to work with."
bad,"Horrible training, lousy managers. Supervisors who didn't know what they were doing, criticism "
bad,"The environment was beautiful because it was brand new when I worked there, however, the management was not very friendly to their staff. They overworked many of us. The trainer was very condescending if you did not catch on to what she was saying the very first time. It was so embarrassing to see her and the management belittle other employees in front of guests and clients while they were in the branch."
bad,"What I have learned from working at PNC is a comprehensive understanding of operation processes that impact production, compensation, internal partnerships accountability and client relationships. I learned how to adapt my leadership style to working in a robust sales culture in a declining economic environment in addition to working with moderate risk focused and revenue driven product solutions."
bad,"If you don't fit in with them, then they will fire you before your 90 days at will time is up. I did all my work, extra assignments even went above and beyond. But because of the fact, my character didn't fit in with their character, I was let go."
bad,"Doing everything to run a branch and all operations while managing and coaching all the employees."
bad,Job is great.Management isn’t the best. They push numbers and are phasing out Tellers. At my branch people stay in their position for long term leaving little room for advancement.
bad,I worked in the call center so this is probably a biased review. Very stressful working conditions. Incredibly fast paced with little wiggle room for scheduling.
bad,"My manager was very nice. But his manager(the regional) wasn’t. The atmosphere is pretty competitive among coworkers but as far as the company, you’re expected to sell sell sell, even when there are no new customers. It’s nonstop standing the entire time, which was unexpected since I picture platform bankers sitting behind a desk. If you don’t sell you’re given constant coaching as if you’re not performing well when in reality there are few chances to even sell."
bad,"Hostile work environment, many if not all coworkers disliked each other and made thinly veiled comments about one another. Manager did little to nothing to address or diffuse the situation"
bad,"PNC Investment Center is OK for those new to Financial Adviser role, selling volumes of clients and products by phone.  Due to high staff turnover, promotion comes quickly to performers.  But weak referrals and channel conflict with branch advisers & bankers make tough odds for long term success."
bad,"I loved my branch manager but PNC def doesn't care much for their employees. They seem to always be looking for way to put more work on their employees without compensating accordingly. When I was there many people were leaving for other banks and industries because as a bank, they are only looking at the bottom line."
bad,This company struggles to find a strategic direction and follow through on its strategic objectives. This is due to its weak leadership and inability to attract and retain talent.
bad,"Very boring job for little pay, your schedule is terrible, and you're basically a teller that can open accounts. Not at all what I expected, or was told it would be like. Management is great, and I do believe non-In-Store is probably a good job, but In-Store is not the best."
bad,"Some coworkers are professional and respectful than others. Their policies change all the time, hence you tend to make a lot of mistakes."
bad,not enough staffing and too much micromanagement.  Cannot effectively do a job and complete all daily assigned tasks and sell products (which is not disclosed at time of hire) as well
bad,The job itself was good with okay benefits and pay.  The management wasn't very fair however and you would get in trouble for mistakes you didn't make. It seems like they're moving towards eliminating tellers altogether as a company and a lot of their competitors pay more.
bad,inbound calls from customers about personal accounts and online banking questions
bad,"It was ok working at PNC, very demanding, but good place, have learnt a lot."
bad,"a lot of inexperienced persons in authority"
bad,"- cashed checks, withdrawls, deposits, maintained proper cash limits"
bad,"The main emphasis in the IT group is to complete as many work request tickets as possible, otherwise you are out the door. Regardless if the work ticket is extremely detailed or very simple, they are focused on the number of tickets you complete during the course of a days work. The ones who are judging you have no concept of how detailed the work requests can be, and make the ultimate decision that you are gone. Not a professional work environment. Be warned!"
bad,"Management isn’t great, pay and benefits are good. Maternity leave and paternity leave is AMAZING. Probably the only PLUS to working at PNC. Could use management improvements"
bad,"The staff was great, but the position its self was incredibly boring. I felt as if I was losing brain cells every time I went to work. PNC has ancient technology in their branches which makes you want to pull your hair out."
bad,"Fast paced "
bad,"The company’s technology and policies needs a upgrade. Most banks have gone paperless and have mobile keypads. Management didn’t cared about the well being of Tellers or Bankers. Management primary focus were the store’s profit proxy. I have worked so much overtime voluntarily. I believed my contribution was helping the company. Instead of a thank you I got disciplined for it. My former manager had a nasty attitude. She was all about Drama, she delayed the Business hours because she was having an argument with her ex-husband"
bad,"Great services but employees micromanaged to point of exhaustion.  Lack of leadership in Georgia market makes it hard for employees to care.  Good benefits, however"
bad,"PNC Laid Me Off For No Good Reason, but it's ok because they're a big corporation and sometimes it be like that.  It really do. I'm still working for the man."
bad,"Enjoyable job, wonderful co-workers and love assisting customers meet their financial goals and teaching some to budget.  Hardest part of job is the goals are never good enough and expectations are very stressful."
bad,"Very competitive, you can get corrective action write ups a lot due to a lot of laws and regulations.  Those who do not follow policy and procedures, spend a lot of time doing personal things  are the ones that get promoted, not the ones that actually do what they are supposed to."
bad,"I worked in the corporate office downtown and as never able to get to the real point of me being hired. I had editing their level four policy with a mentor but wasn't able to interview managers to figure out procedures, write those procedures, and then create a document that would be used to train people. The powers that be saw that a red flag from an audit had been fixed and decided to let all the temp employees go. That shouldn't have included me because the others were data entry, and yet I was let go, as well. We were placed in an old server room in the very center of the floor, so it was closed off and freezing. We were given leave to do whatever we wanted throughout the day as long as we got the immediate responsibilities done. I didn't feel like a proper employee of the place because of being both isolated and almost alienated."
bad,"Entry level pays minimum wage for skilled work.  Made multiple efforts to increase responsibility and move up within the company, however these positions were given to friends and family of regional manager."
bad,"PNC offers a wide range of services for all customers, from individuals and small businesses, to corporations and government entities. No matter how simple or complicated your needs, PNC is sure to have the products, knowledge and resources necessary for financial success."
bad,"Underpaid and over worked in my situation. People were awesome though and the experience taught me a lesson which you have to be grateful for. Overall, if you like finance, it's a good place to start."
bad,"Not a horrible company, just very bad management. Worked in several branches and not all of them were bad, but my home branch was horrible. They pick and choose when they want to follow to the rules when its convenient for them."
bad,The mortgage portion is very good and very productive. The management needs work. Human resources needs to be more involved. An exit interview needs to be added so the CEO will have knowledge of why employee's chose to leave the company.
bad,"Process all new account transactions."
bad,While working at PNC I experienced a lot of different changes. When i originally applied I was told my job wouldnt be focused on sales. When i got hired in about a month in thats all they focused on and my job was even threatened if I didnt pick up my sales.
bad,CIQ is the most important factor!! you have to upsell every single customer.. they pay you 8 dollars and 50 cent starting as a teller!! you however do get a home life
bad,Loved my job in every possible way. Coworker made and accusation and I was guilty until proven innocent even though I had been a highly decorated employee for years.  Treatment was crushing.
bad,"The only thing that matters here is making sales numbers, not the customer experience. The worst is when the district managers ride you when they don't understand what it's like to be in a branch."
bad,"PNC like any other bank provides no work/life balance. Very inflexable. Though it is a large company, there is very little room to move upward in the company. Management positions are held for a very long time, so it only leaves lateral moves with a very small raise if any. Commission for sales could be better to supplement the low pay grades."
bad,Enjoyed the wins in sales.  Spoke to corporate financial directors to explain the process of accepting purchasing cards for payments.  Enjoyed interacting with company representatives gaining trust and accomplishing sales goals.
bad,"In 2014 PNC hired 700 new employees, within 12 months 600 of them were gone. Experienced many questionable practices, particularly with Quality scoring, which I saw as their was as knocking down the bonus one qualified for.   Coaches are young and over the top arrogant, not in the least bit constructive, if anything,  they drove down moral;  management seemed to have their back all the way, no matter what. The supervisor I worked under was noticeably insecure and gravitated to the brown nosers, leadership skills were very almost no existent.  Daily Quick Start's (15 min meetings) were welcomed because they gave a moment of relief from being on the phones, sadly the Quick Starts became as daunting as being on the phones because all they were about was applauding for the  top performers followed up by a pressure to raise the bar. In order to drive you, you're scores would be posted for everyone to see where you stood in the pecking order. There were lot's  of contests to help drive you and ongoing pot lucks. Be prepared to donate, donate, donate. And if you're not the type to run around to be ""In a click"", then you were going to be seen as an outsider. Overall PNC struck me as a very paranoid  and oppressive organization, top-down. I'm all for hard work, but not having the life sucked out of me."
bad,"I have not worked at PNC Merchant Services in a number of years,  so it would not be appropriate for me to offer a review."
bad,"This particular location is not busy. More time is spent not working than working."
bad,"There where many ups and downs to working for PNC, but the pay is a down the benefits is an up. The company dose suffer from lack of communication across all job functions but has been trying to improve that with training across departments."
bad,PNC Bank is a typical work place with very controlling atmosphere. They are a corporation that only thinks of themselves and not there employees.
bad,"Co-workers were okay to work with, managers (depending if you're in the inner circle), will take up for you...hardest part of the position was keeping up with all of the new laws and regulations that the government sends down the pipeline, however the work was fairly easy."
bad,PNC is looking to move their business in different direction - CEO has a great message - Banking products are very competitive.
bad,If you only need a part time job this is great. Pay is not competitive at all.
bad,This is a conservative bank and is the sales goals are too aggressive for the lending environment that they create.  This causes a demotivated sales force.
bad,Management did not finish the jobs assigned to them. Then the whole branch suffers. Unrealistic goals. High stress low pay.
bad,Not very employee conscious. Willing to displace employees for anything. No job security.
bad,Most enjoyable part was working with the public and the hardest part was balancing the vault. My work day was very structured and enjoyable.
bad,If you can handle high customer traffic volume and enjoy sales then you will probably enjoy working for PNC.
bad,I was a remote Underwriter working from home. I had very little underwriting support or tech support.
bad,"responding to inbound calls, high call volume, organizational skills, etc..."
bad,The policies and procedures can change from day-to-day. The management helps out a lot when it is needed.
bad,"As long as there is healthy communication amongst management and staff (especially to offsite staff members), you can have a successful department."
bad,PNC was a great for their trainning New Hirer and Monthly Sales Meeting. The one thing that stands out was the none-consistancy of sales and service's. We all know that things change daily however to be productive you must stay consistant with your staff. What goes for one it goes for all. They must also listen to what the staff is saying in order to get a feel for consumers needs and increase sales. If you have someone doing a job and increasing sales you go with what you have and work with it. Sales is the object of the game as long as you are following the banks guildlines and not putting the bank in a bad position to lose business.
bad,Over the time I've been here the level of micromanagement has steadily increase. Things are mandated by corporate that way. They have a department that does nothing but listen to your phone calls. You have multiple meetings that produces no results throughout the week. You never get consistent information from the people who are supposed to be there to assist branch employees. If you like to be able to think for yourself this is not the place for you.
bad,"PNC is not a bad company compared to other financial institutions. "
bad,"Too much off-shore contracting has made their software a nest of vipers, mixed with outdated technologies and a minimal-change = minimal-risk mentality, and this is a death sentence for any programmer with pride in his or her work. I would never recommend working here to any form of IT professional."
bad,Very slow pace environment with high pressure to produce sales. Expectations are high with limited resources and equipment that does not work. Also a lot of training irrelevant to job functions.
bad,"It's a really good place to work, if the schedule will work for you. The pay and benefits are great!!! Working every weekend is the only part that is not ideal."
bad,"It was a good job to work at to get a start at first, but I am extremely looking forward to moving on to a different career."
bad,"Every man for him self type of atmosphere due to the fact goals have to be hit, training of new employees is really unorganized"
bad,Typical banking structure for the Northern Virginia area.  Many locations that offer flexibility of work location. Benefits are on par with other banks in the region.
bad,A great customer service job but not much room for advancement. A great way to get your foot in the door with the company. A great job that requires you to be detail oriented.
bad,"PNC is a great company to work for but they need to train their employees on everything, not just opening accounts, if they want their employees to sell their product, they need a class on just that! They expect you to know everything on your own."
bad,I worked for PNC for 5 months and was bullied the whole time working there.  I was scold about things that their own employees for more then 2 years were violating.  The training is horrible and if they didn't like you that was even worst.  They leave you in the middle of transactions you don't know how to complete and then blame you for making the mistake when the head teller didn't show you how to complete it.  All she did was click things on my computer without showing me how its done and when I asked for help they always had an attitude.  I learned about important cash limits 4 months into my employment.  The other tellers all did things that violated PNC policies and when I made the mistake I was yelled at when I was just doing what everyone else does due to lack of training.  I had a Panic attack in the middle of a transaction because once again they left me with something I wasn't trained in and got yelled at by my manager on why am I crying and why cant I calm down . That made my panic attack worst so I had to walk out of the branch.  There is a lot of gossip going around and favoritism
bad,"on a day to day, I learned many banking terms, how to perform different transactions as well enhance my service skills. I work closely with upper management, which helped me produce at a high level."
bad,Many policies and procedures that have to be followed or you could be fired even from one mistake/accident. You're expected to talk to customers and engage them while also paying attention to these policies and procedures and counting their money. You are also expected to meet sales goals such as upselling credit cards and accounts offered by PNC.
bad,"A typical day is to Open the branch, Log onto your computer, unlock the vault, get drawers out, run night drop deposits, open the branch, run deposits, withdrawals, answer any questions that clients may have about accounts, cash checks, balance drawer at the end of the day, and close the branch."
bad,pnc didnt care about employees. I have two small children and the branch i'm at is understaffed they want everyone to work 6 days a week all day everyday and stay late.  they are the lowest paying bank out of all the banks
bad,Great enviorment wonderful treatment to the clients makes them feel at home. It was a great experience. Employess could be better.......  hardestpart was managing time
good,PNC needs to get Managers that truly care about their job and not collecting a paycheck.  Every branch is different. It is not the way they say it is.  Random checks on branches to see if the culture of the company is the same across the board is need.
good,"Our department recently experienced a change in management. Over the past few years under previous management, there were no promotions, non-competitive compensation, bare minimum raises, hardly no work/home life balance and zero appreciation (from upper management). These situations have led to low morale and very high employee turnover; we have been losing talent to other banks that provide much better compensation. I can only hope things gets better under new management."
good,"Good place to start a career and find better employment. All the good people quit, but the CIO will tell you they are hiring and retaining more than people are leaving. Good people to work with but we are the hardest to do business with."
good,management is always changing. Someone needs to figure out why we keep changing people around. It was good company to work with but everyone is micromanaged all the time.
good,Fired because I did not fit in and they were sure to bring up that it was close to my 90 days anyway. I was pt regular.
good,"Benefits are great. I worked there for four years and have only made 1K more. Obviously, with no performance issues that would deny a raise. It's a big company. You are just a number."
good,"Work environment was not very good. At times, the training was not sufficient and there was no flexibility for good work-life balance. Some of my colleagues were not supportive at all an there was a lot of politics involved. The work environment didn't allow me much flexibility and the exact job description was not made clear at the time of he interview."
good,"PNC is a stressful work environment to be in, between the everyday tasks supporting the customers they also give you a million things to do as far as stalking customers for more sales etc. calling there homes being yelled at if sales goals aren't made"
good,"On a typical day, it is business as usual and I learned to be self motivated. I worked under different managers, some very professional and pleasant to work with, others very poor at human relations. Workplace culture is good per company policies, but under a manager who is inexperienced or mischievous, workplace culture is nothing to write home about. The hardest part of the job is relating with managers who are not good. The most enjoyable part of the job is doing what you are experienced at."
good,"Sales goals for branches are the same across the board no matter if you work for a small branch in the middle of nowhere or a branch on campus, goals are still the same. Very difficult to advance. Structure of the company is changing to where everyone at branch level will have to do everything without getting paid adequately. I researched my pay based on the skills I have and I am getting paid $10,000 LESS than the average."
good,"Nice to work. However one particular manager, she always on people case. was not considerate of other peoples feelings. she would start insulting ad downgrading you in front of other colleagues. The top manager didn't care because hi to busy sleeping with the employees."
good,"A good company, needs more structure and better management training.  Location plays a major factor in quarterly targets. Good vacation and sick day benefits."
good,"regional management is poor, and ruins the experience foe the branches. Too much micromanagement. No room to advance to another division of the bank unless you live in pittsburgh."
good,"A typical day at work: Review and respond to urgent emails, regarding loan application status, process etc. Attend team meeting. Work on loan files to obtain approvals for mid or final review."
good,This job is a virtual customer care service. It is hard to communicate via Skype. Training is thorough but not thorough enough. Alot of sitting. Customers are hard to deal with and support is there but not easily accessible. A lot of challenges in 6 months.
good,"Technology is outdated, don’t appreciate employees . They are always bragging about how much money they make but give employees no raise .. just a poor company over the years"
good,"I worked for PNC when it was previously National city. When it was National City it was awesome, you could just do your job and service the customer, help your customer, and not feel forced to sell something to them,"
good,"They have made it so one position covers them all. One employee is responsible for all branch jobs. Being a teller, being a loan officer, being a customer service representative, being a notary, etc. There were very few days that I got more than a half hour lunch, would work at least 3 weekends a month but it was very offten over a month before I would get a weekend off. They rely heavily on gallop surveys for performance reviews. Where you may get one review a month but have hundreds or thousands of interactions the one review determines everything. So if it was your one ""off"" interaction a month that's all that matters. The pay was not worth the job at all."
good,Very stressful call center environment. From the moment you punch in your availability your phone will ring. Very seldom do you finish a call and have a moment to regroup before the next call is coming through. Grading of calls by quality staff is inconsistent and information given to customers is inconsistent as well. Managers typically do not challenge scores from quality which effects the bonus you would earn.
good,"No support/training from management"
good,"Pnc is Great to work for i had a wonderful experience my first 2yrs there.They could use some management from with in the company, Management could be much better."
good,Terrible work life balance...Buddy buddy system. Not what you know its who you know. They promote from outside instead of inside. They were hiring team leads from off the street and being trained by the agents
good,"there was no work life balance at all , I loved that job but the managers were very rude they helped who they liked the push up who they like so it felt like they didn't care about nothing but there numbers, they preach very hard about work life balance and there wasn't any, but I really love that job and what it could have been for me"
good,"There is a lack of communication when it comes to the federal regulation changes in the banking community. Management is unorganized and regularly unavailable. Co workers are kind and extremely helpful when answering questions. It has long hours, great if you live in the city, but expensive if you need to commute."
good,"Not much training, promised a better paying job and room for growth and did not receive, you can't trust other employees, management doesn't seem to care"
good,"Supervisors did not make employee expectations clear, staffing was always short, working there was chaotic and stressful, all staff was severely undertrained."
good,"This position was brand new and it was like developing a new business more then working on a structured and established department in the bank. The advancement prove to be non-existent and that where the down fall begins with this position. My thoughts and ideas of the position was far different then management and that didnt help the department. This position as an advertiser became a guerilla sales position, which was not the best idea as ghost accounts were created by potential customers just looking to take advantage of the promotions."
good,"Used to be a great place to work. I no longer am there, but so much has changed and I feel that they no longer value their employees as much as they did in the past."
good,"The job isn't hard but when management shows favoritism and picks on the employees it's hard to function and have a health work environment. There is no balance between work and life as PNC values and conduct portrays, the Southgate Dix Toledo branch lacks help"
good,"Too many non-productive meetings, too much reporting, management needs revamping. "
good,"It is difficult to put into words how much change the organization is undertaking around project management. There are levels that are very committed to an agile form of project management while the underlying management takes that with a grain of salt and proceeds to move forward with their own ideology and process. There is a great deal of dysfunction in this organization that would lead one to believe that it is impossible to predict how a career would go, let alone the first year of employment.  As a former military member it is easy to see from a team perspective that this is a recipe for disaster. And, if you cannot move ahead with positive influence it is best to remove yourself from the line of fire. And, that is what I am doing."
good,"Meeting and speaking with a diverse group of people is wonderful.  I have learned how to network with people and help people understand how money management affects other areas of their life.  Therefore, successful management is necessary. This position allowed me to combine my ability to teach with understanding finance to help people create, meet and exceed their goals."
good,PNC is a great company but the Lexington region is broken. It is basically a dictatorship that runs counter to what the company wants. It will get fixed eventually but not until regional management is replaced.
good,"-good pay"
good,"The first year I was in the Customer Service Call Center taking inbound calls. Explaining escrow, taking payments on current loans, open tasks (request) from misapplied payments, requesting payments for insurance and/ or taxes, copy of 1098."
good,"The customers are what made this job great, and enjoyable to come to work."
good,Is a company with it's heart in the right place. Management is lacking. Technology is far behind. The company seems to be falling backward instead of moving forward.
good,I had worked for the company for 8 yrs and had no real complaints until they decided to start cleaning house and firing people for anything and everything while shrinking the department.
good,"Was a decent job that helped me learn a lot. I worked for a total of 2 different branches, and had volunteered to several other branches in the area during my time employed there."
good,I liked the location and work hours of branch.  The branch has a huge lobby so lobby engagement is the up most important.  The most enjoyable part of my day was when I was able to help a customer with their financial needs and gain their loyalty and trust.
good,They make you sit in the training for two weeks after that they expect you to function like a pro unreal. Goodluck if you get a manager that is not supportive and criticize you for making a mistake.
good,"It was hard working there longer than anyone else and being pushed aside for the men."
good,"My immediate supervisor was racist and didntblike me because I dont have a religion, butbother than that i really loved this job. Creating and tailoring letters of credit was really fun."
good,you have the option to make lateral moves within bank but moving up does not seem possible unless you have seniority. micro management has become the way of life.
good,"The branch I was located in was a very busy branch. Expect to be on your feet almost all day and deal with all sorts of customers. The biggest problems I have faced within the branch is poor management and time management skills. Many people have come and gone from the branch that we will be short staffed on many occasions in which we have to take on extra hours. Also, if there is a difference in anyone's cash drawer, everyone working that day have to stay until the mystery of the missing or extra cash has been resolved. There were plenty of times we had fun and weren't too stressed but those times are rare. The branch I was in was very busy so serious yet smiling faces had to always be present. Sales are very important there, if you're not meeting goals then you will be terminated before your year is up."
good,It was a good place to work. Unfortunately I had to resign due to family issues. The were not willing to accommodate a different shift in a timely manner for me to keep my employment there.
good,"PNC Bank is a great place to work for entry level positions. I have learned a great deal throughout my tenure there through coaching, development, and collaborative team efforts. Upper management however is out of touch and does not seem to care for their employees much more than a number. There’s a great deal of micro management and conference calls. The most enjoyable piece of the bank is servicing the clients of the bank."
good,"Lack of management & structure from Upper management; Sale driven. "
good,Its a great starting job for banker but i feel that they can be more involved in the development of there employees and pay is not great at all they pay the least from all banks
good,Just bad management. Does not appreciate the employees that works at night. Benefits are good. Very strict on the quality of work and the productivity.
good,"When PNC took over Midlantic Bank, it was a change for us all. But, when the change of management began, it was not easy. During the last year working at PNC I had a very bad experience that made me loss confidence in working with the ""branch"" I was assigned to."
good,"Overall, the company is a good company to work for. However, the regional manager has made it very hard to want to come to work anymore! We've lost a lot of great employees in our region due to the regional manager. Of course, anywhere you go, not every manager is going to be a great one, but this one is the WORST RM I have ever worked for! Far worse than when I worked for Wells Fargo. If you want to work for PNC, I would recommend doing it outside of the Fayetteville, NC region!"
good,This particular incidence I was told by a manager that they did not even find the incident that was brought forward. They owed me money for consults and referrals I never received and 2 was before I was fired the referral protocols were changed
good,The company was okay to work for but they didn't offer me career advancement. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing and talking to the customers.
good,"At the Time, management was not good. Inconsiderate of work life balance, they never celebrated success or recognized staff. Everything was centered around sales and that your numbers were never good enough."
good,"Management is very non-responsive.  Salary is low and does not increase even with exemplary job performance.  Excellence is not rewarded.  Work atmosphere is fairly laid back with the exception of people who have disturbing personalities and tendencies.  Those employees can do whatever they want, including refusing to do assigned work.  Management is weak."
good,The managers at PNC do not know how to manage their people properly. They have favorites that can do no wrong. If they don't like you for any reason they will treat you poorly.
good,"Very fast pace sales enviromrnt, leadership skills are a plus, must possess great customer service skills. If you are looking to advance and grow in your ca"
good,"I have been with PNC for a little less than 2 years. In that time, I have learned a lot from PNC. Their training is excellent and the support system is great. However, the pay is very low for all of the duties and expectations. It is also difficult to advance in your career if your branch/location is short staffed. There is rarely a conversation of your future within the company."
good,"the company is all about sales. Your life doesn't matter there is no support for new hires, employees are rude and not helpful, management doesn't care. unless you go in with prior PNC experience you are pretty much set up for failure."
good,"I did not have a good experience. But you might."
good,While working at PNC I have learned a lot about business and how it can mess with your life.  Recently a whole department had been transferred from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh.  The training that was involved in this move was absolutely zero.  It was kind of non existent and the management expects that everything needs to be done with precision and expertise.  Its an absolute joke how they treat their employees.
good,"Long hours,  you have to learn how to listen and understand what the clients require."
good,"The job has changed a lot recently.  To keep it short and to the point, the company is a decent company to work for, but there are a lot of limitations to advance."
good,Trying to advance at pnc is very hard.  With all the qualification the comment states we found someone else that has more experience.  The work place is micro managed . Employees do not particpate in any activites due to work needs to be down at service level.  Morale is very low.   Try several times to apply in different areas but never was considered.  They state age is not the factor which it is.
good,"Co-workers here are fantastic, made the day better.  Typical day at work was spent calling clients on investments.  Did learn a lot here as the shear volume of clients contacted forced learning and how to sell.  Management here is non-existent.  Never knew what was going on or how to manage people.  Micro-managed to the max (needed to know what you were doing every minute of the day).  Back-office individuals don't contact you, just go behind your back with everything that happens.  Lots of ""I only care about myself and won't help you"" goes on here."
good,Learned a lot about government regulations. Banking and Mortgage guidelines. Gained experience. Micro-management is very challenging to deal with. Poor leadership. The most enjoyable part of the job is researching and ensuring that the customers payments are posted accurately.
good,"After all the resposabilities that I have I don't feel that the salary is acording with the job."
good,"PNC Bank was a top notch employer. Keeping the financials in the black and fulfilling needs as possible.  PNC did go out of their way to keep employees happy.  Management was always looking into getting new functions to keep staff happy."
good,"They love their customers but they do not value their employees at all there is 0 room for growth and development with his company they prefer to hire outside the company for open positions instead of promoting from within."
good,The job in itself is really not bad . If you have a full staff of people and everybody does there part . Pnc just need to take a good look at there management staff and see why people really do not stay long . Overall the company is a nice company .
good,"Typical day at work is from about 8:30am-5:30 or 6pm depending on if fully staffed or not. Hardest part of the job is not able to work freely but being micromanaged. Cannot get more than 10% raise per year, so if you got promoted you are stuck with whatever salary you earned."
good,PNC has the best processing system in the industry however management is horrible. The pay is decent but if you like being micro managed this is the place to go.
good,"A typical day at work depends on what area you work in, In the PG county area the branch is always busy and the management was always focused on sales and what could you get from the customers they didn't care about what the customer actually needed or didn't need they just wanted us to sell. The work job life and work life balance was very uncompromising because we worked 8hrs a day Saturday through Monday and Sunday we were open for five hrs as well as certain holidays so only your vacation was a way to get away and actually enjoy some home life. There was never any job security at PNC they looked at you as a liability if you didn't earn them money or if you were costing them money and advancement was chosen by not how hard you work but the major of the advancement I've seen came by favoritism. If there is a turn around in management the job culture would be a lot better because the stress starts small but when the stress builds from the upper class management down it shows throughout the company down to the FSC so PNC as a company needs to work on their management and job culture as a whole. The compensation....WHAT the whole breakdown and system that they have is ridiculous I never was satisfied with my quarterly earnings plus it took to long to recieve such antipated income....sorry wasn't good enough for me!! The benefits well you still pay more out your pocket then what they cover so there you go!! It was a interesting experience and I met interesting people but I am blessed to have found somewhere else that cares for me and actually cares about the customer and not the"
good,"The benefits are not good as far as health insurance but the compensation is what holds people to stay there working because bills exist and people need to get paid. Management will seek out where your weakness is and play on it until you have a breakdown or you find something else and quit. I would have passed up on PNC Mortgage, if I knew that they didn't care about your work/life balance. There are no goal-oriented goals to achieve in department and you will be worked endlessly to whatever management tells you to do, if you don't bend to them, they will find a temp or someone who for cheaper would do so."
good,"Job was not hard just management was not fair. A typical day was fast paced. Co workers were pretty easy to work with and finding easier ways to do things was really enjoyable, it gave me a chance to get more knowledgeable."
good,"A typical day consists of being constantly reminded how many people in this world have no clue how to manage their money and that you are solely responsible for anything negative on their accounts.  Not all is bad, though, There is much to learn in the world of finance.  Learning about CD's, IRA's, 529's, and much more is an exciting part of working in banking.  The co-workers are great at the branch that I work at, however, everyday you hear about how much dysfunction there is at other branches."
good,Love the people I work with however there isn't a defined policy. It's like they make it up as they go along.
good,"This was a contract position that was intended to be 40 hrs/wk. Over the course of the 18 months it actually lasted it averaged to around 26 hours/week. Compu-Com (the prime contractor, Insight Global was secondary) was unable to create a steady supply of new equipment to the technicians keep them steadily busy. Some weeks had no work at all others were full. No benefits, paid time off, or anything else. Enjoyed the end users I worked with and the PNC support staff was mostly very helpful. Flexibility is the key here."
good,The supervisor was nice and friendly. She made me feel at ease and was trusting and had high regards of me. She was impressed with me and decided to hire me on the spot.
good,"Company misuses its staff and expects the impossible to be completed by limited staff in short timeframes."
good,When you’re hired for a job you EXPECT to do that job right?? Well that’s not how PNC looks at things. I understand that you have to help out with certain things but when you don’t get the proper training and then you’re thrown out to the wolves is terrible. When you take the proper steps to discuss it you will get blackballed
good,"There was a very high turnover and they started to fall into the Wells Fargo business way. I was a floating teller, the pay was bad but the mileage check made up for it. After being there a year, I noticed they were focusing more on sales than the actual customer."
good,"This place paid descent the supervisors were rude and very condescending, not understanding at all it was like high school. It’s a great place for someone straight out of college"
good,"Not a Good place for Work/ Life Balance. I was hired as a permanent employee to work at the Branch in North Seminole county, not as a float staff. They would wait until I got to the office to tell me they needed me in West Orange County. The drive alone was over an hour. They should have let me know the day prior if there was a staffing issue.  If I said anything about it I was pulled in the office and told I was not a team player and that I was embarrassing the manager."
good,"Location is everything with this company, you could go into a great smooth branch or you could be in a scene from Alcatraz. Unfortunately my management was very poor. Regional manager didn’t seem to care. Manager didn’t allow us to speak our mind with new ideas it was either her way or the high way. As I said Pnc as a company is great. Ok pay and good benefits. They could work on not making the job so demanding so employees can spend time with their families during holidays. But do research on the branch you work for before being hired. Make sure your manager isn’t putting up a front in your interview. Ask a lot of questions."
good,"I witnessed my manager 'piggy back' off of my sales, we were required to record all of our employee referrals and after I made a referral they would approach the client and talk to them again.  Going over the same financial products I did and then make a referral for themselves."
good,"Typical Day:"
good,If you want good work/life balance do not work in a PNC in-store setting. You will work weekends and holidays. The bonus structure is based on credits and you get paid one percent for each of those credits. The salary is significantly lower than most banks and credit unions.
good,"PNC has the potential to be a great place work. However, in the past 2 years there's been an extreme lack of leadership resulting in a very high level of turnover. I mastered many skills, and enjoyed the opportunity to grow client relationships, but the focus changed in to a more micro managed, sales oriented environment, where the branch manager's had little lead way to make judgment decisions in the best interest of the team, or clients. The Region's Leaders don't care about the branch employee's. There were many days they would enter the branch, and not speak to the staff. That in itself makes one feel unappreciated, and devalued. A main reason for the increase, and loss of many valued, tenor employees due to the ability to break down the regions morale. The benefits are okay along with the chance to earn incentive bonus. Communication which is one of the company's core values was almost nonexistent. Sometime new hires aren't given a fair chance at proper training, and advancement depends on who you are, Overall PNC is a good company when led by consistent, strong, management. Loyal employees create loyal client relationships."
good,"VERY, very heavy sales focus to the point that the customer's wellbeing is placed behind the company's production quotas. "
good,"There is not much appreciation for customer service employees. If you are looking for a place where you can  Advance, this may not be the place if you do not have a schedule that accommodates your work and home life. You will see people come in after you and get placed in your desired shift. The way to survive at this company is to become friends with management and hang out and party. On other hand there are lots of carry-ins and if you work full time you do get great benefits"
good,"Expected to work well over 40 hours a week as a salaried employee, but docked pay repeatedly if hours dont add up to 40. Repeatedly forced to come in 6 days a week even if goals were met."
good,"A typical day at work might involve calendaring and problem solving for various managers and team members.  It can be exciting and challenging to reach the correct party for solutions of the upgraded systems.  The workplace culture is spoken of very favorable by management, but the talk and the walk of the organization are not always in sync.  I enjoy working with my team members."
good,Used to be a great company. It's not as great as before. Low salaries and only new employees will get more money but then once they are here they are stuck. Lots of cliques
good,"Work 6 days most months, unless you request a  Saturday off. Very micro managed. They wanna know what you are doing every hour of the day. No time to focus on personal life. When you do well and achieve your goals they want more."
good,"Fast paced environment, every day is a challenge, 10 hours of mandatory days. Job is easy but fully details, I have knowledge on working on mailroom,scanning,opex150,opening mail and a little of data entry,encoding"
good,"PNC's culture has changed significantly. Very sales-oriented, no room for growth and I don't feel they do what is best for the customer. The company is a game of politics."
good,"This is a stressful work environment and they only offer temporary assignments. Overworked and underpaid is theme at this job. During month end which is the last week of every month, work life balance is near impossible. Room for growth is nonexistent. Take your time and talent elsewhere."
good,In the branch that I worked at it seemed as though you couldn't advance your career.  People wanted to hold you back.  They didn't want to see anyone succeed.
good,"The only issue I had at the branch I worked in was the manager. She would stand behind each employees desk one at a time. When an issue would arise,she wouldn't get involved. She would go back to her desk,put her feet up on the desk and drink her coffee. Would tell others to handle it. Her boss even told her she doesn't treat her team members respectfully. She was dismissed."
good,"I received very little support as an advisor at PNC.  Additionally, the management style was that of lecturing on a regular basis, not of growing and developing people.  The expectations were unreasonable.  The branch managers were not rewarded financially for the business the Advisor generated.  They were told to do it but there was no incentive.  Moving from branch to branch was difficult, only being in my ""office"" once or twice a week.  Towards the end of 2015 I was informed that my percentage payout was going to decrease by 20%.  I found that unacceptable and began to look for new employment."
good,It was a good job but they don't care about employees. The people were nice to be around but there was no work life balance. I feel like we didn't et paid enough for what we did.
good,I have no work life balance as a full time consultant.  I have asked for a schedule change for over a year now. And was forced to take a part time schedule just to be able to be home when my children  get out of school at 4:30pm my schedule of 1:30-10pm was never the ideal schedule forever.
good,"Sales, Sales, Sales.  Be prepared to hear about them multiple times a day.  They say they are more concerned with customer service, but the push day in day out is for sales."
good,"They are bogged down with too many committees and owners of everything to the point that noone can make a decision and they get stuck in analysis paralysis.  However, all the leaders tell everyone about the progress they are making but it is all vapor ware.  The head of tech and ops is the key to this mess and until he leaves this will not change.  If he doesn't like someone's opinion he removes them. Have seen several great leaders get pushed aside because they spoke their mind."
good,"I was a vault attendant.  I had to make sure that our employees had enough money to work with all day and I had to balance the vault daily.  I was also a customer service representative assisting our customers with the best service I could give them.  Answering questions about their accounts, focusing on giving the customer what they needed most whether it is a up-grade on their checking account, an IRA for the future or just listening to what their needs were. It was a very difficult job at times when we were busy because I needed to be there for the employees not just the customers."
good,"It was a nice place to work but it was also just a lot of rules that people that didn't follow the rules. Did what they wanted to do and not get into trouble. The ones who did do the work got told. the hardest part of my job was having to deal with issues that people didn't want to do their job."
good,"Lots of cold calling."
good,There was very little chance of advancement. Actions by management left employees feeling distrust towards management.
good,"Management is incompetent and lazy. Processes and procedures were poorly managed and each department within the company reflected this. I would never refinance or originate a mortgage with this company after experiencing first hand the lack of integrity they posses. Pay was okay however,  there is no stability. Constant revolving door of hire and fire."
good,"Branch operating on a skeleton crew.  Expected to do other duties not listed on your job title.  Constant changes in management. "
good,Terrible place to work. It is not about what you know its about who you know. You can be the best candidate for a job but if the upper management just like somebody more then you. to bad so sad.
good,"PNC is a good place to break into the banking field.  The culture is very conservative where many people hold personal agendas and are uncomfortable with any younger professionals.  The work was monotonous.  It was not encouraged to investigate new ways to complete items, nor was welcomed to ask ""why?"" Management made decisions based on their personal opinion of a person rather than the quality of the work.  Dealing with the culture was difficult but I made some of the closest friends I could imagine."
good,"PNC overworks and underpays you. Not much room for you to move up and when you do, they try not to increase your salary. The management is also poor."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my co-workers and accomplishing our goals each week.  I also enjoy my clients.  I take great pleasure in customer service and keep my clientele very satisfied.  I meet my goals not only quarterly, but annually.  Management has a tremendous amount of red tape and politics!"
good,"Nice company for benefits and salary, not very much support from management when facing complex issues with productivity. Not a team environment, lots of red tape."
good,"Great teamwork environment"
good,This company taught me how to work as a team and not alone. I learned how to deal with multiple personalities. I learned how to work as a team to meet company's goals and deadlines. It also taught me that I'm better off working for myself and produce a significant amount of income.
good,Its all about who you know. Pay wasnt very well either. Management went through a lot of changes too
good,"Typically when going into work, I'd log into my phone and get to work taking or making calls. Typically we'd get pulled from the phones to be trained or have refresher courses to ensure that we're up to date on all policies both governed and company policies. Co-workers are like family, everyone is really close in my department. The hardest part of the job is not having the room for growth and not being compensated for as much as we know or handle/do on the phones. The most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers and if you have the right supervisor they do little things to ensure you're happy and comfortable."
good,"Working for PNC bank had its ups, but mostly downs. If you want to be a suck up to people who don't appreciate the quality of worker you are then this is the perfect job for you. Teller manager will always be on your back and tell you what you're doing wrong, there's always going to be a sense of favoritism working for a bank. The clients aren't the problem, the problem is internal. Manager can be irresponsible and throw away employees, there is not enough appreciation for employees you will do favors and not get any favors done for you. The most enjoyable part of this job is when you think you're doing everything you're supposed to, up until someone of higher power has an unnecessary biased opinion about your work."
good,"Customer service is busy position with client activity. Listening to problems with accounts or finding the best solution for banking needs."
good,Everyday your duties were to service your customers with everday banking transactions. While doing this you need to have 5 star customer service. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult situations with fraud. The most enjoyable is meeting new people and learning new things. I learned about different frauds and scams. How to invest and make good savings decisions.
good,No allowance for simple mistakes. Pay was not equal to the expectations and stress that were expected.
good,"A typical day at work, show up with uniform and on time, on the other hand your day would start wrong and all your stops would be late. I learned to drive a bigger vehicle than what I have and different routes such as different places in New Jersey. Management was ok and co-workers the same. The hardest part of the job was when I was locked in between two steel doors for more than a hour and not being able to come out until someone would come or answer the walkie talkie. The most enjoyable part of the job was when you would show up at your destination and someone from the bank would need you to translate."
good,"Typical day was taking in transactions, helping customers and balancing books. Management was good but too disconnected from reality. Co workers are with you in the trenches and can be just as discouraged. At this point I can't think of one thing that was enjoyable about this job."
good,"Stable and established company to work for. Limited room for advancement, no bonuses and very limited employee engagement measures."
good,"PNC as a whole is still going through many changes as a company. While they are a heavy-hitter in the Financial sector, they do not top the list for places to work."
good,"No comment, adding a review will breach company confidentiality agreements."
good,"It feels like everyone is now micro managed. In pnc you either get no manager or you get a manager that is on a constant power trip as he tries to run his branch like it was his own family and try to disclipine and speak to their branch employees like kids. Theyll give you excuses as to how they care about your life. But in reality most managers make you feel guilty for taking your sick time. While they get to leave when ever they want to no control at all, you are stuck working your 40 hours"
good,The management and the cuture is not inclusive of all employees.  The cuture of PNC shifted to a sales based culture and not a customer focused culture with the management currently in place.
good,"Plenty of office politics, great opportunities, but there are potential land mines to navigate that can derail a career. Fall into the wrong project and you can be sidelined. They are the big fish in the market, so that makes it hard to negotiate salary once you’re hired. So negotiate upfront and be prepared to live with that decision. Good benefits, decent enough work/life balance for some, lots of overtime for others. For this I’d give it a mixed review. If you’re the right candidate, you can find your niche."
good,Staffing from management always implement moving up the ladder but in realistic world they don’t want you to go anywhere else in the company if your good at what your currently doing
good,Worked in collections for  4 years. The management constantly changed and know one thought of the real business needs to concerned with metrics and etc.
good,"The inside grocery store branch hours were a bit crazy and inflexible, they are open 7 days a week and late."
good,"The management at PNC is the worst I have ever experienced! I have never worked at a place where the manger talks down to her employees... even in front of other employees! She also talks ABOUT them behind their back! Going to work in the mornings is dreadfully . Throughout the day is just as bad. PNC’s HUMAN RESOURCE Department really needs to reevaluate their managers! ESPECIALLY the one at Lantana and Jog in Lake Worth, FL!!"
good,"-Little room for advancement. "
good,They just think clients are right all the time an if u speak ur option u get written up on top of they dont speak for their selfs. I wish i didnt quit because of the money but they stress u out there
good,PNC was a nice place to work. clean quiet environment and opportunity to work from home. Have to give it one star for job security because I was laid off due to cutbacks.
good,"Make decent money but the management doesn’t want you to advance and become better. You can have the best performance for the month and still can’t get the shift you want, the position you want etc. All they do is micromanage & be in your business."
good,"I was a Loan Closer with PNC I loved my boss, she did not micromanage, and she was encouraging.  The pay I received while I was there was a good pay rate per hour.  Job security however leaved much to be desired, they would cut anyone and everyone at the drop of a dime.  They would not even offer other positions within the company before getting rid of you.  Other than that it was a good experience."
good,"Nothing, but politics. All they care about are credit card sales, not the individuals they have working for them. If you come in from outside of PNC, your pay will be a lot better than being there for a long time and moving up. Only positive I have is maternity leave is 10 weeks + 6 weeks parental time."
good,Very busy.  Accolades given to the team time and time again but the raises don't match the performance.  Stated that it is merit based but it is not.  Often times punished for speaking up and the manager has favorites.  Making it obvious.
good,"PNC as a company is great, but the management in the regional I worked in was horrible.  Great people were being ley go for things that could have been coaching opportunities and kept employees that were committing acts that they should have been fired over and keeping them way too long."
good,"-Boasts flexible work hours but work overtime on a regular basis and are continuously told that they value home/work separation but expect you to come in early and stay late"
good,"No advancement outside of retail in my area,poor compensation for the hours worked,mandatory 6 day weeks two times a month as a manager. Work life balance needs to be revamped."
good,"Goals are unattainable and constantly changing. The company does a great job of paying top producers in incentive, but salaries are very low. Management only cares about widgets not what the client actually needs."
good,"PNC as a company has great benefits; Health, dental, vision, HSA, 401k, vacation time and sick pay. The mortgage industry can be very stressful. After an annual review, the raise was very minimal and less than 2% when meeting all expectations. Management lacks communication, micromanaging has significantly increased. The required ""minimum"" for the daily job is highly unobtainable. The amount of knowledge that is expected to perform the daily job, in addition to the stress of the nature of the position, blinded management, and the lack of compensation I feel is incredibly unfair. Morale is very low, I will admit, each person is accountable to uplift themselves and others, but PNC puts full responsibility of this on their employees, There are no, to maybe very tiny attempts from a ""corporation"" to value their employees."
good,Pnc Bank had the usual opportunities of working for  a large corporation. Banks are very unstable with mergers and job security. They required a high level of responsibility with very low salary compensation.
good,Process payments to borrower's loans who are in Loss Mitigation. Remove loans where signed documents or no payment have not been received. PNC offers employees to volunteer to assist preschool students is fun and develops the community.
good,"Two major issues with PNC Bank are; low salary and lack of career advancement. If you live in Pittsburgh, PA where the headquarters is located you have a better chance of advancing your career. However, if you are located in Philadelphia then the company is only an experience mill to help you gain experience for other financial companies. Even if you have a bachelors degree and try to advance from an Analyst I to an Associate I or II your application will be denied, mainly due to the company mainly wanting to hire from the outside and keep salaries low."
good,"PNC is a great bank as a customer.  They offer all the things retail banking customers are looking for.  As an employee, they were great to work for except for compensation.  We once had a meeting where the Regional VP was talking about different levels of accounts.  He said ""who doesn't have at least $2,000 direct deposits per month in their checking account"" (helps avoid monthly fees) and everyone in the training meeting raised their hand was like ""I don't even come close to $2,000/month in direct deposits"".  Showed how out of touch management was from their customer facing employees.  I believe PNC recently increased their minimum wage, but when I was there, it was below $10/hr.  They offer tons of incentives for referrals, but you were lucky to get one or two per day due to the emergence of online banking and most people making the switch from traditional means.  Overall great company.  Just don't work here if you are the only source of income in your family (more of a supplemental income position or for mom's re-entering the workforce)."
good,"the benefits and pay are great, and the flexible work arrangements are awesome, but that also leads to a lack in office culture. i never get to see the people i work directly with"
good,The CDB team is pretty flat with no room for advancement unless you are willing to relocate.  Very rewarding work in a very visible and flexible environment.  Expect pay to be less then competitors.
good,"I worked over 9 hours a day, sometimes 10. is too much work for what I get paid. the people I worked with are very nice team but the day is very long, is a 10 hour shift."
good,PNC is a good company with good people. Some of the working groups within the bank have opportunities to advance and grow. Other groups are stagnant or reducing in size and have very limited opportunities.
good,"Some of the managers are full of ego but the others are great. The salary is NOT nearly enough for the amount of stress and difficult customers you have to deal with, let alone a living wage. Yes, the health insurance, discounts, and the few paid days off are great. If they were to up the hourly wage to at least $16 the jobs would be worth it."
good,Nice people but very sales orientated  lot of pressure to sale felt like I was attacking people everyday with the same questions and offers even if they say no it is expected to ask over and over again.
good,PNC was a part time home job that I worked from home. I loved the clients and the job but PNC would never allow full time for that position. I learned a lot about online banking which helped me in my personal banking. Management changed a lot so sometimes you did not know who to call on if you needed help or had a question.
good,"Customer care center should have been a path to other positions within the company. You learn a lot about banking here and deal with customer over the phone, but the care center is dead end position. You can advance within the telephone center but outside of that it's impossible. You are on a tight schedule as they monitor your work time on the phone. And when I had scheduled time off to talk with HR, they missed my appointment twice. They offered little more than, ""Oh, I forgot."""
good,PNC is a nice place to work. They have a culture of flexibility to allow employees work from home as needed. Change is usually disruptive but meaningful.
good,"The everyday work life can be stressful depending on the department you are in. However, stressful as it may be, PNC is innovative in the way content and help is provided to its employees to ensure they receive any help needed to perform to the best of their abilities."
good,"If they promote within the people they are promoting are lazy and don't know anything about running a branch, audits, or training people. Managers put their work off on other people and if something that they were supposed to do doesn't get done they blame it on the team."
good,Not enough money for all the work they pile on you and management is terrible no room for advancement favoritism no variety same work everyday negative work environment
good,PNC is a great company. Their pay depends on how they feel when you enter. I came in requesting a certain amount and come to find out a teller was given a higher salary than me. Mind you I had experience and management experience under my belt. The hardest thing would have to be the different policies and procedures everyday. One person says one thing and the next a different. Nothing is set in stone so it puts you at risk. I love working here because it is fast paced. They do recognize you but not as much as you would like. I love my clients at work.
good,A lot of opportunity for growth with the most opportunity in their headquarters.  They provide flexibility in working from home depending on the department you work in.  They promote an inclusive environment.
good,"There is too much staff turnover, in banking in general, this bank was no exception.  Initially it was enjoyable, but as the branch model changed from traditional teller/banker assistance, to an en suite approach, I felt it was the wrong way to go, customers go to the bank for  reliable, traditional assistance, not to be interviewed at every visit."
good,PNC isn't a bad place to work if you can deal with the favoritism and politics. You grow with the company if you are in good with management. There is not an equal opportunity in growth unfortunately. Friends promote friends.
good,Once you are hired in you will not get very good raises at all.  The benefits are ok and the time off is good but for the most part the advancement doesn't exist.  If you're working in the bank for years someone can come in with no experience and make more than you do.
good,"Personal and Business deposits, Check cashing, preparing documents, selling, savings bonds, security boxes, Customer service. Maintaining and setting up accounts."
good,upper management encouraged calling clients multiple times a week even when they did not want to be contacted. Employees were constantly harassed if their clients were not sold on multiple items.
good,Great bank for growth and investment but poorly chosen managers. Highly stressful atmosphere but severely underpaid employees which results in a constant turnover.
good,I start my shift at 6:00 a.m. I have to verify check payments in a timely matter. Ensure the appropriate materials are with correct payments. The mot enjoyable part of my job is providing great accuracy and quality for our customers.
good,"I am a loan processor, I mange about 30- 35 mortgage loans at a time. I have learned a lot about the different loan programs available for refinance."
good,I have learned a lot of different processes relating to my specific job function. I have also had the opportunity to train others in the group on these processes.
good,"The job itself was great; I felt productive every day and was challenged to learn more about my role without feeling overwhelmed. However, the manager and supervisor would make last-minute changes to the schedule, changed their mind at the last minute about giving days off that were agreed upon months ago, and often would not adhere to important policies for the sake of convenience. I was with the company for a very short time and saw so many employees come and go during my time there because they were not willing to do anything for the employees."
good,"Come into work assist clients with any inquires on account. Check emails for follow ups with clients. Use leads as leverage to help drive revenue for yourself as well as the bank. Management can be very helpful at times. Co- workers are great. Hardest part of the job can be falling short of sales and trying to get back on pace, especially if traffic is slow. Most enjoyable part is when you assist a client and they walk out feeling great."
good,A typical day at my job consists of getting to my computer and clocking in also bringing up all the systems we use to locate people in our date base. Once thats done we log into the phone and start taking calls to help people with either fraud or disputes on their credit cards. I learned alot about credit cards and also alot about different disputes and their reasons. My coworkers were amazing and great people to be around.
good,I had to help others on my team with less experience due to our direct managers lack of leadership.  I was constantly answering questions of my co-workers which took time away from my responsibilities.
good,I enjoyed all departments i  worked in except the call center. I worked in various departments during my time there. Call center was the most demanding and most stress-full place. Pressure from supervisors and managers was to much along with the customers being nasty and mean.
good,"You are open to work at your own pace on your pipeline to meet monthly exceptions. With the role at the bank, you will learn loan processing and develop great customer service skills. The staff is very friendly and helpful towards each other to work as a team. The hardest part of the job may be all the different systems to preform duties, but once you master learning...you will manage to go back and forth very quick. The best part of the job, is that I actually get to reach out to customers to help save them money or help them with their hardship."
good,"PNC Bank does not work well at all with students. Do not like when students need different availability during fall even though you are part time. They are nice people when you say yes to everything, but once they see that you are busy and cannot say yes, they change."
good,PNC is a company that is ever evolving. The most enjoyable part of my day is helping the customer and my coworkers. The company encourages their employees to stay abreast on their procedures and policies to ensure that all government regulations are being followed.
good,"not much advancement, great co-workers, sometimes fun environment, ok pay, family atmosphere, pretty good working hours"
good,Company focuses on sales rather than relations. Provides great benefits. Great opportunity to gain experience with handling confidential information and client issues.
good,"Too much work, too much overtime. The company culture has changed in the past two years. Most people can't balance work and family."
good,"My position was placed inside of a supermarket where we would attempt to leverage banking needs to people buying their dinner, weekly groceries, or even their lunch - many failures existed and a lot of the opportunities were dead-leads. "
good,Hard to advance. Company does not allow to many internal employees to achieve to the next level often. It is not a company I would recommend anyone to work for.
good,"Managed a team of business to business professionals (BDO's) in the at work banking segment across Alabama, Florida Panhandle and Mid Georgia. Job duties included hiring, coaching and developing direct staff in addition to training support mechanism. Supported in field progress through high level presentations and coaching observations."
good,"I was over worked at PNC. I learned a lot, however there was more work then I was able to keep up with. The management was not very forgiving, nor willing to help. There was only one POC for the work that was being done, so getting answers to questions was very hard."
good,"The job is simple to perform. On assigned nights I make parts, or Quality Inspect Parts and sometimes even fill in for the shift supervisor. Job is easy but very repetitive. I have learned a lot in being able to start machines up and do small odd jobs on machines such as performing wire changes and terminal changes and making other adjustments to make sure parts are being made to meet customer requirements and satisfaction."
good,"I wish I could say I had a great experience here, the pay is so low, others continually left to go to other banks because the pay is higher virtually everywhere. Management was terrible, possibly just my Branch I don't know."
good,The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the turnover. When management change then you have to change.
good,"While they have fabulous benefits, the whole nature of the job is centered around sales. If you are a salesmen this is a good job for you."
good,"Good place to work, that's why I'm searching for another position?"
good,"I learned various clerical duties, item processing."
good,I worked in the mortgage department. It's either feast or famine and it was famine for me. The laid me and 59 other people off. Management consists of many different styles but my manager micromanaged so much so that I suffered in advancement.
good,The job was monotonous. Management was not helpful and very partial. Co-workers where great to work with.
good,"Every day I bring new opportunities to use my sales experience, and product and procedural knowledge, as I work to identify the individual financial needs of our customers, and recommend PNC products and services that meet those needs. "
good,"A great team player environment. Overall experience is good , a typical day at work is busy and many meetings to attend."
good,PNC as a whole has it's problems. Treats it's employees horribly and doesn't care one bit about it's customers. All the benefits that they tell you about the company are mostly for Pittsburgh employees only. Management is the worst! Never giving any news and NEVER there to help!! Always getting to some sort of trouble example; having customers on hold for to long waiting for a department to help you. Not selling enough. They do have an AMAZING training program I learned a lot. It would have been better if the computers worked.
good,I like that they still have a free checking account. Now a days you don't find free checking accounts.
good,Production goals are set in a way that it's next to impossible to make incentive pay. Management uses the fear of losing your job if you do not reach monthly quotas. Forced overtime is common practice with the underwriting staff.
good,PNC by far offers the best technology and digital channels to its clients. Has a unique branch layout of universally all team members are able to assist clients
good,"This is a good place to work if you don’t have children or a family. Due to high turn over, managers have to fill in scheduling gaps making it difficult to balance work and home life."
good,"When i first started working for PNC, I was so excited. But over time, I realized that development for new hires or staff period was non existent. I work really hard to achieve my goals and still don't get paid what other banks pay."
good,"stressful environment with multitasking. Management needs to improve, only cares about their numbers. Definitely need better manager who also has interest in their employees success."
good,Start off checking prior and current day emails from our service partners. Then open excel to prepair the Daily spreasheet containing our IDDAs. Next would come time for the teams morning Huddle. Then back to working the entries up to the 2pm deadline.
good,"Being a branch manager here is beyond stressful. New things constantly added and expected to still run a branch and somehow put customers first. Needs better communication and how information is relayed to employees. When i present and issue looking for help on a solution, I do not get help."
good,"The ability to work remotely was a huge benefit, but career advancement seemed hard to attain. Base compensation seemed low and turned incentive pay into a necessity."
good,"PNC is an okay place to work. I've been able to advance my career over the years and have worked in many departments. Some departments and managers have great work like balance and direct manager support, others do not. Internal hires make significantly less than external hires even with comparable experience."
good,"Difficult to navigate the political relationships there. Felt some were petty and antagonistic."
good,"As long as you don't mind working with a bunch of biggetts or uneducated cultural, mindless people. Then it's the best place to work. I spent  2 years dealing with a moron of a supervisor  that I was consistently contacting HR for. They believe in supporting management not employees you  will not have a fair opportunity. PNC management needs to be more involved with how their employees feels."
good,"Great office environment, direct supervisor very responsive but hands were tied by upper management.  The constant changing of P&P created a lot of turmoil between the Analysts and QA, which caused production issues."
good,Overall I thought that PNC was a good place to work.  The people there are wonderful and friendly.  The department that I work in had very helpful people.
good,This company is driven only by meeting sales goals and expects you to hit unrealistic goals. Your job performance is sometimes skewed because of third parties in the company not doing their jobs in a timely manner.
good,It seems with this company if you do less than your job is described you are bowed down to. But for those who pick up the slack of others and bust their butts you don't get ahead instead you are treated like garbage.
good,most enjoyable part of the job are the clients and co workers.   The issues are that management is unclear about it's place in the retail world.  Unable to balance fee generation vs services offered and chooses not to compete with regional competitors.
good,I started my career at PNC as an intern.  The company has a great internship program and a great trainee program.  The management team was engaging and encouraging.
good,"Overall good place, pay is not the best, benefits could def be better. But time off is pretty good. I would recommend them but they still could use work."
good,"Working at PNC as just ok.  My day consisted of new account reviews, coaching my direct reports, training employees, handling customer complaints, reviewing transactions for errors and mitigating risk.  "
good,"Overall there are a lot of good people at PNC.  Some of the higher up management doesn't have a grasp of what is actually going on.  They ""sell"" their new products to higher management, and bring in outside workers from prior employment to push their new products along.  It's not allowing current employees a chance to learn and grow."
good,"This company did not offer enough full time positions at the time I worked there."
good,I thought I would be at PNC until I retire. Not after I realized that I have hardly rec any raises in the last 4 years. The job is very stressful and very high expectations.
good,products don't meet all client segmentations and are not competitive in the market place. client website offers a good tools for clients but like many firms it is a widget environment.
good,"When I started in 2004, it was a great place to work, slowly over the years, especially since 2013, things changed.  New leadership from other banks, lack of promotions from within, hiring people from outside the bank."
good,"From sales goals to customer service scores, it was nearly impossible to get a ""meets expectations"" score on the annual performance review."
good,"PNC is a good place to work while you are in school, most departments you can make your weekly schedule so it makes it flexible.  The breaks are short and the calls can be very stressful. However, the pay is pretty good."
good,PNC's culture changed in the time I was there from an employee friendly corporation to more of a financially driven business.  I would return to work there as there was a 400 million dollar cutback with mass layoffs and retail store closings.
good,Depending on what area you work in it can be a fun place to work.  But if you want to develop and advance in your job look for another place to work.  this is not the place for someone looking to move up
good,always understaffed and only focus on what can be better rather than the 50 things you bust your butt to do daily. Never take into account how difficult learning new things on the fly can be and treat you like a machine.
good,"My days consisted of working closely with my bank partners.  One on one coaching around how to recognize an opportunity for a bank client to meet with me for a consultation.  Management was very hands on and supportive and wanted the advisors to be successful.  The hardest part of the job was to keep my bank partners focused and motivated.  Once I received a qualified referral, I truly enjoyed understanding and learning about the client's financial circumstances and needs.  I looked forward to educating  clients about different investment products and why what I proposed made the most sense based on their individual financial position.."
good,"I think my review may be biased due to the management I worked under during my time at PNC. Unfortunately that manager was rude, unethical and quite literally verbally abusive to their staff. The team I worked with was excellent though - very hard working, friendly, supportive of one another. "
good,"They care more about making sales calls like telemarketers then their employees. When you work in a branch where you have the same customers all the time it is hard to sell them different products. Or offer them products were they receive perks and then take those perks away. You are told to do things one way by one higher up and then another way by another department. Its conflicting. They want you to be 10 people and pay you for 1. They don't want to hire more employees but blame you for customer wait time, bad surveys, drop in goals etc."
good,"If you're starting off this is a good place, but if you have experience I wouldn't recommend it. Pay wasn't the best, the health benefits are terrible. Unhealthy work environment, but they do give a decent amount of vacation days."
good,"very slow production, lack of management people,"
good,"I'm very neutral about PNC as a place to work. As with all companies it depends on the area you work in. The call center often gives the wrong information when you call to seek advice which often is at odds with advice from management. Information does not always filter down to you so you find out the hard way, that you made a mistake and are held accountable. Senior management are too busy sitting in their ivory towers, making decisions which impact branch staff, without consulting the staff. They also have no idea about what is going on at branch level as they rarely, if at all, visit the branches. The job culture is extremely conservative & makes it hard to properly assist customers."
good,"the management at the branch I was placed was horrible. I was never trained in the branch. There's no direction or guidance at all. I learned through trial and error. The day moves pretty slow and many tasks aren't that hard but all the inside information, like rules and policies, and branch codes and safety wasn't taught to me and is essential for doing the job. Which makes my job harder. Also the hours were terrible for a part time worker"
good,The managers interviewed prospective underwriters based on word of mouth without actually determining if they were a good fit for the position.  Bonus program is difficult to achieve as there is not enough work available.
good,"For many years with PNC Wealth Management I felt accomplished and very proud to work for a corporation that cared about the employees and clients. Unfortunately, the company changed policies and management where I could no longer be a part of the undesirable changes."
good,Depending on what region the branch is in depends on how the everyday life will go. They will try to help you build your career. Not the best when it comes to compensation.
good,They get you in with the great benefits but have poor training in place for new hires and for new systems that are updating. Very little to no advancement if you have no degree even with knowledge and experience.
good,"The day to day work is fine, however PNC is a very conservative bank, which makes it difficult for individuals to meet sales goals and receive their commissions. Salary is also very low in comparison to other banks"
good,It was nice pay but the amount of work and training you go through without more pay is quite extensive. The grading scale is quite outrageous as well depending on who is monitoring your calls. Some are lenient some are extremely over bearing and unrealistic.
good,"Poor communication lead to confusion and often frustration about job responsibilities.  Little recognition for excellent performance. "
good,The associates are great to work within the site. The compensation needs to improve.The management sometime can be overwhelming. The work place culture is enjoyable.
good,"I was hired at PNC Bank as a contract employee. My contract was to consist of 3 months with possibility of conversion to Full Time status. I was first extended at the end of my 3rd month for an additional 3 months. Then, extended again for another 3 months. Totaling 9 months."
good,"It is more about who you know versus what you know.  People with no experience and education are promoted versus someone with experience or education, because of who they know.  Benefits are terrible.  You need a second job to pay for the high deductible insurance plans."
good,"Found myself subject to a ""Probation Period"" with no guidance.  Some passive-aggressive attitudes seem designed to derail success and productivity.  Vague direction from leadership and a lot of course corrections."
good,Reviewed and produced commercial documentation via Laser Pro and Capital Stream documentation systems.  Enjoyed the challenge of completing accurate loan documentation.
good,Management talks much about how they support their employees and want them to succeed but when you reach out to grow within the industry they do nothing for you.
good,You can't get out of retail. They want to keep you there. Can't advance and they pay sub par. Trying to actively get out. Micromanagement. There was a lack of leadership in their mass affluent program.
good,"Due to high turnover and an inability to hire enough qualified employees to accomplish the workload, it makes for a stressful atmosphere to work in. It is a good company overall, just poorly managed at the mid to low levels."
good,"Good company to work for to start off, the pay is good and there are several incentives but management is very unprofessional they lack good communication in several areas."
good,"I was part of a bank that was acquired by PNC. Subsequently, I left PNC. The bank is great for people that need to be managed constantly. PNC is very rigidly structured and you know exactly how to arrange your desk and what should be worked on at what time of the day. If you are in need of structured guidance, PNC is the place for you."
good,"The work experience isn't great but not bad either."
good,Not much chance for advancement. The benefits are ok but the pay leaves much to be desired.  Management could definitely use some people skills.  Not the worst place to work but not the best either.
good,I started my career in banking here.  It was a good place to work with good people.  They are also no longer in business due to the mortgage crash of 2008.
good,"The position is a challenging one. not only are you accountable for the job daily financial operations of managing a bank you are also required to make monthly sales goals, have outstanding customer service skills. ( you are evaluated on a weekly base on survey customers take)"
good,"Constantly having to fix other peoples mistakes when a slight bit of attention to detail would have prevented it. I love to work, but find I don't actually get to do much of it. There are times when I am focused and all my co workers want to do it talk about recipes. There is a time and place for everything, When I am at work, I want to make money, not sit around with my girlfriends and discuss what were doing that night."
good,"They are letting great employees go when they challenge lack of strategy to win. They say they are a tech leader, but they are not. The word collaboration does not exist in retail banking."
good,"Great place to work, however, management could use some more training in communication. The incentive program which his based on your performance is great."
good,Pnc was a good bank to work for until they bought all these banks and know they are getting to big for themselves.  My co workers are nice and everybody gets along.
good,I worked as a call center representative in it's member services department. I spent most of my days on the phone speaking and assisting customers.
good,"PNC Equipment Finance offers limited room for advancement.  The training is very minimal and you have to be able to learn on your own. No set guidelines or procedures you just have to figure it out as you go along.  Some area's of the business such as Documentation are always under staffed and over worked.  This area is very high stress with no relief in sight.  They have silo mentality between business units. It is very rare that knowledge is shared between business units.  Thinking outside of the box is some what discouraged.  It depends on your personality whether or not you would like PNCEF as a place to work.  If you like to just come in and do your task and go home then you will love it, but it your a self motivated, problem solver this is not somewhere you will be happy."
good,"The big company that treats you like a number not a person. Good Place to get experience, but not a place to stay. They provide the tools you need to advance with in the company but that's it."
good,The company doesn't focus on the things that are important and treats there employees like children who need threatened with punishment to perform.  The needs of clients have changed and this company does not keep up with the way people choose to do business and the employees are left making up the difference.
good,Great starter job not much room for growth. High turnover in key positions and disconnect between managers and customer facing employees. The culture is relaxed and laid back but sometimes that's a negative.
good,The company has its struggles in the mortgage department. I believe they can do a better job with associate work life balance.
good,There are a lot of managers that are not very nice and do not talk to associates. PNC tries to promote employee engagement but it doesn't go very far when the Management team seems out of touch with the associates. The talent seems to leave either due to the management team or due to compensation.
good,"I worked for PNC for a short time, but because they don't have a local presence it felt like we were out on an island. Othewise very typical bank experience."
good,"I worked for PNC for many years and through the years, I could see that the culture was changing as the bank was growing. The focus was more on sales and less on employee engagement. To me, it is important to work for a company who values their employees just as much as their revenue because we are the frontline individuals who are helping the bank grow and prosper through our every day interactions with clients."
good,"decent place to work, pay is lower than competitor financial institutions, working Saturdays were acceptable until they went to extended hours"
good,Provide wonderful customer service to many different cultures in Southern Maryland. We even have Amish and horse and buggies. Loved the customers dispite so many change overs in management.
good,always looking over your shoulder micro managing management. The days off/flexibility not great. Bankers should not be broke and not able to get a personal loan or day off while expected to smile and offer credit and loans to people. pay more. be more.
good,"Manage portfolio of Banking clients.  Work to uncover new opportunities while managing current pipeline."
good,"Management is not the easiest to work with, the most enjoyable part of the job was the customers."
good,PNC Mortgage was your typical mortgage environment. It was a place that employed dedicated and hard working individuals. It provided the proper training that you needed to excel in your position. Your managers were also making sure that you needs were met and had high quality communication skills.
good,"Customer Service"
good,"Working for PNC mortgage was not completely bad. Myself I don't agree with their ethics or upper managements view of those below them. There really wasn't much a person could do to add a novel idea to the company. The hardest part of the job was basically trying to deal with many irate customers and co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job, at the time, was the pay honestly."
good,"Begin my day with morning duties regarding setting up my station with the cashbox, logging into the system and preparing my station for the work day. I perform the night deposit duty as well as making a check up on the amount that is in the ATM I service. I then begin to inspect the rest of the branch in order to make sure we are ready for to open and proceed with the day. Once the branch was open i proceeded to either help the tellers process transactions at my own station or proceed with lobby engagement in helping the customers with either helping them write out deposit slips, withdrawal slips or attend any questions or concerns they may have had. I also would cross-sell products that would help improve their financial well being so that they understood everything that the bank had to offer to them so they could fully utilize all the products at their disposal. I was able to learn how to cross sell products while also servicing the customers at the best possible ability while also learning how to engage with them to open up information to helping them better bank with us. The majority of the team was brand new so management was a little lackluster but we have a great manager in our branch who is very helpful and involved in our growth. For the most part the co workers are good to work with though a much more family environment could help run the place smoother. However the most enjoyable part of the day is when we are able to relax and have fun within the bank on slow or fast days as we like to please the customers where they aren't just coming into a bank and being quickly"
good,"Bank Teller is a job that is very different than any job I've ever had before. You must maintain a positive attitude, well spoke and knowing your product."
good,"Busy day everyday process check balancing, etc."
good,"- What I have learned is not to trust branch managers."
good,"i like that i had sales goals to meet which kept me motivated, management wasn't the best but it was a job."
good,"some parts and days are great some are harder than others. Lot of the hard part is the market some is self inflicted by the company. overall its alright every place has good, bad interesting things going on."
good,"For the amount of daily responsibilities and the overall workload, PNC is known to pay below the expected/respected amount. The management is lazy and barely ever held accountable for mistakes, slacking, ect, but they come down so hard on normal employees for absolutely anything. I've worked in both the corporate and retail sides of this company. If you're interested, I recommend corporate (customer service, collections, data entry) because the retail employees (bankers, tellers, ect) get treated with far less respect. On the corporate side there is a great sense of ""togetherness"" amongst the team, there are company picnics, sporting events, outings, volunteer opportunities, free stuff and giveaways all the time and it's just a great, fast paced environment. I had to leave because the work life balance is simply not there on the corporate side. Overall, pretty decent place to work for. It definitely has it's flaws and could be improved more...but that's almost any job."
good,"Overall, this was a basic office enviornment with a chance to progress within the company.  The managment had an open door policy and I liked the pace of this job."
good,Daily routine consists of managing the workflow production floor of over 50 employees in a high paced environment.  I have learned to multitask duties to obtain optimum performance off employees in order to meet customer deadlines.  Hardest part of my job is to gain the confidence of my fellow employees which takes time as well as learning to use the correct people skills with each individual employee.  Most enjoyable part of my job would be each day gaining more knowledge of what I do.  Example learning more of the system and trouble shooting problems.  I believe the more empowdered you are the strong you are for your employees.
good,"PNC is a really great company, but the management in the Central Ohio area for retail banking is awful. Management seems to drive away top talent due to unnecessary micro management. Very challenging to get a salary increase even if you are a top producer."
good,A typical day of work would consists of begging customers to do something they don't want to do.
good,I managed 30-40 employees every quarter with quality call monitors. I learned an extensive of amount of knowledge regarding and paying attention to details. I was selected to head up the Gallup surveys and hold refresher courses for new training. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the inconsistencies of information from one department to another. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting and teaching the people I managed.
good,The people who have worked for the company longer tend to get there way over new comes.
good,This was a difficult company to navigate. Not very employee friendly.
good,The hardest part of the join is the keep balanced the fine line between banking requirements and investment expectation. Managers do not contribution to branch goals and are not held accountable.
good,"A typical day at work is fast pace and fun for the most part, I've learned different techniques in the banking industry, I have yet to proceed to the management level still preparing for that with help from"
good,While I did enjoy the type of work that I performed I felt that the Management didn't encourage atonomy and lacked consistent communication.
good,"I was a peak-time teller so I had up to 20/wk. My branch was nice to work at. Because I was peak-time, I had no benefits. They really worked with their employees and helped them to succeed!!"
good,"I would come in pass out work. Sign macros, answer questions. Help open work for distrubution. Attend meetings, Conduct meetings. Key checks, Correct transactions. End of the night audits and reports. The most enjoyable was the people. The hardest part of the job was lack of people to do the job."
good,"After nearly 5 years, and PNC reporting record earnings, I've not received more than a 1.5% increase and it's the only job I've ever had with no bonus dispute the fact that in each yearly review I'm told the I ""exceed expectations """
good,"The recruiter that offered me the job stated to me, and I recorded it, that i would only be working a couple nights a week and mostly during the day the latest i would work on a day shift would be 7:30 pm. THAT WAS A TOTAL LIE!! I have been working until 10 pm every night, it has stressed my family out to where they cant take it anymore that they never see me but for a couples hours here and there EVEN when I work from home. My cable bill and such almost tripled because i have to have the high internet and home phone, and they dont offer any kind of perks for that."
good,Call center is a very high stress environment with lots of quotas. The interview was deceptive with regard to how much you would make and actual opportunities for advancement. The call rating system is very critical and sometimes belittling.  Upper management does not care about the feedback from call center employees.
good,"Expect to deal with customers that can be angry, due to their own miss-management of money, on a regular basis. High pressure sales environment, and some management practices encourage and foster a hostile work environment."
good,Management is difficult to work with. Push products and meet numbers of the products to get quarterly bonus. No Christmas party or other corporate events. Continuing training and meetings are not close to office. Turn over very high.
good,"This place is a joke!! There in NO room for advancement!! The management is absolutely terrible, upper management does nothing to support the staff. HR & Ethics is a bunch of bologna. Don’t take anything into consideration, automatically sides with the NEWLY employed manager from BOA whom always puts down her employees and talks about them to other employees... one bad customer service survey will put you in the red for the whole year and that is held against you for any raises or promotions! I should know! I had 18 shops! 17 perfect and ONE not!! Can’t make them all happy!! But it was held against me and I was told that I needed to make an action plan to better my client experience! Save yourself the headache! My co-workers, including myself dread going to work everyday! It was never like this prior! We all enjoyed the place we worked! The keep hiring BOA manager who is trying to turn this place into BOA!"
good,I enjoyed working for this company.  I had to move out of state for family reasons and they were generous enough to move my employment to remote status.  I was so very grateful tat they allowed me to work from home.
good,"Work is challenging with customers who do not want to be sold to, and yet we are required to sell to them. Will lose job if we don't get required sales and performance numbers. My main issue with this is that we say we focus on customer service, but really we focus on selling to the customer whether that is in their best interest or desire, or not. Also felt misled because interview seriously downplayed how huge sales would be, so I felt upset when I started and saw the actual requirements as opposed to what was discussed in interview."
good,"I truly enjoyed the customer's that I worked with at PNC, However the Management that I worked under were less than great. "
good,"PNC for many employee levels allows flexiblw work arrangements.  This is swapped for the need to have to work most nights due to many meeting during working hours for the 1LOD risk areas.  However, the culture is casual and collaborative so the extra work is usually worth the effort."
good,"Process overload no work life balance. Management struggles with Sr. Management, lots of ideas and no plan to get there.  Peers were great and willing to share informaltion."
good,You can learn a lot by working for a large company; however something gets lost along the way when you are only a number. Some big companies have mastered how to make you feel valued and others just see you as a number.
good,Employees have the option to work from home or work in the office in an open workspace. The pay is low and benefits are below average compared to other verticals.
good,"Management would take sales comments and stereo type employees based on sales, without getting to know the work ethics of the employees gearing work to others to make employees appear not being able to meet goals."
good,They overwork you and do not pay what the job is worth. And if you make a mistake it is not their fault. Advancement is not so easy here. They exploit their workers. They will never fired you unless they have a good reason to not have to pay unemployment.
good,"Unless you are in Pittsburgh, there’s not much advancement. In Retail Bank, they have taken away individuals’ style and techniques that make us unique. We are all robots to them, having to learn their way to sell and make calls. It has become too much. The sales pressure has now become too much and the fun is gone."
good,"Lots of hard work with little recognition."
good,"HR made it impossible for a current PNC employee to get a better paying job upon graduation from college because the pay jump was too great.  They kept people from moving up, which increased their turnover rates."
good,"After spending 11 years at PNC I enjoyed my duties and my coworkers.  I was grandfathered in to continue to participate in the pension plan, a 401k with matching was also offered.  Health benefits were much better in the past, however still glad to have the benefits. Overall its a decent workplace. There are several lines of business in banking and it takes time to find the right position to feel comfortable in and excel in with the right leadership and management backing you. This is my opinion and experience only."
good,This is a work place where things get done but it  can be very difficult at times depending on the task. Although this is so things still get done by the end of the day.
good,"Job in the branches is now more like telemarketing position.  Have to make outbound calls to try and get customers back in the branch for ""financial well being checkup""  i.e. come in so we can sell you stuff."
good,"The culture here is very open to diversity and inclusion.  Along with development of employees to move ahead and be promoted."
good,At times it’s not a bad place to work for. Other times you better watch your back because they will terminate jobs right and left if they can get away with it.
good,"I've had great experiences and not so great experiences, company lacks consistency from the top to bottom, in retrospect communication wasn't always clear."
good,"Goal oriented, many tasks to complete in short time. Many functions, great customer service, fast learning requirements. Answering and making daily goals sales phone calls."
good,"Great work life balance if you are in the correct department. This is dependent upon your manager. "
good,"In general benefits are fine, but management expects excessive hours during the week, including weekends."
good,"work was repetitive. everyday we came in and did the exact same thing. Nobody had fun we weren't even allowed to talk and or have conversations like other departments. Nobody wanted to participate in the fun activities the "" enthusiastic employees"" tried to push for. The colleges either talked about you and made it comfortable or was blatantly rude and did not care. Other than that, yeah work was fine unless you wanted a raise or advancement."
good,PNC is a good company to work for however there is little room for advancement. I often did not feel valued or supported by management. There was little recognition for exceptional performance.
good,"Not a bad company to work for, but there was a lot of manager turnover. The systems were in place, but processing was not very efficient. The regional manager resigned a few weeks prior to me and the branch manager resigned the same day I did."
good,Moving toward a micro management culture with high pressure sales.  Limited advancement outside of retail.  Branch daily life is focused on sales activities and setting appointments with existing clients.
good,"I had the absolute WORST manager I think was even possible. At one point she had told one of the girls that I had worked with that she didn't like her outfit that day and that she looked ""like she belonged on a corner somewhere"". The pay was okay. Nothing special."
good,I was a MLO. At the time I worked there processing was a issue. My manager at the time went out on a leave right after I started and I had no support. They offered good products but no support.
good,Managers steal work from personal bankers. Overstaffed due to multiple branch closings and lack of clientele. Low pay compared to industry standards and training is a joke.
good,"PNC has lost it's culture and is continually changing over its management team.  My career there was great, but the culture changed to one that had no appreciation of its employees.  In fact, I was embarrassed to deliver compensation discussions because the bonus and merit raises were so poor."
good,"The job isn't that bad there's just a lot to know and learn but I feel my experience at PNC has been tainted because of a poor manager. It can definitely be a high stress job due to the many things that you must look out for and the people you encounter. However, the pace, stress level, and atmosphere of the branch depends on the location. I've worked at a branch where they see a hand full of customers for the entire 8 hours and I've worked in a branch, such as mine, that can be very busy and almost everyone has a problem. You are expected to provide a very high level of service to customers and you must show up at 110% to work everyday. A good experience to have and a great resume builder but not for everyone."
good,"I worked for PNC lockbox as an operations specialist for nearly ten years.  I enjoyed my job overall, and was happy with my work.  The issues that I encountered were the increasing amount of work without any increased pay also my manager hovered and watched every move that I made along with others. I get that, that was a part of his job, but most adults do not like to be micro managed.  For example, my bathroom time down to the seconds was clocked. It is a high paced production environment, but certain things like relieving your bladder should not be managed.  Also so much negative emphasis would be placed on one error rather than the 1000+ correct things you've already entered.  I learned a lot and I respect that job for my growth; with that being said, I am so glad that I left.  My pay has increased, I am no longer being micromanaged, and I meet all of my deadlines on time with no issues.  Also If I happen to make a mistake, my supervisor talks to me with respect to remedy any concerns. I no longer feel like my livelihood is threatened with each error."
good,"Good company to work for, as long as your not a teller in a retail bank. With the amount of responsibilities you have as a teller, the hourly rate dose not justify the risk."
good,"No room for FT highers (if contracted). Remote work is great, in office is not stimulating, very desolate -everyone on the team sits in Pittsburgh (remote office is in Cincinnati)."
good,"At PNC, you need to make sure you are constantly keeping in contact with external referrals. They will be very important to your overall success. Do not rely on internal business."
good,"I started at PNC after talking with a recruiter about advancement opportunities. I took a lower entry position knowing that I would be completing my MBA in the near future. The job description is misleading. You are forced to take trainings and back up for other departments which were not included in your job position. No advancement has taken, even though I have over exceeded all company goals in place for my position. I have place many different applications to different positions over the past 2 years with no avail. It should be noted that my department has an extremely high turnover rate."
good,I learned so much about bank operations and client services. I enjoyed my role as teller supervisor and fully intended to strive to advance my career in banking with PNC. If not for the personal issues I had with the management I would recommend this job to others.
good,This was a fast-paced job required to sell checking/savings accounts and also performing teller functions.  I learned to put myself out there and sell to people.  Management was highly concerned with selling and not so much the customer.  Hardest part of the job was having to sell a product to people who were grocery shopping.  The most enjoyable part of the job were the people I worked with and benefits.
good,"It is very hard to move up within PNC, not much help in terms of guidance and development from managers. Education does not play a role in seeking career advancement."
good,"The job is good, just that the hours are very longggg! You come in the morning and you do not leave until when it's very dark outside. The pay is very low too for all the work we do."
good,Hard place to work for. As the company grows employee benefits decrease. Not a work life balance. Pnc values new employees more than senior employees.  It’s truly unfortunate
good,"not the best not the worst but pay wise not anything to talk about.health benefits also were horrible and commission structure isn't the best, only good t get your foot into the banking industry"
good,"Very typical sales culture of ""what have you done for me lately."" Difficulty keeping branches staffed with quality employees, very high turnover rate inside the locations made hitting goals tough."
good,"I was hired in July of 2016 and on January 12th of 2017 we were all informed via a phone call that they were eliminating the Financial Specialist program as of April 21st."
good,"The hardest part of this role is the on-the-job training experience for handling the sales and service sides of a branch store. You attend 3-5 day training workshops periodically to learn all about sales. However, there is not much preparation for handling scenarios in which you would need to provide services to customers."
good,"Inbound and outbound calls to customers to verify  credit an debit card activity. "
good,Sales pressure from regional managers.They will make sure to trigger a sale out of you no matter if what the proper guidelines when applying for a product for the customer.
good,"As a Teller you are totally underpaid for the amount of work you do, while waiting on customers and putting your life on the line. Don't settle for the low rate of pay. It's not worth it."
good,instead of offering  more traing or allowing you to switch to a new manager while in training knowing there were issues between you and the managre they just let you go and then they black ball you from applying  for 6 months and other people wont give you the time of day in an interview  because your reseaning for being let go is its just not gonna work...
good,Mandatory 50 hours a week.  the company took on too much too fast.  Extremely stressful because peoples livelihood was at stake.  Not enough training!
good,"It's a good job but you work your butt off and you don't get what you deserve, I'm a full time student and sacrifice so much for my job. I wanted to get a promotion and was told that I wasn't good enough. My job is stressful because I took on a lot of responsibility and management still didn't care. In order to move up in the company you have to kiss everyone's butt."
good,"Stressful environment, PNC want you to promote products to customers that can't afford them. Very poor management. People left because of management.."
good,"Post Wells Fargo, the retail bank senior management has made things more difficult.  Too much Micromanaging from the top down. There is overkill in tracking behaviors and results."
good,It would be a better place to work if the culture encouraged growth within the company versus bringing in management from outside the company.  Some position there are glass ceilings also.
good,More fun activities should be there. There should be more team interactions. Work environment should be a bit spacious not congested. People needs seats to sit rather then putting them in corner places along the walls. Managers getting the major room portions with separate cabin. Consider all employees as humans.
good,"The employees are great, the work is doable, no major problems but no room for advancement no matter what you know.  No raises comfortable to your knowledge, really very little raise at all  if any."
good,"Where I am working, it's very stressful and on top of that, management isn't as helpful and we are always short-staffed. I've been belittled as if I'm not doing my job correctly which I am. I just wish management would work with me and my supervisor knew how to lead without yelling."
good,"The company is a great company. They embrace diversity. However, depending on the Branch, the management and employees can be very challenging. The environment can be full of gossip, back biting and judgement. It's too bad because the company is a really good one."
good,Maintained friendly and professional customer interactions.
good,"In the corporate environment, the higher up you go, the more competitive it gets, even though the company itself tries to promote diversity and recognition. I suppose this could hold true for many companies. I have little knowledge of what working for the retail side of the bank is like, however."
good,Call center environment with high turnover. Decent pay but micromanagement by managers. Not a bad place to work. Forced to sit in your desk from 9-5.
good,"Pros: "
good,"The location of the branch i worked at had an average amount of foot traffic, however only regulars came in on a day to day basis which left little chance to make referrals of establish new accounts. My manager was very rude and did not know how to preform any of the task of her employees."
good,"Company focus has recently changed with some positives, many negatives. With time, the company will resolve it's internal struggle in implementing the changes it needs to make for the future. "
good,"Great Culture, diverse company to work for. No competitive wages and opportunity for advancement. The most important part of this job is to be sure there is open lines of communication."
good,3 stars. PNC is a growing institution and open minded to the forever changing banking world but at the expense of its employees
good,Again met a lot of people walking around and meeting customers.  Found hardworking employees who I've brought with me to other jobs.  Very busy and always moving and keeping up on financials.
good,"Unprofessional, supervisors play favorites and the only way to move up is if they like you personally. The atmosphere was fun, games and contests kept you entertained."
good,The Company was a good place to work. There was no room for advancement. I loved helping people and empowering them to have more control of their financial life.
good,"I love the job, just hate lack of team work. We all have a task here to complete and we can not do it with a (I) in team. Everyone is responsible for different tasks and if there is room to help others then we do so when necessary"
good,"Goals and objectives are constantly changing, very little opportunity for advancement and incentive compensation is not competitive."
good,"While PNC can be flexible in most situations with work-life balance and setting work schedules, they do not seem to care about retaining good employees. I have seen many great employees leave over the last couple of years because of compensation. Employees for the most part, are not compensated competively and even when people receive promotions, they are sometimes still not receiving even a one dollar increase in salary."
good,"As I have worked for several banks the typical day and operations are generally the same."
good,"You are a retail banker, which means you are there to push products and give quality customer service so your location can get compensation for it. Work load is very light and the opportunity to advance is very high if you are willing to work for it."
good,"Considering the above, recent corporate structure changes have made me seriously consider leaving PNC.  While at PNC, I have gained a lot of knowledge and experience."
good,Great business and I've grown a lot within the organization. They do needs better security and wish they can attend the needs to help all the branches in all the regions.
good,"As far as my department it was like the blind leading the blind, busy all the time and under staffed.I learned a lot working there. Management didn't like you asking questions. My co-workers they were fun to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with fellow co-workers and different clients."
good,PNC is a great place to work. I enjoy what the company does for the staff and I love working for the same company for the past 23 years but I am looking for a change to use my Human Resource Degree.
good,"the management changed to frequently. and not supported at times, goals were to strong at times even when clientele was very slow."
good,"Good place to work at but not amazing,,,benefits and compensation are pretty much standard ..with the industry not super competitive..."
good,"Teller processing fast paced, check cashing, deposits issue monetary instruments (cashiers checks, money orders etc). Supervise branch team members, maintain branch scheduling, order of branch supply needs."
good,The Pay is horrible for the positions. You spend years working your way up and still make nothing compared to other banks.
good,A typical day for me consists of early morning conference calls followed by outside sales activation. Everyday my work location varies based on events scheduled for the week. I've learned how to juggle personal sales goals and management of a sales force including relationship building within a large market. Management doesn't seemed to be aligned with customer facing employees throughout the market which is a key factor in me seeking new employment. There is a very high turnover of employees in the company which makes it difficult to establish best practices that lead to positive results. The hardest pat of my job is having to deal with so many different personalities without any real support from my direct management. Philadelphia is the largest market in the company and I'm equipped with a team of four to meet the demands of such a large network. The best part of my job is that I am not tied down to any office as I am part of a mobile team. I love the freedom to create my own schedule and the opportunity to travel and experience different types of events.
good,"PNC is not a bad company to work for. The benefits are, in fact, rather exceptional, with health, vision, dental, and even a 401(k) plan matching at 4%. A lot of times, however, it does appear that upper management seems to be running in circles. I work in the branch in downtown Mechanicsburg where our regional manager's office resides, so you'd think they'd have a more keen sense on what's going on - they don't. Our regional manager is up a flight of stairs no more than 10 steps, and he JUST learned my name a few weeks ago - I got hired in February and it's now the end of October."
good,Great team to work with. Overall work/life balance was sufficient.  Hardest was lack of support and communication at times.
good,"You know when you are viewing 5 different reports in order to make another report things are getting out of hand. Not enough time to deal with customers and employees because of all the busy work, redundant reporting and endless conference calls and meetings. Focus on the important things and leave the busy work behind. Too many layers of management trying to justify their positions by creating more reports to do."
good,Fun workplace.  Room for advancement however in order to advance you need to back stab people.  Co-workers very hardworking.  Hardest part of the job is having to deal with politics.  Most enjoyable part of the job is working on different issues for customers.
good,"A typical work day consists of a jump start meeting in the mornings. followed by opening the location. We then begin to prepare for clients to walk in as well as making cold calls to perspective clients and current clients who are due for a financial review. "
good,"Terrible culture clash between PNC and one of the banks they absorbed. This resulted in constant in fighting, terribly outdated processes and general disarray."
good,Working at a bank was a different experience for me. I learned a lot and was excited to grow in the company. I had a great Supervisor who was so patient and willing to teach and a great co-worker who became a good friend of mine!
good,"there requirements are not realistic, i didn't mind talking to customers  however every called is critiqued and they always pic short calls to review which aren't fair enough bc your not always able to hit your points. They want you to talk to customers like you literately  know them and at the same time think about your time.And most customers like to tell you their life story lol. I believe they need to change some other requirements. Because too many people loose their jobs from this issue, or they are quitting bc of the stress of this issue."
good,"With PNC's ever-changing policy changes, it became nearly impossible to truly feel secure in the direction the company was headed or in any advancement opportunities. "
good,I really enjoy working for PNC. The core value of the company keeps me wanting to work there. The company really stripes to keep work and personal life balance.
good,Typical day at PNC would be servicing all issues that customer may have.  Giving this customer perfect assistance and completing their request earns me the right to see if there is any additional products that PNC would be able to provide for them to expand our relationship. This job has shown me alot about the world of finances and important values of small details make a differnce. Co-works are great team envoirment that allows everyone to help and share how to make the next one better. The hardest part about working in the banking field is the problem and issues you come across they may upset someone or prevent them from their funds. The best thing is getting someone the help they need and knowing that you've helped them in a way that can help them a long term
good,There is no sales training for a job that strongly focuses on sales.  Management was lazy and ill prepared to handle tasks.
good,"10 years in Operations and I have found that a typical Ops unit is not where I desire to spend the rest of my career."
good,"Not a fan of the hour lunches. Feel like it's a waste of time. Also, feeling like there is no balance between work and life is hard."
good,"I did learn a lot from PNC, but felt I wanted to grow and the company didnt want to have me grow the way I wanted too."
good,"There are great people there. The mortgage industry fluctuates, so there are intermittent layoffs here."
good,"Service high volume and activity driven commercial loan portfolios. I enjoy working in a team oriented department. The complexity and volumes have significantly enhanced my skills in multitasking,"
good,"My experience is that they can not seem to keep quality people because they do not compensate them enough. People are frequently moving around or leaving and they leave people thinned out without urgency to staff. "
good,took inbound calls to enroll customer in annually benefits for different companys.
good,"I have been in  Data Control Process up to the day I have to relocate in 2012 I have learn new work in Data Control as there have been several changes. I took every opportunity to learn what was giving to me. Maintained accounting systems utilized for foreign and domestic securities trading."
good,My first job so it was a good start but not what I wanted to do.  Needed to find a career.
good,"Maintain over one thousand Windows servers.  Responsible for working with business units to provide correct servers for the application."
good,I truly enjoy my co-workers and helping the clients with their banking needs.
good,Your just a number. Easy to not be noticed. Round hole in square peg.
good,Overall a decent place to work.   I am speaking from a corporate function side and do notice a difference between corporate and line of business specific cultures.  Good luck trying to advance in PNC  and if you do decide to take an opportunity to work here - make sure you negotiate all you can up front cause annual increases are in the 2-3% range and the bonus plan is horrible.  All the compensation stays at the top in this enterprise and there is no motivation to do anymore than the bare minimum required by your role.    There is an upside as if you are at the end of your career or need a 9-5 job that does not require much after-hours focus due to personal/family obligations.  That said - if you are mid career - this is not the place for you as you will be held back from a development perspective.
good,"Daily working with a team in a service and sales environment to deepen client relationships and share of wallet to increase revenue through cross-sale opportunities to meet clients needs/ goals/ desires."
good,promotes healthy and balanced working environment.  Provided fun activities with video game consoles for employees to relax during breaks.
good,Senior management needs to be more involved with the staff to understand the strengths and weaknesses of their employees.
good,"The position was very routine - try was no contact with borrower.  All documents were reviewed for accuracy and routed to underwritin for further review - to be approved or denied. "
good,Ok company. The people are ok. There are 6 tellers 2 are full time and 4 are part time. There is never enough help. The training was easy and the system is easy to use
good,If you are outside of Pittsburgh things are completing different. 
good,"Banking is a tough industry with the low interest rate environment. The people at PNC are great. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping clients discover needs and fulfilling them. The downside is that management is under intense pressure to keep cost down while the worker is under that same pressure to ensure customer quality interactions. Cutting cost usually means limiting worker client interactions, which is counter to what clients want. As workers we are stuck in the middle."
good,Good place to work if you are looking for a job and not a career
good,"boring atmosphere, not good coworkers, short breaks, overall not a future"
good,Processing checks for major accounts and processing paperwork for major companyhardest part is producing enough batches for sertine time frame
good,I love assisting customers with their day to day financial needs. Its even more fulfillig when I assist a customer with reaching their financial goals.
good,"I enjoyed my time there, but I wanted to focus solely on the investment side of the business and that opportunity was not there at PNC."
good,"Plenty of managers, very few leaders. Most development is now outsourced to less than qualified vendors. The ability to build and fix is hindered by processes that do not make sense."
good,"post payments to customer accounts. The jjob was not hard, there was no room for growth ."
good,"Excellent company values and overall vision provides direction for employees. very structured atmosphere, lack of communication from upper management. Branch employees are scored weekly based on customer service. they keep staffing to a minimum and avoid any overtime"
good,"It's great to work there if you don't have any aim in life or don't want to achieve anything career wise,, just fresh from college and leave of pay check after paycheck"
good,Remote availability for some positions allows for a concrete work/life balance. Managers can be easily reached for communication and there is a company culture of community.
good,"I have mixed reviews. I like working for the company and although they promote working to get you a better position, some management doesn't seem to try or care. Also, you don't get paid for the work you do beyond the basics. And sometimes not even that. There is no raises and during the ""year end reviews"", they are minimal, if at all."
good,Excellent colleagues.  Difficult to advance upward or to other departments. Sales and management functions take over the job without much support.  Tough work/life balance.
good,"Good job with great hours but very monotonous and once you learn something,  you are responsible for taking care of it. Time off is discouraged. Must be dependable and show up every day. Strict attendance policy."
good,Turnover is extremely high here.  PNC is a strong sales driven company.  Goals are pushed daily and plans are made to achieve those goals.  Bonus are strictly reflective of sales and performace.
good,"PNC is a highly respected, customer focused bank that provides a positive workplace culture which encourages employees to be the best in the industry."
good,"The overall environment was varied based on where you were working and what work you were completing. training was lacking in some areas and high management turnover. Enjoyed the work, overall."
good,it’s a good place to work with bankers hours so you have a set in and out time. customer satisfaction has really decreased due to a high turn over rate which puts pressure on workers to meet set sales goals
good,"Job was extremely stressful, training was ok. supervisor/team leader worked from home as well, had his office in his bedroom with a screen up behind him (partially), but it was very unprofessional! It was creepy!"
good,"Some positions promise work/life balance but do not follow through. Overtime has become mandatory in some departments because employees just leave due to management and/or department stress. Overall, the banking industry does not have competitive pay and you have a better chance on getting higher pay if you leave rather than being an internal transfer."
good,"Daily Sales class "
good,every coworkers would cook or bring a dish from home and be thankful for  having a excellent teams and for hitting our goals. We also help each other for solving a customer issues.
good,Great Bank and great organization if you're a banker.  Otherwise not a great place to work - lack of resources and leadership for peripheral businesses
good,More important to hurry your call vs good customer service and time to connect. Hard time understanding some customers due to accent. One person tells u a rule a d the next says it's wrong.
good,What I have learned about PNC is that the executives and upper management are highly guaranteed raises and advancement. While the lower management within the company gives praises for the employees work it is hard to move up if you are not a favorite. On the positive it is easy to build relationships with common coworkers. The most enjoyable part of the job were the coworkers.
good,"Decent benefits"
good,"Program was not very well organized and had a hard time retaining any talent whatsoever. Pay is below average, slow pace of work in office I was in. Hours are not bad at all."
good,"Don't see why after so many years working there, they hired a person (BOA) who was not fit for the job. The only thing she wanted to do was clean up house so that she can bring in others. Was not even out the door, when she already posted my position, weeks ago."
good,"I worked at two different PNC's within the 1 year that I worked there. I worked in Dayton Oho, on Main street and then in Pittsburgh my hometown. PNC was the first job I got out of college. It wasn't in my field but I felt it was a great job to start out with, and a way to learn and network. I learned ALOT working at PNC, I barely new how to read large numbers, right out checks, I didn't know what a cash advanced was or money market. So I'm very thankful for what I learned. But both managers I had made the job extremely stressful. My manger in Ohio was very demanding, intimidating, and rude. Several workers left the branch under her watch, My manager in Pittsburgh wasn't really a team player and she was never in the branch, it seemed like she would purposely make herself busy so she wouldn't have to be around us or customers, She was very back and fourth with rules. People kept leaving and transferring from that branch to . including our lead teller, so once she left me and one other girl had to basically be the lead teller and take on all the responsibilities without being paid extra or being trained really."
good,"Overall my job was great  , very friendly customers . Nice and steady days easy job. But the BM was very rude and did a lot of favoritism. Your good work doesn’t get recognized! Not flexible with requesting off. Get in trouble for calling out!"
good,OK place to work at. If a developer is used to taking additional pressure then this is the place to come and work. Apart from pressure rest everything is fine. People tend to extend their contracts on a very regular basis.
good,This job was not recent and couldn't rate it. A lot has changed both locations I worked at. Management has changed and so has the face of PNC. The way they do banking isn't the same as it was almost 5 years ago.
good,I was recently let go for something stupid. The management is awful and very unprofessional. You are not allowed to go to the bathroom and they watch your every move. You are just another body in a seat. The goals they have for calls are very hard to accomplish. A lot of calls I received were elderly customers and you practically had to push them off the phone while being nice. Not to mention being called names by angry customers on a constant basis. Management does not care if you have any sort of sickness. Training was a nightmare and we sat in a classroom for 3 weeks. One of the most important things you learn at the last minute. Also the material you learn in the classroom doesn't even get used while you're on the call or are told that it is incorrect. They do not reimburse you if you work from home. Management would also pick favorites as well.
good,If you're looking for higher pay within banking then I'd stray away from PNC. I know other people with the same job title as mine in other banks that make 10-20k more and that's when they first started.
good,"the day to day work is very easy and most days are slow, not the most exciting thing but its a good start and pays you money but so hard to move up in the company and teller is not a career."
good,"This job really all depends on your personal preference. You absolutely will just kind of blend in. You have coachings and things, but they're not as individual as they should be. You're so tied to schedule adherence that it's pretty much impossible to actually get to know any of your coworkers"
good,"PNC's foundation in PA and the northeast leaves much to be desired in terms of career advancement anywhere else. Management can be hit or miss, depending on the department you're in. Not a bad place to work, but don't expect great pay,"
good,PNCI was a good position to learn the ropes of PNC Bank and to get in the door to move around the bank. I enjoyed my time while I was there and moved on.
good,"If you work with great people in a branch, PNC bank can be quite the pleasant place.  You need to be a people person as you will interact with dozens of customers every day.  Management above a branch manager can be extremely incompetent (hence my departure)."
good,day to day is inbound calls.  Willing to get you your finra licenses but the day to day is monotonous and unfulfilling.  This is a position good for getting your licensees but is clearly not where you want to be for the rest of your days
good,"Typical day at work consists of you helping clients with their banking needs, wasn't so bad the hardest part of the job is dealing with managements and irate customers"
good,it is a great place to work. the hours are wonderful and the pay is good but the management they have running some of the branches are terrible. they expect the bankers to do their job but are not a good role model in that aspect.
good,"I held three difference positions at PNC.  Management, Wealth Management and Business Banking and loved BB the most.  It was challenged and had a super boss."
good,Growing pains and previous reputation for mortgage lending hinder personal growth. there is good potential for future earnings providing the mortgage loan officer can be self sufficient.
good,"Low pay for the level of responsibility.  You were second in charge after the branch manager, shouldn't the pay reflect that?  Branch Manager made the workplace very toxic."
good,I was told that I would be on the banker side of the Job 80% of the time and a teller 20% of the time. In 6 months I worked on the banking side only 5 days.
good,"PNC looks out for management and themselves, I made several reports of retaliation on my manager with evidence, and nothing was done. In my 5 years there I had two managers that were reported to HR by multiple members of the team multiple times and nothing was done. I've also had amazing managers who looked out for their teams. It all depends on where you are, But in general it seems to be a bit of a boys club."
good,Standard corporate structure in the banking industry. Compliance training and updates are frequent. There are numerous opportunities for growth and development.
good,"The call center, customer service industry is rapidly growing and pays well. The hours are very fixed, but there is always opportunity for OT hours. The hardest part of the job is not taking things personal, high stress, and fast paced. If you're a slow learner, this isn't for you. There isn't much room for upward mobility. The incentives that are given for meeting metrics, in my opinion make the work place culture disingenuous. Most likely, you'll be working from home. Most of the on-site call centers are closing."
good,"This is a good starting point but, I have so many years of escalated customer service experience! I'm talented and focused on getting the job done with or without help!"
good,"I worked at a small branch so is was vary slow all the time.  the training they give you is a joke, they dont teach you half the stuff you need to know."
good,"As a manager it is very stressful. They expect you to get things done in 40 hours but you are given things that would take you 70 hours a week to do. They add stress not only to your work life, but to home life too."
good,remain confident in a fast intense work environment. if there was any simple questions you would have to self problem solve. very diverse workplace. i enjoyed employee appreciation week.
good,The core values are not upheld by upper management at all.  Work life balance is not a priority and I spend most of my day fighting with other bank employees that are not a part of our department to get our daily work done.
good,PNC is a great company to work for. Being part of the PNC team means that you always give outstanding customer service by learning how to understand our clients financial needs.
good,Pnc is a good company but can wear on you some times.  It is stress filled and goal oriented.  Push push push for the sale even though the sales word is not to be mentioned.
good,"This job was a great teacher. You are paid well, but you are required to endure verbal abuse from the clients. There is lack of management assistance you are taught to own all mistakes. Basically you are the manage without the pay and perks."
good,"The folks have been good for the most part, but I'm just looking to change roles. PNC as a whole has treated me okay. The whole things is right down the center of the line. Nothing special."
good,"PNC Bank had a small credit card portfolio that they managed and tried to grow without success, so they sold it to MBNA in an attempt to make a profit."
good,It is a good place to work and the culture is also good. The new healthcare plan they put us in is my main complaint they are now under a high deductible plan.
good,"It would be a good thing once you have taken your break or lunches, just to get out of the day to day stress work sometimes brings and you can interact with your fellow emplyess"
good,"The Help Desk is so worried about customer service, that we cannot fix things.  Monthly reviews based on our customer service skills.  They don't care if anything gets fixed."
good,Hard to achieve goals when your branch is in a terrible location. I worked in an area that was considered a low to moderate income area and people were constantly rejected due to their credit. Also customers of the branch were on fixed incomes and weren't eligible for mortgages or any loans due to restrictions so it made it hard to achieve compensation.
good,PNC has a severe management issue.  It is clear that they do not really care about the associate experience.  Managers are very click-ish and lack experience.  The building itself needs an overhaul.
good,"You manage your time from your virtual office for this particular role."
good,Display features and benefits                            
good,Relaxed work enviornment. Quality and production driven. Requires alot of sitting and repetitive tasks. Clean facility and updated office equipment. I would recommend PNC.
good,good opportunity and training was adequate. communication of expectations and work related changes were timely. I think it was over-all a decent place to work.
good,"Experience started out great. Opportunities for bonuses, but they were very hard, and sometimes unattainable goals to reach."
good,"I only worked Part Time."
good,"Most locations are understaffed and floaters are not sent to necessary branches. Management rides you about sales goals all while reminding you ""not to push product""."
good,"A typical day at work was opening the branch and assisted customer by opening account, performing teller transactions and etc."
good,"I have worked with PNC for 7 years. I advanced within the company from an entry level position. However, for further advancement, it seems nonexistent. The pay is great to some, but if you live in a big city like myself and have rent, car payment, insurance and other bill necessities, you may have to stretch a penny. The benefits are good, but you get what you pay for. The more money you designate out of your paycheck, the better your benefits are. All in all, PNC is a great company to work for. My passion is just leading me elsewhere."
good,Working at PNC bank had it's challenges but for the most part was exciting with meeting new people everyday.Management was friendly and approachable. Workplace culture could use some work I never really got involved but at times favoritism could play it's part. The hardest part working on weekends but it was never a full day so one learned to adapt. I feel that the pay should have been more due to the nonstop atmosphere of work.
good,Very focused on sales. Lots of coference calls about what you are doing wrong not right. Lots of good people work there and help make the job a lot better.
good,This is a decent place to work.  There is a cafeteria on site. They have a lot of extra activities and giveaways.  it is a typical collections shop.  They try to create an open environment.
good,"Hiring freeze created more work for employees who remained."
good,"a typical day at work: organized, busy-sometimes running against the clock"
good,"•    Encouraged and engaged customers with financial opportunities, such as creating accounts,    "
good,They have heavy layoffs and dont tell you to allow you to prepare for the layoff. I wouldn't recommend this job if i was to be asked. The pay is OK for the industry
good,In the 90s the culture was awesome. In 2000 priorities changed to financial numbers focus and less on taking care of the customer  couldn't keep up with the industry during the financial crisis and was acquired by PNC. Didn't work after the conversion.
good,"I love working for PNC bank, if it wasn't for the managers themselves I would never want to leave. Although the hours are long (8am to 6pm) I still enjoyed myself while at work. The hardest part is working with the managers who do not care about anyone but themselves. I've made life long friends besides that, and it makes the work day go by quickly."
good,PNC is a 40 hour a week company with a goal of excellent customer service to their customers. you must have great credit and background to be able to work for this company.
good,"PNC requires you to go above and beyond, but the pay rate is below. The typical work day is very stressful and can sometimes interfere with your personal life, if you let it."
good,"The company has really good core values that are not always followed, even those in management. However really good stepping stone for a better gig. Compensation is decent, work days a little stressful however the company does try to make the atmosphere fun."
good,"This could be a great place to work, if management cared more about the salary of their employees. If they were more hands on and less fouced overall with none importgant factors."
good,"Overall, it was a fun place to work. The branch was in a good place, surrounded by restaurants. The customers were fun to talk to and the other employees made the day more fun. It was difficult to work on the referrals, which drove down our monthly bonus. Our branch never received a bonus, which was one of the issues I had with the company. The other issue I had, and was the main reason I left, was the pay."
good,"stress, stress, stress, worked on production, hard to kept up with quotes set each month, everyday what we were looking for was changed (sometimes from hour to hour)  you never knew what you were looking for, never had anything to say positive all negative, but ha good benefits"
good,"I worked at PNC Mortgage for almost four years.  It was a very professional environment and overall I enjoyed my time there.  The pay scale was low and while the benefits were reasonably good, I had had better.  There were layoffs and my job was among them."
good,"Ensure all daily banking transactions are completed. "
good,"Good company to work for to learn and grow but difficulties in compensation are not high and bonuses are challenging to achieve. Great bank to develop corporate bank skills, Respectable in the eyes of the financial industry"
good,"Typical day to day includes assisting customer with a variety of banking needs and issues. Management (based off of location) is helpful to a point, but often is unavailable for assistance. Every day is different which is exciting but can also cause unneeded stress like most customer service related positions can be."
good,"Good company to get your career started! I started as a teller and noticed many opportunities to advance your career! however, the compensation  is below industry standard."
good,"This company has so much potential and where 1 manager wants to care for all, 5 want to create and foster an environment of immaturity. "
good,Overall this was a good place to work but due to moving I needed to find something closer to home.  My manager was fantastic but the cons is that the departments didn't work well as a team combined.
good,"not very flexible in work hours, high expectations for employees to open accounts and recruit new clients in a very low income/dead area, low pay with high expectations"
good,Really good company to be employed with. They are very conservative in some areas of the company. As a Bank they do not take a lot of risk when it comes to advancing and staying up to date with technology.
good,Conflicted relationship building strategy vs production goals. Production goals are always at the forefront of everything although your told that deepening client relationships is the goal.
good,"Typical banking operations, with a well diversified management group.  Unfortunately, cold calling is now prevalent in daily practices."
good,the management structure since the low rate environment continues is crazy. its purely a sales organization with little focus on customer needs. credit card and merchant for PNC's sake
good,"I was a Vice President and the Senior Portfolio Manager in PNC Advisors. Princeton was their largest office with over 600 accounts.The job was easy, except for the number of clients that I was expected to serve. They ranged from 600 when I started to 350, when they hired a second portfolio manager.There was a great deal of client entertainment at breakfast, lunch and dinner.and many company meetings at a distance. I worked hard and was well paid. "
good,"Work Life Balance was very good, Mngmnt OK - really push on widget selling - and obtaining goals.  Restructure of the Business Bnking Line of Business - many good employees have been Displaced.  High Deductible Health Insurance is just awful."
good,"Many promises when hiring but not real opportunities once on board, very limited branches on this market and even more limited advance opportunities, limited duties compare to similar positions at other banks based on 15 yrs experiences"
good,"Seems great at the onset, once you get your feet wet and settled in, you begin to see why turnover is so frequent.  Performance driven with limited ability to own the experience.  100 calls per day, seems like Team Leads are never around, or when they are they are in meetings or busy."
good,The management seems to be very negative.Training platform was very poorly setup. Without support from our managers it was hard to succeed.
good,"I was a Teller with PNC for roughly 1 year. A typical day consisted of taking care of customers deposits, answering questions, providing assistance with any issues within my capacity to solve all while following corporate policies and procedures."
good,"PNC is a very good place to work. One of the best companies to work for, They have many opportunities for there employees."
good,"I have been employed with PNC for the past 15 years and throughout my years I had multiple positions within PNC.  I began my career with National City Bank back in 2001 until the merger with PNC Bank NA.  I enjoy working at PNC however, I feel its time for a change."
good,"A typical work day consist of taking anywhere between 60-110 calls per day regarding account products and services. It can be  a very stressful environment to work in if you are not use to a high call volume call center. Ive learned there is so much more to banks than checking and savings accounts. Learning how a bank account, loan, mortgage and credit cards actually work is knowledge that you can take with you for the rest of your life."
good,"PNC is a decent company to work for, but they do not pay very well for the amount of work employees are expected to do. It is also difficult to move up depending on which department you are in."
good,Bank has turned into sales to much. Customers do not like it. I like to make customers happy and want to come back. Not unhappy that they are being harassed for new products every time they come into the bank.
good,"Management id ok. The work environment is very quiet but weird. There is not much, if any communication between coworkers. Not really a team environment."
good,"I worked for PNC Bank for three years. Their call center is a great place to work, however, their branches are full of shady politics and unethical practices. I was let go when they found another person that could do my job at 5 branches for $10,000 less per year than what I was making. They let go 9 total people in the area when they closed the branch, and fired all of them before the day before the branch closed so that they could avoid having to pay severance. When we all went to file for unemployment, PNC told unemployment that we were all let go due to insubordination - which unemployment quickly caught on to and made PNC Pay us unemployment. I heard that a few lawsuits were filed, but I did not get involved."
good,"Benefits are ok- only high deductible health plans available"
good,Most management are great and really incurage your development. They push you to achieve the best and make the most out of yourself. The best is being able to work with colleagues and learn from them hands on.
good,The compensation is far below the norm for the same positions at competing companies. The employee turnover is very fast and it's quite impersonal. Even the interview was conducted as a group interview.
good,There have been many drastic changes in banking today with technology so today it is more outreach to have the customers come into the bank for appointments.
good,good place to work and friendly environment. there were lots of changes that took place while I was there. I worked on multiple projects while employed there.
good,Customer based company with sales as your goal.  Immediate manager was great to work with.  I love helping people meet their financial goals but making sales goals was very difficult for me.
good,There are many things that need improvement in their investment process and management style.  Overall its a great entry level position but as of right now has not been developed into a true career path where an individual can build a book of business.
good,"I love banking, its second nature to me. With the experience I have in banking, I see myself in corporate and mentoring others in the workplace. I love helping others. I also love banking as a whole. I truly know I can reach the top of the corporate world and making good money by the experience and knowledge that I have learned over the years."
good,Very demanding and heavy call volume always.  Very strict guidelines to meet.  The company asks for our opinions of how to approve but then lacks the follow through.
good,"limited growth and pay, advancement is limited andvery slow during the selection.  Too big for its own good people are retiring and leaving in large numbers who have been there for years"
good,"Mostly about numbers, not so much of the persona treatment at work. Management is good to work with. Benefits are worse than before; cut in insurance plans. Not many if at all opportunities to advance"
good,"A good place to work, but much turnover in the WM department. There also was much confusion since the National City merge had just occurred. I believe it was a bad timing when I started there and a reason for this lack luster review."
good,"There were busy times, and down times, but always something to do. I learned a lot about laws, and regulations. The branch based management I had were all very good. I am still close with my coworkers I started my career with. I enjoyed helping my customers the most."
good,they expect you to make phone calls even with clients coming in to open accounts. They prefer appointment only and expect 15-20 calls everyday
good,"Responsible for providing exceptional customer sales and service while exemplifying PNC's brand of Ease, Confidence, and Achievement."
good,"A typical day would consist of managing the Branch Vault, handling business deposits, focusing on branch audits, training tellers on sales."
good,"Responsible for on boarding, applications throughout the banking network. "
good,Hard to advance in this area. Regional manager has unrealistic expectations and does not look out for her employees. Most of the staff in my area is new because she has ran them off. The employees at the branches are typically great but regional manager is not.
good,Not as customer service motivated as they were years ago.  More focused on individual outcomes than working as a team.  The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the customer.  The hardest part was sitting in meetings that were unproductive.  I still see most of my co-workers and have built long term relationships.
good,"My typical day starts at 7am in the office, where i have to review complex data , analyze them and translate them into simple and transparent reports for management"
good,"Each day is filled with different good and bad things happening."
good,"Being a teller is not mentally challenging, but corporate requirements and training will make you feel like you're an idiot who needs to be told common sense things at least three times a day. "
good,Can not provide adaquate review as I'm only a temporary employee.
good,Lucky enough to work with some great people but the overall structure of the mortgage business needs work
good,I felt the this was an overall good place to work but management was constantly changing and that would cause for you to get skipped over for forward advancement.
good,"My typical day at work was greeting, helping and conducting transactions, helping co-workers with odd transactions and coaching them in their personal goals.  As a supervisor I also kept my manager abreast of any situation that arose.  I would say that the hardest part of the job especially in a large branch is catching a co-worker up on details that they missed when they were off.  The most enjoyable part of the job was watching your co-workers expand and grow and customers Thanking You."
good,"Hard to advance, no structure, have to get in the door then bounce from job to job to get a head monetarily."
good,"A typical day for me was busy and constantly learning. Learning a lot about how funds circulate in the Government. Management was very challenging. Co-workers greet team players, The hardest part of the job was not be able to satisfy customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was being recognize for great job performances."
good,Normally your days are predictable. Sometimes management pushes for optional surveys to be mandatory.
good,Typical day as a teller waiting on customers by taking care of their financial transaction and providing excellent customer service.
good,"Bank is trying to move into the Big Bank arena and does not have the infrastructure, nor the system to do so correctly. Training was very good and in my roll there is not a ton of micromanagement on a daily basis."
good,This is a great job if you're looking for a part time job or retired. It's not a great job for a single mom or even parents looking to make a decent amount of money.
good,typical day includes servicing all customer accounts while trying to sell a PNC product.
good,"• Typical banking hours, 8-4:30pm."
good,There is no average day here - your day will be determined by the customers who walk in the door.  Fast-paced environment with high goals.
good,"sometimes opening procedures then following up on customer requests for service and assistance. day-to-day responsibilities consist of answering branch phones, assisting customers with opening accounts and account servicing, applying for loans, credit cards, and consult bank customers, and suggest products to help benefit them. management is under pressure to perform, and threatened for lack of better words. co-workers are very diverse from all walks of life and range in age. "
good,Co-Workers were great but they definitely need more training on many aspects of the on-boarding experience for every new hire.
good,Worked in the Detroit Region. Regional micro managed. My Manager was horrible. Assistant Manager was Great. Customers came in with bad attitudes. Co-workers showed no team work and didnt want to be there. Would prob still be there if I had better co-workers.
good,"Collector of mortgage payments, review and document customers financial information to determine if they pre qualify for a loan modification"
good,"There is no typical work day on the Trust team. Every day is a little different. We do handle overdrafts and discretionary request on daily basis. I work with a team of professionals daily; Private bankers, Investment advisers, Financial advisers, and Wealth planners. A typical day could be opening and closing accounts, handling IRA's and RMD's, researching governing documents, preparing data for various types of litigation, account reviews, client meetings, fee projects, administrative reviews, communication with clients, educating branch employees about our Wealth Management offering, detecting new business opportunities within our existing book and cultivating new relationships with clients and COI's. "
good,"Normal bank job, All you have to know is basic Policy and Procedures.  Upper Management has unrealistic goals.  All but one of my co-workers are great the one I do work with doesn't want me there and proves it to me every day I go to work. The hardest part of my job is seeing him everyday.  The most enjoyable is when he is no there."
good,This is a good place to start out. Not a great place for a career.
good,Interact with customers processing transactions and identifying additional needs to refer to other lines of business.
good,could be better in terms of compensation and advancement opportunities
good,"Ok job. comfortable office, nice hours. I'm meant to be outdoors however and it just wasn't my thing."
good,"so far I can see pay is low, it is decent hours.  it seems like the management do care about you, but the opportunity for advancement is limited"
good,"I key checks and documents.  I have learned how to look at the whole picture of the department and how each job effects each other."
good,"started with First of America-great bank to work for. merged with National City-also great bank to work for. Both encouraged career advancement, incentives and company activities outside of the workplace.  Merged with PNC Bank resulted in forced retirements, downsizing in all departments and over-all micro management"
good,.Great job as long as you're efficient in counting money. It's pretty laid back and you get a lot of interactions with different people. Room for advancement. 
good,"Go to work at 3:00 pm, until all checks were completed. Encoded and proofed all checks done for that day. The most enjoyable part was getting to see how many checks you could do in an hour. The hardest part was working until all checks were done, no matter how long it took."
good,"Company is a decent company with pretty good products. Base pay is $12/hr with a 10% shift diff if you work after 11am. Management has a high turn over rate because the job is so boring and stressful. Take customer call after call, always busy, and there's never any supervisors around to assist with the crazy customers. Not a horrible entry level job but you will burn out within 6 months. i don't know how I did 2 years :-/"
good,Working with Sr. level management brings about its challenges because everyone has their own idea of how things should be. That shows the diverse nature of mindsets that's placed PNC amongst the leading institutions in the country . My team is a dynamic group of individuals that care about bring forth quality products which makes working with them an absolute joy.
good,I learned to get everything in writing. When their is disfunction and lack of team work understand it truly rolls down. All the way down to the janitoral staff.
good,Typical day I work from home. I may instant message some of my friends good morning and begin chatting with customers.
good,"Mid-America Bank bought St. Francis Bank, National City Bank Purchased Mid-America Bank then PNC Bank acquired National City Bank."
good,"A typical day at work was doing standard transactions such as cashing checks, withdrawals, deposits, payments and checking balancing. We also would transfer funds. I personally handled a lot of our hardware malfunctions and called in problems or fixed them when I could. Co-workers got along just fine. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers yelling at us. The most enjoyable is when we got to be friends with some of our customers."
good,"• Coordinate with branch staff by providing support in opening accounts, processing loan applications, and cross selling products"
good,Learned a lot and I was lucky to have a good manager. Mortgage is still growing mud level management is poor. Pay is mediocre
good,A typical day is all the same. You come in do your work and go home. They dont like you to talk so its kept to a minimum. They really don;t care about your personal issues.
good,"I have learned to dig deeper and push harder, attention to detail and customer focus in the role of a negotiator."
good,Again a friendly place. Management willing to help and provide extra training. Much pressure to sell on all employees. Much focus on the bottom line. For someone who likes competitive sales it is a good place to work.
good,PNC offers great benefits and work at home flexibility.  Health insurance is not great. Work is repetitive but easy to learn. Throughout the year you can be super busy or you may not have enough work to do. Most of the time your doing the tasks of 2 or more people and from other departments. A lot of politics and favoritism goes on. It is really who you know to advance in your career. Pay is not adequate for the industry and for the work.  Great place to gain experience and learn about banking.
good,"The people at PNC are their best asset, but their technology leaves much to be desired.  The best part of the job is being able to work from home, but even though they tout being 'inclusive', leadership makes decision without input from staff. Poor overall communication."
good,"I did customer service same as any other call center in Columbus Ohio. it is kind of like a high school environment, a lot of gossip and child play. but as long as you go to work and do your job you should be fine"
good,The job was good. I started as a part-time teller and within six (6) months I was being offered the Teller Supervisor position. The problem was the pay was very low. The managers and co-workers were all nice and helpful. My only issue was the very low pay.
good,Like any job there are pros and cons. Be prepared to be in a high paced sales environment. You be required to make suggestions to customers and businesses about products and services.
good,Management is one of the reasons I am not returning to PNC  love the bank but not those in charge they have their favorites and hard to move up within the company
good,"This job has everything to do with who you work with. If the people don’t like you don’t make a mistake, you’ll be terminated. Managers were great but if someone goes above their heads its out of their control. Be careful with movement, the branch i went to ended up being the end of my career. This isn’t a great company for job security."
good,"Due to the quality of work and the environment at PNC, there has been a substantial amount of turnover since I started. Moreover, there does not appear to be any change coming to improve employee morale."
good,"The company is ok to work for, there are multiple opportunities to move up if you are in the right department. Unfortunately the department I was in this is not possible."
good,at this company this has to be something that you really want to do. the work is different its the same thing ever day depending on your position. i will say if you are a people person and willing to stick it out you will like it and will stick around for a chance to grow in the company.
good,Pnc is an institution where  they do very well to develop an individual into their role. They offer lots of training and mentor-ship that will provide you with the skill needed to advance.
good,Pnc was a good place to work. I loved my staff and got alone with mostly everyone. You will be over worked once they see what you actually are willing to do so I suggest you just do your job and nothing more. It was stressful at times and I felt like I couldn’t get a moment to myself from emails to all employees asking me questions as soon as I walk in. My position was teller lead and I was really good at my job. They had okay benefits and lunch’s were okay. They are sales driven just like any other bank and they take the surveys that customers write very seriously. They scale of the surveys are horrible. If you get one bad one then your a red employee an you will be put on a warning.
good,I was in between jobs when I accepted that job I had been layed off from Ohio saving after 12 years and I needed a job so that where Pnc came in at. I stay there maybe I year
good,"very easy going,easy jobs, very nice and fun people to work with. great management and great lead personal . air conditioned for summer and heated for winter"
good,"This particular job blends remote and traditional job functions to optimize work life balance as long as goals are met. Lots of autonomy with getting job done! Products and services of bank are very strong too as PNC leads in several spaces. The people are nice to work with within the retail and commercial branch network but the company is disjointed from its legacy culture in Pittsburgh."
good,learned basic skills needed for my next career step- got bank holidays off which was nice. helpful transitioning into the office setting. It was a good place to start out.
good,Under-paid over worked no life work balance. Really good benefits but no formal straight process and support for direct response. daily unexplained changes
good,It was ok working here. I enjoyed it for a while then the atmosphere changed. There is a high turn over and managers changed often which may be the reason.
good,Usually the day will begin with a daily standup meeting to set goals for the day and review what has been done. Then the day will begin in earnest with a mix of development work and possibly more meetings to discuss requirements and work through outside obstacles. The hardest part of the job is that there are multiple layers of permissions to acquire so the start of the job is very slow.
good,"I worked as both an associate and a manager.  "
good,"Hard to make determination on PNC as a whole, however at the corporate center I was at there seems to be little to no structure and very limited advancement.  Good place to get your foot in the door in the financial field, but cannot see a career."
good,it was so long ago i dont really remember much positive about it. the only negative i remember is the growth from within was close to impossible. and they laid off a lot
good,"My first 5 -7 years excellent after that the department changed contracts and it was down hill from there"
good,"Perfect for those who could thrive on stress. Though my position was not a stressful one, too many employees from managers to tellers  felt they could be terminated due to excessive unrealistic goals required to be met."
good,"When I was employed at PNC I was not happy with the amount of pushiness that upper management was giving. They wanted me to offer every person a credit card, even if they had previously declined within a week."
good,"PNC Bank has a great workplace culture and the management is at best, standard. Has great cross training opportunities for Universal Banking positions but does lack on keeping current employees interested and engage because of turnover."
good,"call center for a bank - stressful "
good,"PNC Bank provides opportunities to grow in your career and benefits to support the initiative.  Unfortunately those benefits and opportunities are generally located in the larger areas with a higher concentration of employees, such as Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.  Cincinnati does not have a high enough concentration of employees to have access to benefits such as, sick child care, on-site lunch facilities, etc."
good,I have been with PNC Bank since it was formerly National City Bank and I was displaced in 2014 and now I have the fun of it happening again. I need to work.
good,"My daily duties consisted of: answering phones, client servicing, cold calling clients, teller, payment processing, sales positioning, referrals, data entry, confidential filing, notary, "
good,"I have had experience being the interim manager for my branch, so I am familiar with handling the logistics side of operating a branch, in terms of: ordering funds for the cash processes from our vendor, ordering supplies for the branch, as well as making sure our files and procedures were being followed and adhered to at all times."
good,Great place to learn multiple roles if there is opportunity and openings.  Good benefits and decent compensation.  Great fast paced atmosphere which made days go quickly.
good,I assisted customers with there daily transaction.  I also would make suggestion on their financial needs as well as lobby engage. To make sure customer were assisted fast
good,Every job has its ups and downs so depending on which supervisor you get will determine your longevity for that position after you pass the initial initial training and probation you have your health benefits which are really great
good,It is a nice experience and I am glad to work there but I feel like I need a change in pace. A typical day is trying to get your number of files done to make sure your not behind.
good,"I have been loyal to PNC since March 2005. PNC has been a good place to work, however they make it very hard to cross over into some of the desired departments such as Human Resources."
good,PNC is a grind. Up to 300 calls a day with only a minimal break. The management there is a joke and they will be quick to replace you............................
good,Its a great company to work for and a knowledgable place to learn from. PNC company give free training lessons to its employees to teach them how to provide a well being financial services.
good,"Very relax business  environment , dress code. very supportive mangers and team. upper managements surprise visits to motivate employees . Great benefits."
good,Is a solid employer. Various locations available across United States. Continual learning environment. Pursues continual process improvement techniques. Great benefits.
good,"Start the morning off by checking voicemails and emails and then pull reports to balance the day and tackle the most important jobs for the day, return all calls and verify loan information to customers."
good,"Operations Officer on the Enterprise Crisis Management Team. "
good,it pays the bills but it gets mundane and management( depending on who you get) can be lousy. your taking class from people who know they don't have n=money or know they did wrong all day. People are screaming and cursing a lot.
good,Good work culture and the people are nice. A lot of politics to get to where you want to be due to the size of the company. Pay could be better. Seems to value outside prospects more than internal employees
good,"I currently work for the Equipment Finance sector of the company.  We were acquired by PNC, April 2017. My negative experience is purely with the original ECN Capital management team.  PNC Bank has been a pleasure to work with and they truly appreciate their employees.  I count it a blessing to be employed with PNC Bank."
good,"It was OK. Not bad not great. Could be better. Pay is OK. Compensation was OK, but made it harder and harder. Work life balance was good though. That has been figured out."
good,"Flexible job hours, able to work from home."
good,"I know longer work for PNC. The last PNC bank that I worked in was Peters Township in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I enjoyed my position and had no intention on leaving PNC."
good,"take inbound calls, case management, customer focus, problem resolution, case management, hardest part of the job is keeping up with cases that are assigned."
good,The hardest part of my job is not having the accurate training to do my job. No training class only to rely on your peers who have 80 + in their pipeline.
good,"Bosses are very nice, you have to be a peoples person to work at PNC bank. Banking has to be easy to understand for you to make sales. Very important to know your products."
good,The department you work in determines the culture of the work group. Bathroom breaks are scheduled and time limited..You can move to other work groups
good,every job has changes however most of the changes should include everyday workers ; should be better training better updates and not last minute updates.
good,My apologies but I do not feel comfortable sharing this information in this forum.  Like any company it has its pros and cons but I do not wish to share that info in this space.
good,typical work day is to process mortgage payment sort mail i learn how to process mortgage payment the management was there but not very helpful work culture was not very friendly
good,"However in my experience, PNC was not there when my manager abuse me in many ways, Even though i reported it they didn't do anything. Management needs to me reviewed."
good,"it was ok for the most part , stressful and fast paced just about everyday , so you would have to enjoy that type of work . workplace culture was cool"
good,"PNC has a strong culture of inclusion and collaboration. However, the lack of process and reliance on relationships as a means of getting business done is ineffective post merger with National City. Leadership direction is unclear and often plagued with lack of prioritization. Collaborative bend has created a culture of decision (or more accurately indecision) by committee. Roles and responsibilities are not always clear, decision makers hard to identify. The organization is not nimble or fast-paced, slowed somewhat by regulatory requirements but otherwise by self-imposed bureaucracy. People are nice, willing to help - but slow to provide constructive feedback. It rates high for me personally due to work-life balance with flexibility options to meet both professional and personal needs."
good,"Expectations and requirements frequently changing. Staffing not conducive to a successful work environment. Do your job and do it well, tomorrow new things will be added. Frustrating environment where the customer is always right even when they scream at you and treat you poorly."
good,"I’ve worked in several different areas and all have many inconsistent & cumbersome manual processes.  And project-related decisions take too long due to the need for multiple levels of management input and approval & key stakeholders don’t attend status meetings or read minutes, so r unfamiliar with all the issues & either take weeks to give a final decision or make a rushed decision not taking the necessary time to understand the complexity or consequences of their decisions. PMs r too inexperienced to demand stakeholder attendance. If you speak truth to power (e.g there’s no way this work can be done properly in the time given) u will be shunned, criticized by your manager for being negative & not being a “team player” & will be written up on your annual review. Systemic dysfunction at its worst!  Managers love to play Monday night quarterback when something goes wrong never recognizing (or admitting) that they made the final go ahead decision. No support for fresh new ideas or alternative solutions, which is so  typical of a large bureaucratic bank. After u start working there, even when u make or exceed expectations, annual increases don’t keep up with cost of living.  With the keyword being EXPECTATIONS; even when u improve year to year, they will slightly tweek their expectations so as to not give too many “exceeds” or “greatly exceeds” ratings as mgr. r limited to only a small % of employees that can be rated “exceeds” or “greatly exceeds”, so only their buddies & sycophants get that rating. It’s a shame as NCB was such a better and more efficient place to work."
good,"Unfortunately, PNC is known for not compensating well and this has been the case with me. The firm has not been generous with either salary increases or bonuses for the past few years."
good,I just feel there is no room to grow or improve even if you can move up in the company they keep your pay at a lateral move. What is the point in taking a position 2 paygrades higher if your pay remains the same.
good,"Company is focused on customers. "
good,PNC was a great workplace wigth friendly people at the forefront of the company. PNC back office functions were a little iffy at times but at the end of the day got the job done. in my role with PNC it is very sales driven and not customer focused
good,"Friendly atmosphere, teaching and learning was acquired. The company cared about employees and treated them well.  Not much for advancement but paid more."
good,"My time with pnc was okay. The environment was very stressful and the employees were not happy in their positions which affected the moral."
good,"PNC offers a good work/life balance. The folks working at PNC are good people and try hard. Overall, not a bad place to work - pay is not overly competitve with rest of industry."
good,"A very nice group of professionals."
good,"PNC is a nice place to work, it is a large company however, if you are placed in a slower branch it may be difficult for you to advance in your career"
good,"PNC really lives the work/life balance culture.  They do provide an environment where you are in charge of you own destiny, however that may be due to the large workload/span of control being put on the management team so that they cannot allocate any time to this activity.  Compensation process is flawed."
good,Company was good. Vacation time was good. Very comparable to other banks in the area. They seem to be a few steps behind when it comes to its competitors and the processes that they use.
good,"Depending on your department, your experience may vary."
good,I worked for PNC for about two years. They have many departments. Its a fast pace working environment. I loved my team we all pushed each other and we were always encouraging to one another.
good,Professional culture with emphasis on work-life balance. Emphasis on career development and allowed for classroom training when applicable to job functions.
good,The company had a major growth pattern during my time working there. My manager was wonderful and consistent during both daily work and company change.
good,"A typical work day, would be chatting with two customers at a time. Helping them with any and all questions about their checking, savings, credit card and loan accounts."
good," Reviewed credit applications and assessed risk of individual and commercial clients.  Upheld regulatory guidelines "
good,"PNC is an interesting place work at. As the company keep adding acquisitions, the challenges to get the data organized and integrated was getting bigger and bigger. For anyone who works there has to be prepared to deal with a diverse data environment."
good,"I only worked for PNC for a very short time quite a while ago, so I do not feel comfortable providing a review of them as an employer.  It was a good place for me to start my career and start to learn what I did and did not want in a job."
good,PNC is a company with a lot of room for advancement. Good benefits and pay. Paid holidays and vacations. Fun work environment. Helpful support from co workers.
good,"come in early to do night drop and balance ATM(s)  clean area by doors opening at 9 am   Assist clients in various needs.  Exchanging with others to cover Lobby for Lobby Engagement practices (if you had proper employees to allow this)   Take a lunch making sure line and desks are covered.  After lunch repeat the morning activities along with anything you may have to follow up on after having your conversations with clients and determining needs.  then balance drawer, and card machine and unjam the ATM  make sure all security measures are maintained at ALL times."
good,I love the flexibility and ability to work remotely. Not many opportunities for advancement in the Tampa area. Low pay. Bonus structure changing. Need to provide better pay and opportunities to advance.
good,"I enjoyed working with the staff, the sales requirements and constant sales reminders made the job stressful. Also, there is a lot of on the job training. That is very good"
good,"just a number in the company. does not matter how well you do, you wont move up if you dont know the right people. a lot of  unethical issues within the company in retail branches."
good,"Company with great benefits. "
good,"Assisting all customer needs, cash and deposit checks, open and close accounts, settle and replenish ATM, order and ship money, settle teller and branch settlements"
good,"Hard to move up because of all the outside hires. Although trained and has the abilities to do what they ask, opportunities are limited due to whatever reason. Seems to be a bit of favoritism."
good,"PNC is a great job, but it can be extremely stressful.  The company is very big on micromanaging, and for some job security is not certain. There are great networking opportunities."
good,"Massive work area - Alot of space "
good,"There are some great aspects to working for this company -- some locations offer casual attire and some business units are permitted to WFH, with reasonable limitations when you do WFH.  You get to work with a wide array of people across locations - which is both challenging and interesting.  There is talk about ""challenging the status quo"" but should you levy a challenge it is often not well received.  There is frequent change of leadership with in the teams - which is disruptive and prevents continuity. They do have a liberal internal job posting practice, but moving with in can be challenging.  Despite qualifications for open positions. hiring is based more on who you know than what you know - which is extremely discouraging.  I feel there is not a gender pay gap at this company.  The pay grades and comp structure is based on the job - not who fulfills it.  Which is a plus!   The typical work day is filled with conference calls.  Some of which are helpful, others that are not a good use of ones time.  Health benefits are not great.  Plans have a high deductible and out of pocket expenses.  They are generous with vacation time, etc.  After you meet a required time of service you can even purchase another weeks vacation.  Most managers are accommodation with Dr's appts etc.  For those considering working here, i would ask questions during the interview process and make sure you are comfortable before you accept any offers.  If you want to achieve a certain level, career wise, ask what you need to do etc.  Career path'ing is NOT a strong point at this company.  They consider"
good,"Customer service focus, typical day on auto dialer taking outbound and incoming calls fast pace enviorment. Good culture base, enjoyable part of the job was to satisfy the customer, to reach your goals in regards to montior requirments within the calls. What I learned was how to handle irate callers as well as being a teamplayer, how to stay customer focus and friendly at the same time."
good,The job was through an agency and i was not picked up by the company.  I enjoyed working for the company but the training process was not there. Thank you
good,too big.  good room for advancement if you know people.  They paid for my education but wouldn't give me a job in the field they sent me to school for.
good,"PNC is like any other bank. The benefits are fine. The pay is average (below average for my experience). Career advancement is difficult for somebody my age. The recruiting process is very slow and the managers don't seem to know what they are looking for. (If they have 10 things on their list and you have 9 you are not qualified.) Not sure it was a good idea to move back and work here. Very disappointed with how things are currently going. My situation may be unique. If you are young and want a decent place to work, then PNC is probably for you."
good,"PNC was a great bank I was with them for over 3 years and I love it . However , I found better income opportunities and wanted to be around a more uplifting crowd ."
good,Learned a lot from PNC Bank during my tenure.  I was able to advance within the first seven years there.  PNC Bank seem to struggle the past few years on the direction they want the branches to go and on what has been happening in market as far as compliance.
good,"Working for PNC was a grind.  They took the role of being a Business Banker and added the role of an experienced FA.  It is a sneaky way to see and review high valued clients assets in DDA's and attempt to convert.  Sounds like a good way to go but in reality, not in my opinion."
good,Schedules are completed weekly...daily work schedules once clocked in is structured per the needs of walk in customers as well as appointments set by staff
good,I Don’t have an opinion of company. I do believe that they could improve on the salary as to the amount of work expected of us daily. I don’t have any other complaints
good,The culture took a dramatic shift to a sales first organization with little concern for employees or customers. I understand sales are what keep the doors open but should not come a the expense of the employees or clients
good,"Peers are friendly, management is open to conversations with employees. I started at PNC and the training program is ineffective. Four different facilitators in four weeks, no consistency in work materials and ""the new training system is coming"" which doesn't benefit those in a broken training environment. "
good,a typical day requires you to do a specific job function while helping others complete theres.  must be done in a timely manor. management doesn't give new hires the time they need for training and just hope that you will catch on quickly. everything changes almost everyday referring to policy's and procedures. most of the people are nice and occasionally they feed you lunch the pay is ok and there is room for growth only if someone retires or leave.
good,Sell sell sell. High expectations of selling accounts per month. Long hours. They do good trainings for the position. Pay is good with incentives. Off holidays
good,I was required to produce extensive reports as well as assist annually with United Way.  Overall this was a fair place of employment but required a lot of duties that required me to engage in banking of which I had no interest in.
good,"It was a good company to work for, it was very difficult to get loans to close in a timely manner.  I was able to support branches to help customers with their mortgage needs and interact with the branch employees."
good,No support from regional management. Relax company to work for. When you have management they can be supportive. Sales goes are relaxed compared to competitive companies.
good,"I worked for this employer in a number of function, some of them were good, some overly managed. I left the job to pursue other opportunities.........."
good,A lot of room for development but its hard to advance. Management staff is great but there is not a lot of work life balance with the company. They have a lot of options but it is hard to get time off.
good,Had to suffer a period of management right sizing the company at branch level.  It didn't take long to figure out that two financial advisors was one too many per branch.
good,"I enjoyed the company alone with staff, mangers and location. They help me acquire an Insurance license to help customer with Annuities and further investments. Rewards were giving for annual sales pushing new products to clients."
good,"don't have one am being forced to do this before proceeding to job application"
good,Current management very good.  Past management-very much micro managed.  Culture is very competitive-pitting co-workers against each other.  Even though we as workers try to work as a team - in order to reach goals there are many times you must work as cut throat.  This makes for very stressful environment.  Once you've worked here for a length of time and reach the middle of the pay band scale it is very difficult to receive decent raises- 2% is considered a good raise.  The longer I work here the further I fall behind in just covering the cost of living.
good,it was an alright place to work. It is very fast pace in some departments in other departments it slow. I was in college at the time so it was the best paying job around
good,PNC was a great starting place for me in the financial institution industry.  I left my job with PNC for an advancement opportunity within the bank with PFPC Trust Company.
good,"good bank, very good training and management ,  workplace culture good, good learning experiences, very busy branches, bank believes"
good,I works about 46 hours a week as a part time employee and then I was promoted to a full time employee after work several months do several others job.  I was a back up teller supervisors.  I did that job on a daily basis before being let go.  I feel I was let go because I said something to management about doing some else's job and not be paid for the position
good,Working at PNC probably wouldn't have been as terrible of an experience if there was better management. My manager claims to care about the feelings and well-being of the other employees but is constantly proving otherwise by her actions.
good,The work environment was ok and manageable. I along with fellow coworkers were having problems with how we were managed. Other than that the workplace was enjoyable. the hardest part of the job I would say is setting up mortages and car loans.
good,Great Job wasn't there long enough to really enjoy it. they really invest into their employees and want them to succeed. Fast paced and really want you to well in sales
good,"Not a lot to comment on.  The atmosphere was tense.  Managers were not always well educated in the areas they managed.  If assistance was required, it was difficult to get assistance."
good,They seem to lose sight of their employees and are too focused on just making revenue. Frequent late hours with little notification. Seems to be alot of bullying and favoritism within the company which doesn't allow for qualified employees to advance their careers.
good,Nothing new.  Its a bank job and can be a good place to hone your customer service skills.  No flexibility on hours and you don't get the best pay. Still ok place to work.
good,Its a good place to work at if your good at making sales. I'm not a sale person so this is not the best fit for me. Customer service I'm good with its just a matter of being nice to ppl. Westfield is the worst place to be a teller just fyi.
good,Closed loans for Home Equity products. Worked with loan officers and underwriters throughout the process. Very fast paced position and very challenging
good,"Headquartered out of Warrenville, IL it was beautiful to have the entire team with main office based out of Pittsburgh, PA. There was no room within Illinois to move up."
good,"PNC was an overall good experience, however i did not like the commission structure and felt i can make more money elsewhere with my work ethic. Compensation was worth the amount of work"
good,Not the worst place to be but definitely not ideal. Lots of selling and operational work but a very drab environment. Not advanced yet and not high energy either.
good,"collected on mortgages from 15-120 days delinquency. base of policies of PNC I offered various alternatives to resolve the delinquent accounts. On the escalation help desk, I would take calls from customer heard out their concerns, following PNC policies and procedures to deescalate the calls."
good,"PNC is a good place to start out in the financial career. Unfortunately, there is no career advancement opportunity.  It is a minimal paying salary job."
good,"hours are pretty good if branch is fully staffed."
good,Productive and always a busy branch. Employees are great to work with. Training and meetings are mandatory. Mileage and meetings are paid. Vacations and days off are scheduled in advance.
good,"Typical bank, poor systems, lack of training and poor managers.  They expect everyone to clean up after all the poor transacions that had been put on the books by uncontrolled sales staff in the field, at least as it purtained to the filed sales staff."
good,It is a great job but you have to be able to sell accounts and credit cards everyday and if u don't you get lectured. Your job just isn't about banking its about being a sales person.
good,They're very pushy with sales .  It's like you're almost begging the customer to sign up for a credit card and etc.  I loved my customers and my job.  The only thing that was stressful was sells.  Your job depended on it.
good,"if you have a family, do not work in a call center. once you pick a shift, you have to stick with it and they will barely even consider changing your hours"
good,I work at PNC. I work at PNC. Then I worked at PNC. I have worked at PNC for eight years and the people I work with are nice but people leave jobs because of management.
good,My work experience with PNC was ok. I was a part-time employee. I learned many cash transaction. Work with different kind of people and how to manage stressful environment.
good,Greet customers as soon as they walk into the door!! Just like the Walmart greeters. Help customers with there transaction (aka) fill out there deposit tickets or there withdrawal slips. Or push the customer to use the ATMs or mobile deposit. Have to save the best for last!!!  SELL SELL SELL
good,"Problem Solving"
good,"If you're young, a good place to start a career. Fast changing; must be flexible. Benefits are ok. But it's a large company; individuals can get lost in the crowd."
good,"PNC is a wonderful place to work, typical day at work includes 7 1/2 hours of sitting at a desk taking phone calls assisting customers with issues including online banking support, and regular checking savings account maintenance."
good,I left this company for better advancement and made the mistake of coming back.  I wish I stayed at my old position. What a mistake.  The management does not care about their employees.
good,"Good benefits for the employees, work under sales pressure required to be able to meet manager's expectations. Management can have unrealistic sales goals expectations for their employees."
good,"cashed checks "
good,I worked at PNC for three years. I can say that I enjoyed working for this company. PNC offered me the opportunity to learn different skills to make me a greater asset to the company. They really pushed for people to step in being leaders.
good,This job is a good learning experience for me.  It helped me understand the world of finances a lot more and helped me better maintain my own personal finances.  Some days were harder than others but I believe that is how it would be at any job there will always be ups and downs you just need to learn to work through it.
good,"There was much to love about working here. The facetime with senior level executives was next to none. The work could have been delineated better, but it was a great experience."
good,Large company with opportunity for advancement if you get the right management team. you're able to transfer within company which is a plus. the pay was ok.
good,Very happy with management and work balance. Culture is very distributed as a result of Teleworking.  The most difficult part of the job is adjust to the work requirements including weekends.
good,"PNC was a good place to start and continue a career.  It's a fast paced, time sensitive environment that keeps you on your toes at all times.  The people are the ones that make it go."
good,Really pushes sales to help drive business. Was seasonal so sales goals were hard to meet during the off season since client were seen on a regular bases.
good,"Open accounts, Close Accounts, angry people happy people, Loans, credit card, Ratings from customers, Rude managers, unhappy co-workers, stressed about numbers but always over achieved any goal I set or the company required."
good,"when you go into the job and work its not really hard, its just more of the environment. the management where i work is lazy. when you get slammed you get no help."
good,I learned that being a bank teller was much more work than it appeared to be . In my opinion the position should pay more. The hardest part was feeling I was working to hard for the pay I received .
good,"PNC Bank has a professional work environment. Employees work together under tight deadline to achieve their goals. "
good,This is the same as BNY Mellon as they were bought by BNY Mellon. the culture was the same and management. the hardest part of the job is not having enough employee to do the work. work overload.
good,"I have worked here for almost a year now. It can be very repetitive work experience but the money is good. For someone who was a full-time college student and had internship, I was able to balance it out. They defiantly work with you especially if you are a student."
good,PNC provided great work life balance and job security.  They do not provide much as far as annual increases or bonuses.  They are very flexible with many work from home opportunities.
good,Good job opportunity in retain banking. Gives you opportunities to work with clients face to face and no day is the same. Room for growth good. Friendly employees
good,"Family feel office, nice staff, advanced technology, benefits included, ever growing company, with growth potential, clean environment. pay is not competitive"
good,comparable to other companies in the industry. Nice company and they will help you grow. location depends on your manager. if you get a great that's aw some
good,"As I thrived for excellence and advancement, I ran into the obstacles of my first few weeks of physical training to be nonconstructive and passive at times. As I asked questions, gave my time to learn and be attentive I was more so rather ignored, undervalued and not trained to the best of my potential. PNC offers great benefits and I sacrifice my learning attributes. The company has much to offer but as I started from the ground up my foundation was not at all of that, that PNC I believe truly had to offer all around."
good,"Good place to work - requires a lot of outbound cold calls to customers, very sales driven atmosphere - focus is on customer service, lots of training provided but little on the job"
good,"I was under contract to National City Bank (NCB). It was purchased by PNC which resulted in the termination of more than fifty contracts for professionals who were working on the IT project. Fortunately, the IT project and the buyout occurred at about the same time and I was able to complete my assignment.  Because I never worked for PNC, it would be unfair to review them."
good,"Great Company but Regional was very weak when it comes to Team management and motivation.  Overall the company was great. Loved the CEO and Upper Management overall. I believe message comes wrong when it comes to Regional managers. "
good,Want you to cross sell and push products on a constant basis.  Want you to cold call customers to sell products and services.  I do not feel that is a teller's job.  That job is for management.
good,"Originally PNC was a great place to work, things change ( people, ideas, ect. ), met alot of great people in my time there long gone now,  like alot of Companies out with the old in with the new."
good,"•	Spread the PNC Brand though exemplary customer service which includes lobby management, customer interaction, and local area events"
good,Regulatory environment has changed banking for the worse. Lack of local decision making and reduction of commissions and bonuses have created an undesirable appetite for high performing sales people to remain in banking.
good,Very stressful high pressure tactics over sales and not enough compensation for employees and a lot of favoritism toward some employees when it came to time off. I did meet and develop some great relationships with some of the main customers. Some of the things you were trained to do were constantly changing and the even how you were compensated were constantly changing.
good,"PNC hou are in as changed over the years that I have been there. If school and need a job while you are getting an education, this is a great place to work as the staff at branch level is usually very nice. But with advancement opportunities being limited I would not recommend it for a career."
good,"Developed new investment client base while prospecting current book of bank clients as well as conducting investment seminars."
good,This company sold my division to BNYMELLON. PNC was a good company with good benefits and decent pay.  They take sufficient care of their employees and contractors.
good,"My main job was to handle all money transactions from customers and sell products. When not working with customers, I was required to use online learning tools to learn more about my job."
good,"PNC is a good company to start off with if you are entering the banking industry. Unfortunately there is a lot of ""politics"" in this company. In the position that I am in now (Intl trade service analyst) I am not payed nearly enough. I do my daily responsibilities and they add responsibilities of another department. "
good,Company does not compensate well for all expectations.  They expect you to do the work for 3 individuals and only want to pay you for 1/2 of 1.  If the compensation was greater it would not be so bad.
good,Servicing customers with financial issues as well as selling them different products. I learned over years to love people and interact with them as far as there financial needs is concern. The hardest part of my job is not being able to resolve their financial issues because of fees restrictions and have to tell them that I could not assist them by refunding fees. I enjoyed most to be able to resolve any financial issues that were within my parameters. To see them leave satisfied and happy with my services.
good,Working for PNC has taught me a lot about money management and being able to help the customers as well. As a teller our job is to also meet certain sales goals.
good,"Management at the branches were always supported by the corp. office commission and bonuses were always fair and on time with our paid check . Payd vacations , Holidays , discount employee discounts sales Sales and comminsion were always apropied for the employee"
good,PNC is a decent company to work for. I spent 7.5 years working for this company. Advanced from a personal banker to branch manager. There is Opportunity for career growth and advancement.
good,Diverse workforce close to public transportation. It's in the heart of the city where their a fine eateries and great places to shop.
good,"This is a waste of my time because I have already reviewed PNC Bank.  All I wanted to do was update my resume and now I have been reviewing my previous jobs for 15 minutes, this is none of anyones business how I feel about my past work experiences.  This part should be optional!"
good,"The ACCEL Program is a great start for a young person's career.  There are some drawbacks, but overall it is a nice transition from college to the working world."
good,"Great people to work with, I think the company has the best interest of the consumer in mind. Benefits were probably as good as any other company. All in all a good place to work."
good,"Love working here just need to find something close to home. "
good,"My experience was horrible, management is often involved in small interoffice situation that often can be seen as bullying or using scare tactic to gain the upper hand.  Cant say that the overall experience was all bad but, it was right up there with sweatshop behavior cracking the whip at every turn.  Their ACBS system is a manual input system, which can be overwhelming when training its so much to learn and know all at once.  Needs an upgrade.  Senior management from Pittsburgh, needs replacing. They are learning on the fly."
good,"Revolving door with co-workers, not much opportunity for advancement, low compensation for amount of responsibility & work load, good management at the branch level, benefits available but very expensive, vacation time very regulated."
good,I basically help people take care of there problems by using the equity in there homes. I would help them get a low Apr so that it wouldn't be a problem for them to pay it back.
good,"Productive and adaptability, team player, always on time. work well with others, enjoy learning new things. Love to volunteer. Management is great, co-workers are awesome. Love talking with the customers some are nice, some just don't understand banking."
good,PNC Bank is a great company for anyone wanting to begin a career in the Banking field. I work with a hard-working team and enjoy helping customers reach their financial goals.
good,PNC is a very productive work environment.  Everyday is a learning experience. Great teamwork is the key to work for a common goal and achieved expectations and customer satisfaction.
good,"Typically, I would always run the drive thru at the bank. I learned to be quick and efficient to process customers transaction as they were usually in a hurry.  I did like my management and co-workers as I am still in contact with most of them even after I quit.  They became more than just my co-workers, they became dear friends as well.  The hardest part of the job I would have to say was trying to get referrals in the drive thru because usually people were in a hurry to get in, get out, and get done.  I was able to get some customers to upgrade accounts or get new ones once in a while but when they wanted to get done so quickly, it did make it a little more difficult."
good,"Good place to work, some adjustments could be made. I just do not have a good schedule and hours. Not enough break time. I enjoyed learning new skills that I did not have before beginning employed with PNC."
good,PNC was a great opportunity to start my career after college. I learned how to deal with Face to Face interaction. I loved my time there. Now I am looking for an opportunity to work at a corporate level.
good,"Need to pay more,and not so good healthcare.My manager was great, hands on.I would have still been there if it wasn't for the pay and healthcare."
good,"Great work life balance, and you can work from home a couple of days a week if you work in certain departments. However their compensation for tech workers is pretty low."
good,"*Accountable for over 50 different client bank accounts in 1 day."
good,"It was time for a change, I loved the company, I loved my manager, there is a lack of growth in the company, you can go very far in a few years, I feel like they treat everybody the same, when there are others who deserve a lot more than what they receive"
good,"Polished, professional customer service rep offering:"
good,I enjoyed daily interaction with co-workers and clients. I was very good at sales and service; number 1 teller in Pittsburgh market.
good,Cash Transactions. Setting up accounts and business'. Making referrals. Cash management skills and face to face customer interactions.
good,"good work environment, love my coworkers. however no good advancement opportunities and poor pay. depending on location, you may not have anything to do all day which can be very boring. goals are ok to meet but not the greatest."
good,I would never recommend that someone work here for a long term job. Low pay. Horrible management. Its a stressful job an you don't get paid well enough to do everything you need to do.
good,"I am responsible for meeting sales goals on a daily, monthly and quarterly basis.  Also keeping customer satisfaction in tact.  I work with many other people as one team to reach one goal.  Through my time management and sales skills, I am often able to get the job done."
good,PNC made your work environment very comfortable and enjoyable. You get plenty of space for yourself and others to come and listen to your phone calls as well.
good,PNC used to be a wonderful place to work.  The people were great to work with and the atmosphere was pleasant.  That is no longer the case.  My last manager was a good person but the culture of PNC was cold and unpleasant.
good,PNC is a good work environment. An average day consist of calling on realtors and my bank branch partners and meeting with customers who want to get approved to buy a home.
good,"Tons of experience in a short time, but you are not compensated well. "
good,Small bank branch and no room for advancement. Co-workers were helpful.  Good place as a first job.  Was fun working with customers.
good,"There really was no ""typical"" day at work.  Everyday had a new challenge and lots of variety.  The dynamic culture of this company allowed me to develop outstanding customer service skills, learn how to communicate and how to manage & deal with change.  Had some co-workers that were eager to learn and others just putting in their time.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the politics of such a huge conglomerate.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting and getting to know my customer base and vendors."
good,"I started working for PNC back in september at the call center. It's a very high stress environment and a lot of broken promises. The management is poor and inexperienced. Management should be required to hold a customer service position for at least 6 months before being awarded a Team Lead position. SO many miscommunications happen on a day-to-day basis, especially when it comes to following company procedures and federal law. Definitely not the best bank to work for, but an ok place to start your career or work at later when you've advanced. Get ready for quick 30 minute lunch breaks and staying at adherence."
good,"- Typical day at work was reviewing files for document accuracy"
good,The goals and strategy of the company are there however the technical aspects such as the systems they use to do your job are lagging.  Plenty of opportunity available within PNC.
good,I have been at the company over 3 year at a teller . I really have a lot of experience such as how to communicate with clients well and understand the power of team work.
good,Management for this position wasn't the best. They hired out of the department for supervisor positions which created multiple issues. If you needed explanations on anything you had to bother senior members and interrupt their work as the supervisors had no idea what was going on. Management only knew how to look at charts showing your workload and assign work as needed. Not much help for anything else.
good,Job work/Life balance was great.  However the location I worked for was not easy.  Too many people setting new people for failure.  I felt I always had to watch my work.  Very stressful.
good,"Limited Opportunities for growth and development in the field of retail banking, high turn over in staffing. therefore staff lose interest in working for the company"
good,"for many years was a fun and rewarding place to work"
good,"Bank Teller, I liked working with the numbers, my co-workers were nice to work with,  but  the sales part of the job was not for me. I prefer a more active job."
good,"I am not leaving PNC Bank for any negative reasons, they have displaced about 50 employees telling us it is a business decision. Overall a good place to work."
good,PNC Bank is a financial institution that prides itself on achievement.Everyone strives to ensure client short and long term goals are met.
good,I like the people I work with.  They're a strong team.  Job itself could be better.  Don't get paid enough for the pressure you're under constantly.
good,It was customer service.  At a bank.  There is training and then you work.  Then re-training when the rules change.  I loved helping people.  I hated the red tape and rules designed to hinder helping people.
good,"Some Managers are too dependent on technical people and very uneducated in technology. The managers are depending too much on the technical people and delegating too much, so the manager does whatever the technical people say. So in reality the developers have more power than the manager."
good,"When it comes to an open friendly environment to work in PNC is definitely that. Advancement opportunities are not the best, due to the bank being new to the market. Bonuses were not worth it. One could work like crazy and not recieve what their worth."
good,This is a very strong company. Strong financial planning and sales skills are required. There are opportunities to grow to middle management in the area.
good,"Underwrite risk, recommend credit limits, structure and terms. Underwrite commercial client financial performance, recommend financial strategies for owners to improve efficiencies and margins. I have over 15 years working with commercial clients that I truly enjoy. The banking industry has drasticlly changed due to Dodd Frank and general regulations."
good,"At PNC it can be hard to connect the large mission of the organization with the front lines.  PNC says a lot about finding, developing, and retaining good talent, but the bottom line is that they don't put their money and resources where their talk is. Lately, PNC has been all about cutting expenses and growing revenue. While I completely understand why this is important for any business, the extremes that PNC has taken have limited the ability of its employees and managers to connect and grow. Instead, they've cut employee benefits, salaries for internal candidates are not competitive, and stress on the individual contributor and local managers is through the roof.  The first and second level managers care and want to help grow the individual employees, but they are limited by bureaucracy and red tape.  PNC is the largest company I've worked for, so my comparative experience is limited. I have given PNC the benefit of doubt for so long, but I do feel they could do much better."
good,Overall PNC as a company is not bad to work for. But once you get in to certain positions it is hard to advance from with in or move on to areas that are more interesting.
good,I had a good experience working for PNC but I felt that employees were not valued enough. It was time to move on and find something else.
good,Best job i ever had it's extremly demanding as an in-store consultant however the payouts are amazing and its worth it .. very long hours!!
good,"Strong values that were developed by the employees of PNC years ago. Work life balance is key to the success of the employees. Typical day at work includes engaging both the operations and sales partners together to provide exceptional customer service to our borrowers."
good,This is a good place to get started as a full time job. They offer good benefits and the hours are great. Much room for growth if you want to stay in the banking industry
good,Good employer to gain valuable experience. Good employee recognition and reward/award program. Would recommend for anyone fresh out of college.
good,"Adhere to all reconciliation and balancing procedures and consulting with customers on bank products and services. "
good,"I really enjoyed working at PNC Bank, I was promoted very quickly  from a teller to a personal banker within six months. As a personal banker, I was given the opportunity to work with businesses and decision makers to provide benefits and discounts to their employees.  I eventually moved to business banking,  after 18 months and I always felt  that PNC invested in it's training for their employees and we were able to deliver the best service to our  clients."
good,Productive work environment. Most enjoyable was to be able to work closely with your team members. Co-workers are really nice. You come in and do your job with accuracy and effiency
good,"Under staffed and over worked in some departments , A good ole boy hiring and promoting procedure. Sorry no free Pizza ever!"
good,Its an OK place to work. Some managers are extremely driven and belittle their employees. It's more of a hassle to get things done when a manager is all over your case and you are just tryng to do your job.
good,"This place is good while you are going to school. It is not very demanding job, the only problem is sales that you need to make per month."
good,"Management launches many campaigns without fully completing prior objectives. Needs to have a more standardized methodology to launching company priorities. "
good,Position provides great investment experience and plenty of networking opportunities. Management seems to be in constant cost cutting mode and are just now trying to build company culture.
good,"have learned to multitask in different situaions"
good,"A typical day as a Senior Manager consists of a jam-packed day of multiple meeting usually being double booked.  As one matures in their career, he can determine importance.  A typical day for me was attending these meeting but more important addressing the needs of the companies most important asset.....people."
good,its a good company to work for comes with its share of challenges sales goasl can be high but the financial rewards are great if you can deal with the pressure.
good,"A typical day at work involves planning sales activities, assisting customers with account opening, holding in-depth conversation with customers to identify their financial needs and completing Teller transactions. That aspect of in-depth conversation with customers and valuing their business is something worthy of mentioning. Customers are always top priority. Typically, getting promoted takes longer period, averagely 4 years. Benefit/compensation program is not the best in the industry. Colleagues and management are friendly and fun to work with. If you're a starter in banking, then I recommend. But if you're looking at better compensation and quick promotions, then you're are looking in the wrong direction. There's high attrition rate probably due to compensation and other factors earlier mentioned. But overall, I think it's fun place to start a career."
good,"Lots of rules and regulations."
good,"PNC has been a good company to work for. I have been with the company for 6 months and I don't have many complaints. The few complaints i do have are hours, and management."
good,Great boss & co workers but had to sit in chair the whole shift while keying in the same position and it was a third shift job which was very hard on me to get used to.
good,"Some of the management are decent. The pay and benefits are awful, especially in retail side, not competitive with local banks. Poor  on the job training."
good,when i first started it was national city. they were eventually bought out by PNC bank. very goal driven and customer/goal focused. They do not place much stock in their actual employees. which is sad.
good,"Dependant upon the department or section an employee works for determines the work life balance, compensation, job security, management, and job culture because some are better than others."
good,"A friendly relaxed work environment, however leadership was lacking.  "
good,Sales was the main focus and performance determines how big the bonus is. Scheduling your shift was a plus. A longer Lunch would make performance better and setting attainable performance goals would also be a plus.
good,always tense and very micro managed. Very stressful work environment the breaks and lunches were very short. The most enjoyable part of the job was I had good coworkers and a good help team
good,A typical day work at Wamu was reviewing files and submitting to quality for approval.  The only thing that I did not like about this process is there was not good communication between loss mit and quality.
good,"High energy Financial Professional with mutual fund experience and education. Proven expertise in management, strategic and financial planning, analysis, and reporting. Astute, performance-driven business strategist highly accomplished in successfully managing business development and marketing initiatives to increase revenue streams for maximum return-on-investment (ROI). High level of integrity and dependability with a strong sense of urgency and commitment."
good,This is the place I had great experience on Retail Banking. Great customer experience and enjoyed learning new things and meeting new people. I was happy that I could help many people and help them reach their financial goals.
good,Stable IT environment with good leaders. Lots of opportunities to learn and grow within the different areas of the bank.
good,I loved the company it's benefits and everything that I was able to learn there from coworkers and management but the pay is not good.
good,PNC did try to appreciate their employees.  They even had a week where they did things for the employees.  I have no complaints about working here.  It was nice to have holidays off.  I would recommend this company to someone looking for a job
good,"Didnt work here for long. Project work and a bland environment. People rarely talked to eachother, but thats just where I was at. This was the corporate building, not a branch."
good,"•	Advised customers on banking options that are available to them."
good,"Sustained pressure to meet production targets. "
good,"I love working for PNC. However, the only position available at the time was part-time. I need full-time hours."
good,"Working at PNC is good experience for multi-tasking and talking to customers from all walks of life.  I learned how to stay organized, and provide excellent customer service.  As well, I learned how to help people with their everyday finances."
good,"It's not a bad company to work for. Employees get treated well. Insurance benefits are average. Salary is a bit lagging. My experience with advancement is difficult within the company, unless your someone's favorite. Even if you have the skillset and experience."
good,Great Place To Work. Great Quality Products and your expectations are laid out for you from day 1.
good,"I would get to my job at 8 in the morning and get off at 4 in the afternoon. I would deal with paying the bills, cash the customers checks, withdraw money from accounts, work with cds, help with customers if they need to get to their safety deposit boxes, waited on customers, did reports. I learned how to save money and when it is good to use it and when not to use it. The co-workers were very pleasant. The hardest part of the job was to make sure that everyone go their money right. The most enjoyable part of the job was laughing and communicating with the customers."
good,"Accountability and responsibility are passed from one person to the next making it hard to achieve."
good,"Typical day at work - logging on, checking emails, begin assignment."
good,This is a layback job experiance. Good for if you are in school or have another job.
good,Working for this company had its con's and pro's just like any other job. I learned a lot and PNC overall is a good company to work for.
good,"Is an okay work environment, always depends on branch and management team"
good,"Clerical work, I have learned attorney docs how to foreclose on some ones home, loan processor, co-workers were wonderful people. The hardest part of my job was being laid off, I enjoyed the most was the great group of people that I shared my eight hours a day with."
good,Accepted retail and commercial deposits. Balanced foreign currency. Promoted bank's products and services.
good,"Loan officer, take application talk to customer, price loans"
good,"PNC Bank is a robust and advancing competitor in the finance industry. It was recognized as an employee-centric company by many standards. However, actual workers there may believe otherwise. This fast-paced, demanding job may exhaust your quality of life (which is a key component of their core values). The benefits package appears to be substantial on paper until they're necessarily utilized. Yet, an assitance program with average resources can mainly rectify and ameliorate some of these issues. Overall, PNC's compensation alongside requirements is not commensurable, though with the dynamic managing personnel any individual will flourish."
good,"Great job if looking for fast paced place of work"
good,"I work with a good group of co workers. I have learned many new things for this job, independent of any job training."
good,"My overall rating for my position at PNC Bank is 50/50, the company is still making changes do to the bank merger with National City."
good,"Very nice people, overall a nice place to work.  Sometimes have to work long hours, can be stressful , but that comes with any job in finance and banking."
good,"*Worked a great effective team!"
good,worked my way up from a teller to being the assistant head teller within a year
good,"A typical day includes lots of research "
good,"I can see how some people might like it, but sitting down all day and making 10,000 calls per weeks for 40 hours wasn't my cup of tea."
good,I liked working at PNC because there was always something to do.
good,"Learned a lot, its an important job, glad for the experience"
good,"I learned a lot because I am curious. Manager is always giving you more tasks. Co-workers are fun to work with. Hardest part is to work 6 days a week, but no overtime. No work/life balance. The most enjoyable part of the job is make customer happy."
good,"If you have a college degree ( major Business/Finance/Accounting etc) the only reason you should even take this position is for the steady paycheck while you: take classes on the side and/or look for a more lucrative position.  That is unless you are one of those crazy people that enjoy retail banking.. "
good,Tons of opportunity to start. Salary restriction. Opportunity to advance diminishes.
good,"A typical work day would be assisting customers with hew accounts, making deposits, and withdraws."
good,The job is ok if you could get enough hours to pay to drive into work.
good,"Overall PNC is a good place to work. However, they have a tough compensation package for entry level employees aspiring to gain a higher position. If you start off on the low end of a salary range, more than likely you will stay there no matter how many promotions you recieve."
good,"Powerful Bank that has a lot of potential in the Atlanta area, but needs to be more selective with the choosing of their executive leadership in the market."
good,Productive and challenging Worked with the public one on one as well as on the phone. I had the opportunity to work with people from all walks of life. I believe this is my strength.
good,"It was so/so, nothing major to say good or bad.  It was a basic job and the managers/fellow employees were ok."
good,"•a typical day at work"
good,Overall good as can be expected nothing over the top. It was a learning experience and rewarding to gradually grow with the company in time.
good,Management is helpful.  Training is good but once you are up and running you are on your own.
good,Good firm wasn't there long enough to have a fair assessment.
good,"Enjoyed the people I worked with"
good,"As part of the large financial institution working with small business owner, I managed financial sales team. It was a pleasure to assist small business owners develop their businesses/"
good,"A typical day consists of working daily reports sent by management, following up with attorneys via email and telephone communications in regards to foreclosure actions, keep open line of communication with various departments within the company to obtain necessary information to move forward with foreclosure."
good,"I have a job and I can feed my family. In the end, its not what you got but what you gave, not what you bought, but what you built. Family is  all that matters."
good,PNC has a great culture for recruiting those wanting to excel and do things right.
good,The work itself is alright. The management team is inept. The amount of work required does not match the pay.  I learned a lot in working independently.  Basic days include greeting customers and daily transactions.
good,"Good for a college student or someone who doesnt want to advance in the banking field, typical day was busy a lot of pressure to perform well but no reward for doing so."
good,"* Good for learning"
good,"So much to do."
good,"Collect ATM deposits, post them to accounts, wait on customers in which I wouls either cash checks, or take deposits.  Co workers were nice, most enjoyable would be talikng to customers"
good,"The time I started working at PNC,  they were merging with the Mercantile Bank which I was working at and I stayed there and was hard and fun."
good,Had great and friendly co-workers. The customers were also very nice and pleasent to work with. The company focus on sales more than anything else. The turnover is also horriable.
good,It can be a good place to work with the proper management and if they could keep the branches staffed properly.
good,Worked hard to make the best of a hard situation in a Department That was closing. Had the pleasure of  working with some great people who worked hard to make a monotonous job a pleasant experience.
good,Traditional bank: not a lot of advancement opportunities for minorities once a certain level is attained.
good,"As any banking job, it can get stressful with rules and regs, but it is a fun and rewarding job"
good,"lack of training made it hard to manage an office that had little to no experienced staff."
good,I answer between 100 and 120 calls a day. This job is a very high level of stress. We have to be consistant with every customer that calls in and to help them achieve their financial goals.  I enjoy helping the customers with their banking needs. The hardest part of this job is having to tell a customer no that we are unable to refund fees from them. 
good,"good company to work for, high priority on work life balance."
good,In my position as a WorkPlace FSC it was my job to take the bank into the business.  
good,"ability to build relationships, learn new skill sets and move within organization"
good,Working on a fast pace and utilizing three or more tools to assist customers on outbound and inbound calls. Working as a team and individually to improve customer service. 
good,"I work with some of the best coworkers I have ever had, my managers are very supportive as well.  The downside is we are understaffed and the job is too sales oriented."
good,"A typical day consists of constant face to face interaction with clients. There is never a dull moment. Because of high volume traffic, this gives me the opportunity to uncover many referral opportunities within the client base, which is also part of the job. The hardest part is meeting your goals and having to balance many aspects at once, however I work best under pressure."
good,"Opportunities to try something new. Encouraged to shift your focus every year or so. Teams worked closely with each other. Individuals stepped up to take on task areas. ""I'll take that"" was often heard in cross-team meetings. Benefits were very good as well."
good,Sold bank products
good,"Building & growning. Lots of coaching & customer service. Training about all new products. Hours are pretty good, vacation."
good,Good company not the greatest compensation for the work you have to do
good,"However, hard to advance or move around internally. I've met several good friends and mentors while working here."
good,I represent 4 Regional Managers and their client portfolios. Three of the Managers are based in Southern New Jersey and PA. I am responsible to ensure that all their loan transactions are conducted in a timely manner.
good,• Maintain and improve customer relations
good,"high-volume, inbound call center. great managers and co-workers. very high volume of calls, meeting call handle time requirements is difficult."
good,A typical day could be anything from putting out fires or creating policies and procedures for the staff. I learned how to create a Team enviornment taking all quality points from each staff member and integrating within the department.
good,Company closed down branch. But a good company to work for. Flexible hours.
good,"As a in-store sales consultant you are a teller, financial consultant, and a mortgage adviser. Work environment being in-store is very hectic and the turnover is high with employees."
good,"Very stressful, I learned alot about Real Estate Services but my forte was being an Executive assistant. The Senior Exec.retired so they did away with my position so I moved on with my career."
good,"Typical work day was board meetings, typing memos and doing anything administrative. Management was forever changing."
good,started early and ended when the work was complete and the deadlines were met.
good,-Benefits : are great I can say that but could be better.. I would say that is probably one of the best things about the job.
good,"If you work for instore, you are a sales person. You are required to get customers in the aisle and try to get them to switch to PNC, you are required to spend two to four hours a day in the aisle. All your interactions can be surveyed by Gallup and you must recieve a 4.8 and up. Go into the position knowing that you are a sales person not a teller, etc."
good,I believe PNC is a good company who emphasizes on pleasing their customers.
good,"I was hired as a LFSC which is just a fancy way of saying a licensed personal banker. My time was supposed to be 60% retail banking and 20% investments. My branches assigned Financial Advisor viewed me as his personal secretary/assistant even though he was supposed to be mentoring and grooming me to become a financial advisor. After sitting in four of his appointments I soon realized he had no idea what he was talking about and often made up his background and history in the financial world to set clients at ease. My manager and my Financial Advisor would get into arguments about who was ""truly in charge of me"" and it quickly felt like I was a number and not a valued employee. Of course it would of helped if there was a clear definitive job description out there for my position from the bank, there wasn't. The job description was very vague and was left open to interpretation by management. Management was very much the byproduct of a previous acquisition of a prior bank. Some management from TWO acquisitions ago. Bottom line those banks got bought out for a reason and a lot of the prior management lack the customer service and sales balance that the company so rightfully has earned in prior awards and review. The company itself is OUTSTANDING but it's employee base needs to be reviewed and weeded out. All the way through to HR. One representative in particular. The whole branch pretty much turned a teller in for incentive fraud as she was fraudulently getting credit. For referrals. The manager had no backbone (his own self admittance that he would much rather motivate than to"
good,I had several positions during my time at PNC. I enjoyed working with customers.
good,"While I enjoy working at PNC Bank, the room for growth and advancement within my specific work location is very limited. I enjoy the challenges that my position awards me wich makes it easy to complete my work day effortlessly. As a team, the whole department works together to meet daily deadlines with a friendliness and helpfulness that creates an atmosphere of pride in what we all do. The hardest part of my position is the occasional lack of work to be completed. While I would love to continue my position with PNC Bank, unfortunately, our entire processing site will be phased out in the near future due to new technologies introduced to the bank. As I continue to view other positions with the company, I am also exploring other possible opportunities outside of PNC."
good,The analyst and operators are overall great to work with. The managers need to learn not to micro manage and speak to employees. PNC would be a great place to work for if people learn to work together instead of against each other
good,Meets expectations with concentrated efforts on productivity
good,The hardest part of the job is to stay kind and sweet while being berated and cussed out by borrower's.
good,A great institution that grew too large too quickly to provide the level of service expected by a top tier Private Bank and Wealth Management firm.
good,Over all PNC is a great place to work but loss prevention is horrible. If you have an overage or shortage don't expect back office or loss prevention to help you find your mistake. Management varies at every branch and some are supportive while others do nothing but hold you back. Besides that the customers are great and it's a good stepping stone career wise. The most enjoyable part was you all learn to work as a team when things get crazy but the hardest part is moving up in the company.
good,I loved working the second shift. The benefits were good. I enjoyed working with my co-workers in the department in which I worked. There wasn't anything that was hard about the job. Management did provide good training for the positions that I worked. The most enjoyable part of the job was my working hours.
good,"A typical day at work here is very fast paced. I worked in the credit card department, where we took inbound calls. These calls would range anywhere to as easy as giving a polite person their balance to problem solving and working with upset customers."
good,"I had great management, however unfortunately lately they have been hiring externally more than promoting internally. Also several co-workers have been let go due to minor kyc violations. assistant branch managers are being laid off in regions and communication is horrible."
good,"A typical l day at work sually begins with determining how much work is due to the day (in accordance with Standrda Leval Agreements previously set forth). Throughout the day the workload is monitored, any escalated issues from Client Servcies Officers are addressed, I atten various any meetings and assist my staff with any cahllenges they may encounter."
good,I Thank God for it! I enjoy going to work everyday. I'm responsible for keying Medical Claims EOB's for a local hospital.
good,"PNC Mortgage is a quality company in the fast paced mortgage industry. PNC is one of the leading financial institutions in the world, however yet very conservative."
good,"Culturally rich organization with long traditions in banking, customer service and asset management. Employees seem generally pleased, but marginally under-compensated relative to industry medians."
good,It was a pretty decent job  just make sure you stay on your P’s and Q’s very strict they will terminate you without  question  The calls were back to back your basically busy 24/7 needed more down time not enough breaks
good,"My day consisted of managing staff, monitoring reports, working with HR, hiring/firing/laying off staff, monitoring for improvements or concerns within processes and meetings with upper management and other management."
good,I was not necessarily an indivisible for the overarching company. My branch was wonderful but the company as a whole did not care about me or the staff I worked with.
good,PNC is an excellent company to work for if you are Sales driven and are able to meet sales quotas. In my opinion PNC values their sales over the client/customer service experience.  I was able to incorporate my love of teaching financial wellness to our customers which didn't always lead to a sale and this was not always accepted even if it was right for the customer. frowned
good,"Training is ongoing.  Very involved duties, training by coworkers.  Unfortunately, the training is not conducive to being mentored on the job with your trainer sitting with you, and you are dealing with customers and not completely comprehending how to best assist them.I have been told to ""read the manual"" which you have to search a 50+ page binder that is not labelled for easy searching, and if you are totally New to the business, some of the terms used in the manual make understanding difficult."
good,Not going to write a full review on my company.  Over the past 10 years it has been a great place to work and I feel it is time to move on and leverage my skills in other organizations
good,"Too long of a work day"
good,I was making  monthly  incentive  and  when you  got on  the list  for CD REVIEW you were on  your  way  out  thats what happened in  march  2019    they  let  go 25%  of there workforce just when  business was picking up??  Now all the other employees  are working long  hours  and MANDATORY  OT.. REALLY  WHAT  HAPPENED TO  A WORK  LIFE BALANCE??
good,"Days would sometimes be long, and management seemed to make you want to do way more than a loan officer would need to. I feel that we would end up processing a lot of the process, and many times having to calculate things ourselves instead of getting help from underwriting."
good,The company placed too much work on the mortgage loan officer to handle the majority of the loan processing responsibilities while at the same time not compensating  the loan officer fairly for the work performed.
good,"Training did not prepare you for day to day issues. Not prepare to open appropriate accounts for individuals."
good,The company was great when I first started but changed a lot of the last several years after the other large bank got into trouble and fined! Not as fun as it used to be all about numbers all the time
good,"There were a lot of nice and knowledgeable people who were willing to help teach new employees.  Some of the management were good to work for, but there were some exceptions."
good,The company itself is great!! Amazing benefits. The hours are horrible and posting out takes forever. Working from home is an option but you have to pay for the internet and phone. You are like a desk jockey and can hardly get up. The attendance policy is harsh.
good,"I have been very fortunate to have a terrific work/life balance, due in part to my ability to work remotely.  However, my salary hasn't budged since joining the company 6 years ago.  I joined near the top of my salary grade, and unfortunately the scale has not moved during my time here.  Bonuses have decreased annually while health care costs have risen, resulting in net pay decreases or flat salary annually."
good,"worked 8 years as a service partner then 5 as an actual employee,"
good,"Decent company to work for.  Unfortunately with most large companies there is an epidemic of ""not my job"" when asking for assistance from other departments."
good,I need you to apply and work for yourself and see for yourself. At first it was great to work here but after two years I do not see any room to grow!.
good,Not a bad place to work but training for new products not long enough. Company would put you directly on the phone when you were not sure or comfortable with new product which would cause customers to become frustrated and angry. Customers felt you did not know what you were talking about.
good,PNC is a great place to start a career. The pay is a little lower than average but the experience and amount of skilled bankers and managers is worth it for early career starters.
good,"Global PMI moderated for a fifth consecutive month to its lowest level in nearly two years. Although the measure remains above the neutral rate of 50, distinguishing economic growth and contraction, recent dollar strength and continued trade uncertainty could weigh on manufacturing."
good,"Management differs heavily between branches. There are a handful of managers who are willing to work with individuals to seek advancement. Most however, either dislike interviewing or are too comfortable with their over inflated bonuses to be willing to risk helping you get promoted and in the process loosing some of that incentive with the new hire. The claim they pride themselves on promoting from within but as with most banks you will quickly find that they outside hire often. The only normal internal promotions are within branches when there is again zero risk to the branch manager and their bonus."
good,"very laid back at the Brecksville office."
good,"My front desk receptionist position was okay. They wanted me to help with insurance calls on their financed equipment, but I was not fully trained and they claimed they were short staffed.  I finally told them I did not feel comfortable making these calls as I did not know what I was suppose to be requesting and when asked questions from agents, I really didn't know what to say."
good,"Pay was good.  Management was OK, but they didn't communicate well with us.  Too many meetings and not enough tellers to cover on busy days.  Goals were fair."
good,"Very Competitive environment, pushed to get goals, very stressful working in a 100% commission job, finding clients to sell too, and finding the right customers."
good,"I went in to the job trying to escape the typical retail work environment, only to encounter more of the same problems one would find at other retail jobs."
good,"Great Culture, Boring Job, Zero Advancement, Never Paid Well. If you are not a go getter, you'll love working here. You are a minion, and are treated as such. Definitely a white male executive culture."
good,"While I am thankful PNC hired me in after I had been laid-off from my previous 16-year tenure with a local University, I did not realize just how much stress is involved with this position. I understand having carry-over to some extent, but in this job you never catch up to current, you are always behind, and for me that is stressful. It's all about the numbers and production. I consider the benefits to be pretty good, with exception of the sick/occasional leave."
good,The last few years were very stressful and the work needed to keep pace with the workload was excessive.  Working until 9 or 10 pm in the office and working at home until 3 am was common.
good,"Working as a teller at PNC Bank was one of the most stressful jobs I have ever worked. I worked at one of the busiest branches in the Washington, D.C. area. Management didn't care how the employees felt about certain things and they were always pushing you to produce with no incentive."
good,"Employees are well trained to be great customer service ambasadors and state of art money handling process. Learn"
good,Mostly people employed are of great character. Management is helpful but also restricted. Too much information is given at one time and employees are still expected to excel with very little time to grasp the work.
good,"The people were very nice. The working environment was fine. The pace was non-stop. But, working at the call center was not a good fit for my situation. T"
good,"PNC Bank is a great place to work; however, the potential for job advancement is difficult for someone wishing to not work in a customer-facing environment in the Chicago Market."
good,"when I started there was extensive training and the thought of helping individuals grow their finances, after a few months it became more about sales and getting production. main focus is on pushing, instead of financial wellbeing"
good,"Previous role of WorkPlace Sales Consultant in Dayton, Oh had great management and incentive.  PNC changed incentive to poorly focused.  My last role I took due to relocation to Naples, Florida.  Poor management, poor and changing to worse compensation"
good,"I have always like my job but it got to a point that I was no given the chance to learn new things or advance.."
good,"I worked at PNC after a recent merger with RBC. The PNC culture was much different. Several of the tenured employees from RBC seems to really have trouble with this change. Also, PCG was new to Alabama. There were some growing pains with getting this line of business rolled out successfully."
good,Very high sales expectations and the products change constantly.  A lot of employee turnover causing staff shortage constantly.  Strict business dress code.
good,Work life Balance is not balanced to well.  The majority of my weekends I would often find myself having to put my family to the side to satisfy PNC and any additional free time / family time i would have to commit to PNC related activities.
good,okay place to work.  The company has room for advancement but make it very hard to do.  The employees made it fun to work for the company.  I learned a lot from my supervisor and manager.
good,"PNC Bank is a good place to work but the pay is bad.  Beyond that the benefits are good, the management is good, and the Job Work/Life Balance is alright."
good,This job helped me inhance my computer skils and strengthen my typing abilities. The environment is ok and the peers are great and helpful. Everyone des their best to maintain.
good,I will not rate this company at this time due to I am currently employed there. There are a lot of good reasons to work for pnc but there are also a down side as well
good,Dont start this job if you dont like being on the phone. there is room for advancement but it is based on your call scores. You must work a minimum of 20 hours and they will not allow you to work less and stay an employee.
good,great place to work to get banking experience with good benefits get to grow and move up in the company quickly. friendly coworkers and management overall good place to work
good,"I really enjoy the people I work with and the atmosphere that my peers would create.  My immediate supervisor was good to work with as well.  Maybe not as hands on as what is needed, but assisted in other ways.  The problem is the goals.  There is still what I call a ""Wells Fargonian"" mentality driven by our upper management to push products, hit monthly and quarterly selling goals and not ever talk or concern themselves about the incredible service we provide, but rather how much money did we make the company."
good,I had a great branch manager and district manager. Just way too much put on your plate. A lot to know and many many jobs to do. PNC Bank is cutting corners everywhere and putting the burden on their underpaid employees.
good,"the branch managers are good, mine is helpful."
good,The program was designed to teach you how to run a bank from the cosumer and business sides. The hardest part was retaining all the information you had to learn and the most enjoyable part was traveling to all the different headquaters for trainings.
good,"Processing department was very slow, had many deals die while being processed. Pay rate was low, benefits as far as health and vacation were good. Work atmosphere was good."
good,"There's a lot of room to grow, but upper management micro manages you. There's hundreds of calls, sales goals are not optional, the benefits are terrible."
good,"PNC tries it's best to be flexible, but with such a large staff, the rules tend to not bend at all. Even in emergency situations. The call center environment is tedious, and requires someone who doesn't mind being on the phone and looking at a computer all day. For the most part, the calls are the same questions over and over again. Although a few times a day you will get very irate customers, and have to let it slide off your back and not take it personally."
good,loved working at pnc only because of my coworkers . Very low pay with a lot of responsibility . Wouldn't promote to full time but would have me working 39.5 hours weekly .
good,Micro managing metric environment which is great if your in a role that requires it.  This blanket agenda doesn't cater to jobs that are not metric (widget) based.
good,"My work day consist of assisting customers with all financial needs, from simple deposits to applying for loans. It also includes following regulations and being very independent. I enjoyed working with customers and helping them better their financial situations. The environment was welcoming and the most enjoyable part of the job was always learning something new. In the world of banking your job doesn't just teach you the details of how to accomplish banking needs but develops your way of thinking. You are constantly problem solving and working on building your character. The hardest part of my job was being understaffed."
good,"PNC Bank as a whole is a nice company to work.  Benefits 401K, paid sick days, paid vacation days and holidays, HSA, and education benefits."
good,It was fast paced job and learned how to deal with different kind of people and their needs. Management was very flexible but also kept us on our toes by giving different challenges. Overall it was fun place to work.
good,"Training is mediocre and a lot of times you are just thrown into your position with little to no help from another branch employee. Pay is just OK, benefits are decent."
good,Working for PNC Bank is an in store environment is not the typical banking work environment. You do a lot of sales and selling products. Mostly customer interactive and pushing PNC products
good,get on ur computer get everything brought up an ready for calls weekly meetings daily huddles inbound and outbound calls. collecting for their mortgages payments if past due set up repay plans or get them further assistant. hardest part is sitting in a chair for like 10 hours. some management is more helpful than other earn monthly bonues
good,A typical day was visiting my business customers and determining if their accounts were in order and reviewing their current products to see if they are best serving their needs. I would try to visit at least 8-10 bank customers per day and always make time for cold calls . The hardest part of the job was to convince the customer that they needed more of anything. Goals were tough for everyone to achieve based upon your area. PNC was the most technologically advanced company I ever worked for. You had to be on your game and computer literate to keep up with their technology . PNC was ahead of their time.
good,"PNC is a great place to bank, I still bank with them. One of the lowest paying banks to work for in Traverse City, with a company who prefers to hire outside the company then promote within.  Upper Management have good insight and promote the brand well."
good,"Good company to work for.  Good benefits and fair pay. Company has a professional atmosphere. Good management, managers are open and will to help employees grow and develop."
good,The branch i was at was hostle but the people are nice in thier own way the hours are reasonable but in terms of hours they expect so much from the workers for very. Little benifit
good,While the overall organization is better than most big banks there have been multiple compensation changes and downsizings in the last year.
good,"Working for PNC was good for the most part, I think every job will not be that perfect job, but you take the good with the bad, look forward and not back, do your job to the best of your ability."
good,"A teller position is a good place to start if you want to work through school, or plan to move up in the banking industry. There is plenty of room for advancement and raises."
good,Each day involves different tax tasks to complete daily.Efficient filing of applicable tax returns is annual goal. Need more managers to allow employees to conform to policies and procedures.Co-workers very sociable and well mannered and best part of job.
good,"Pushes sales, you do not bonus with out meeting sales goals, do not receive raise if you do not meet sales calls, bankers have to cold call."
good,"There are numerous job opportunities in lower levels, but advancing is difficult unless you get in to a mentoring program.  The company is a major financial bank in the United Status."
good,Loved this job and the people I worked with. Not much opportunity for career advancement at he branch level. Overall a great place to start my banking career.
good,"To scripted to clients, numbers driven environment to work. Small raises. Stressful environment and audits."
good,Very customer focused.  Worked with business owners and prospects to sell multiple products to help make their businesses run more efficiently.  Management was very top down driven.  I had a very good relationship with co-workers/partners.  The hardest part was meeting the very demanding sales goals.  The most enjoyable part was the customer interactions and helping the business owners.
good,"Nice building and space to work in. Very friendly people. PNC puts you though a very thorough training called PNC University and it is intense and gives you all the tools to be successful. "
good,"Company went from loose and fun environment to overbearingly corporate. Trying to imitate ""the Chase way"" and causing increasing stress on loan officers and management. Management is increasingly pressured to push above and beyond compliance measures. Even so, company was completely unprepared for the advent of TRID regulations. No real plan in place for consumer direct lending when the HARP program expires at end of 2016. My direct reporting manager was fair and friendly, but other two managers were poor fits. One was not prepared to lead a team, the other let personal feelings and perceived threats to his reputation impede his managing."
good,"The schedule is pretty solid knowing exactly when you'll be working and what time you get off is a plus. Always 40 hours. One hour lunch is always a plus however is not paid for(not that I expect it to be). Paid holidays and sick days. The  only thing is that working here is not compatible with someone living on their own especially supporting children. The company expects to receive more than what they put out. If you want your employees to be the best you need to have something to put out, to motivate them. Health benefits are ridiculous, very expensive. There is no room for advancement and if there is any it is extremely hard to reach. They tend to hire from outside rather than promote from within. Getting a raise is extremely difficult and starting pay is not well."
good,"Client-centered company, truly concerned about clients' well-being.  Benefits are good, work/life balance excellent.  Good working conditions, great fiscal policies."
good,"Enjoyed the relationship with my peers, however it felt very segregated between teams. Managers often felt too superior and spent much time on personal work. I can vouch for it, because I sat next to my team lead and she was taking personal calls all day for her other job."
good,"Management and peers at PNC are great.. PNC has selected some awesome people to work here. But on the downside the pay structure could be much better. I have compared my current role's salary to that of another company's HR Specialist role and at midpoint, I am almost $20,000.00 below that mark. Also PNC could be more involved in the fitness of it's employees."
good,"I call attorneys"
good,PNC is a good place to get started in sales. They have a great work life balance schedule and many branches to choose from.
good,"Management- A very motivated and dedicated individual who is takes great pride in everything I do. Always willing to learn and work as a team. I am always ready to take on a challenge as well as overcome it. "
good,"-Cared about the financial well being of its customers"
good,PNC is a productive and fun place to work with limited opportunity for growth. I loved my co workers and the work but felt I was stuck and felt unfulfilled.
good,"Great management and team, however I need something more flexible which will provide a better home/ work balance and less commute."
good,"As a Senior Documentation Administrator I was responsible for validating the receipt of and filing commercial loan documentation.  I serviced our internal and external partners across various lines of business by fulfilling copy requests, validation of original documents, file pulls and processing the temporary release of files to the Asset Resolution Team and PNC legal.  Additional responsibilities included imaging and data entry of commercial loan documents.  These functions were performed using a variety of systems.  Extremely rigid accountability standards made it difficult to work under pressure to meet daily service levels and deadlines. As a strong team player, I found the most enjoyable part of the job was establishing a level of trust among teammates while forming lasting relationships."
good,"rally a team to find opportunity in existing clients financial needs"
good,The culture within the store was fun and challenging.  My colleagues were all friendly and helpful.  The upper management seemed to contradict their own directives making it hard for store management to react and be as productive as they would like.  The store was also overstocked with merchandise making it hard for customers to shop.  The quality of the merchandise was very good.  The department managers were all dedicated people that were willing to help one another.
good,fun place to work but there are to many changes to frequently. good management. good co workers. good experience. pays low.
good,"ona regular day you would be answering phone calls concerning PNC account holders about overdraft refunds, balances, online banking or any other type of banking question. I've learned a lot about everyday banking and step to prevent an overdraft from occuring. The co workers are amazing and are the most help when it comes to questions, whereas I found it very difficult to find a manager to answer questions or take an escalated phone call. But it pays very well and the hours are decent, plus you have every holiday off. The only downside is you have to be okay with hear customers cry or yell on the phone while still denying their request but if you can get over that your perfect."
good,"Pnc is a great company to work for if you don't stay in the same position for to long. The company has great programs for customers an great products. Would look into the workers more for the great work they put in, should be rewarded more."
good,PNC has a great work culture and it is great for a person who is beginning there career in banking. The ability to advance is great and they are willing to train you so you can grow. The only con is the compensation and working weekends.
good,PNC has a good work/life balance and decent benefits. Good place to start in the financial world too with the ability to move up
good,"Generally stress-free work environment but compensation is below market. There is not too much emphasis on higher education, the CFA exams are not reimbursed."
good,"Quality management, good benefits, caring professionals, desire for success.  Challenges related to compliance and proven production."
good,I really enjoy working with the public. Management did not carry the title well. Relationships with certain employees were more personal than professional.
good,"Good job If you are looking for a temporary job to add some qualifications on your resume. Nice community bank,  great hours, okay incentives."
good,I would got to work and help people with their mortgage.  I also setup tax buckets and help them with payment plans so that they could keep their homes.  That was very rewarding.
good,"Excellent and Productive, Team player and Good Customer Service."
good,"Some of my daily responsibilities include providing information to help internal service partners with regulatory, system, product and policy disputes related to retirement accounts. Train peers on department procedures, IRS regulations, legal documentation requirements, products, features, benefits, software, and information systems. Also, organize and prepare original documents for retention and storage and fulfilling document requests as well as quality controlling documents for completeness."
good,"Pros- Coworkers, work/life balance, hours, "
good,"answering customer calls, dealing with financial accounts and products."
good,"My day typically begins by working on scheduling, and follow up with Pre-planned appointments for the day. This is usually represented by about 90 percent Self Sourcing, and some Company Leads. I then spend about 1-2 Hours max reviewing my Pipeline Report for my existing Loans I am working on, and communicating directly with my Processor in follow up with my Clients. By 1pm, I am out on a direct Route I have established for myself, meeting and greeting with my Realtor base of around 20-25 Agents within a given week. I continue to build their Loyalty, and pull in Business for PNC. I cultivate multiple relationships within a given transaction from the Borrower, to the both the Seller, and Buying Agents all the way to the Closings with the Title Company. I usually average 4-5 Applications Per week that convert to 5-10 Closed Transactions Per Month. I love my job, but I simply need a new challenge in Sales."
good,"Mostly 8-5, Management tends to works long hours. Company does offer work from home for professional positions usually 2 days a week. Most  co-workers are nice, but are under a lot of pressure, because of banking regulations. The building has an onsite cafeteria with flat screen TV's.  There are some offices, but most people are in cubicles."
good,"I worked here for a couple months, I loved my job because of my customers, and security. I really dislike the management. It's very hard to do anything at this job without the right person to say something or directing you in a wrong way."
good,inbound customer service helping customer with their mortgage making payments reviewing and ordering loan documents
good,"Opening the bank ,lobby management and greeting every client and thanking them when they where leaving for banking with us. Would interact with clients with sales and service issues. Also continued education on bank product and services and bank regulations as well as cash audits. The best part of my job was helping clients attain their financial goals."
good,Family oriented department.  Made you feel welcome every day
good,I love the company for there values and how they manage the consumers money. My pull back from this company is how the manage there employees and the lack of care
good,Sales are all that matter. Large company where the average employee gets lost and can't really move up anywhere. Bad hours.
good,"Nothing is in black and white - rules are made up as you go. Compensation is pitiful, unless your a branch manager or higher. It was okay for the time I was there, but I wouldn't recommend it to a friend."
good,"Basically, working in my department of PNC is like being in high school all over again... actually, it's worse. You're not supposed to have extensive conversations with your coworkers, if any at all. You have to keep track of every little thing that you do in a ""productivity database."" People tell on each other, instead of resolving issues with themselves. Team leads (one in particular) thinks she's the ""punisher"", and enjoys bossing people around and reporting them for petty occurrences. "
good,Growth of the company offers greater opportunity. The financial institution offers much in the way of financial diversity.
good,"Very busy with a very large number of customers, I learned the"
good,Good upper management but lack of career development opprotunities and very difficult to progress.
good,It's an okay entry-level position. You do have to deal with management running the branch as if it were their own and not the company's. Besides that you do have to posses the ability to provide excellent customer service.
good,"Teller Supervisor: Manage and perform teller transactions in the areas of checking and savings deposits and withdrawals. Schedule, mentor, and train tellers. Execute cash audits for tellers and vault. Order and distribute cash from Federal Reserve Bank. Balance Teller accounts. Conduct credit and fraud analyses; investigate and resolve account/transaction discrepancies, errors, and omissions. Ensure compliance with Federal, Bank, and security policies."
good,"Reqired to work under high stress situations and short staffing. I have learned to manage people and keep a balance of happiness and accountability. My co workers are fantastic. The hardest part of the job is the constant change in policy and procedure, though it is not unmanagable. The most enjoyable part of the job is the knowledge of knowing that I am needed and respected for my position."
good,My time in the mortgage industry had it ups and downs.
good,"Limited advancement in certain markets.  Unrealistic work expectations.  Multiple demands, most are often unreachable.  They claim they are diverse and inclusive but they arent."
good,Ever  changing  rules  and  laws  make  performance  expectations somewhat  unrealistic. Constant  pressure  to  hit  goals  with many variables  impeding  you.
good,The job is great for paying your bills. It’s  $15.50 an hour which is meh. I say this considering I was being paid the same amount as a hostess for a restaurant and I received much better benefits and incentives there. Your co-workers on the same level as you can quickly become friends. People are down to earth but Favoritism is definitely strong with job titles. Opportunity to grow. Convenient
good,"Not the best job. Not the worst. Pays the bills. The culture and middle management could use some work, but otherwise the job is rather fair in the compensation you receive for the work you do. It is however hard to grow or relocate within  the company."
good,"The region I worked in had a very high turnover rate and had many branches, mine included, that were running short staffed.  This put both the bank and the employees at risk, and I felt the core reason for the turnover was never addressed."
good,My manger is great! Some are not so much. Promotions are pretty much prepicked for any advancement opening and the salary could be higher. Things should be more fair across the board.
good,"Average employer, not much can be really said about the front line. It's easy to hit sales goals if you are in an affluent area, but still doable in a low income area. Management was not great, but varies from branch to branch. Red tape was a little bit much with very little reasoning behind it."
good,Nothing significant to comment.  Company culture is good and internal security program is robust.  Various lines of businesses have good levels of executive leadership.  Lower level management not as competent.
good,"Initial training was well done and thorough.  You spent time training at job start then would weave work/training together as you start the first few months.  The UBC position was just rolling out at the time, so there was a big push to get many employees (new/old) up to speed on being a teller/platform associate.  Once on goal, you had to make a sales minimum to get paid your bonus.  Some were fortunate to work in busier branches than others.  They implemented a cold calling program about mid-way through my tenure to gain appointments with existing customers.  In this type of setting, you were always trying to involve yourself with customers- so everybody was looking over their shoulder.  Management was good and there was decent pressure to perform, not overwhelming.  Many of the best employees would leave for better positions with other banks.  That was told to me at an early stage, and it came true for me as well.  I was grateful for the training and mentoring I received there.  It definitely helped get my next job."
good,"typical work day was as any other financial institution, teller type environment, opening and/or closing of accounts, loans, customer service, healthy and clean work environment."
good,"At this position i would handle anywhere from 35-55 loan applications, assigned directly to me. I would reach out every few days to try to move the applications forward towards closing. The hardest part of the job was the ever-changing metrics our bonuses and performance was based on, and the lack of communication from management. However, the most enjoyable part was the hours and the environment. It was a very relaxed, friendly, fun environment that let you work at your own pace. Direct managers were great, upper management was the issue within our department."
good,"Unlike other banking institutions or just other companies period, PNC Bank really strives to provide their employees with work/life balance.  The company also strives to give its employees the opportunities to achieve their best.  The teams that you are a part of for the most part really work well together and have great collaboration.  People from many diverse backgrounds allows you to grow as a professional and encourages you to think outside of the box."
good,"The pay was better at Midland Loan Services is better than State .  The first half of the  first year was enjoyable but as the months go by, the expectations rise and there is less room for error.  There is some teaching but often the individual is left to figure out issues on their own. The department had a lot of procedures in place but sometimes it was hard to follow and there was some inconsistencies among different senior employees so it made it harder to know what to do in certain instances.  Still, there were trainings and meetings to aid and address the the errors."
good,"I worked inside of a supermarket which was a little unusual for me however, I was able to succeed and show my worth to the company. I would recommend working for PNC to anyone who needs a job living on the bare minimum."
good,Received a ton of useful training that will help me advance in my career throughout my life. The career just won't be at PNC. The pay was light and the structure a mess.
good,Retail banking is a great way to start a career. The industry is changing into a more digital service while business banking remains the same. I suggest learning business banking to grow into banking in general.
good,"As a branch manager, the sales pressure is very high. Mandatory conference calls up to 4 times a day to ensure one meets sales goals. You are expected to pass the pressure on to the team members. A second scandal is about to happen."
good,It was a nice place to work for after they bought out National City. Good work/life balance. Learned a lot of new things during my time there. Many different departments to choose from.
good,"Hired as a banker, but was never given the opportunity to be a banker.  If you are hired as a branch sales and service associate/ universal banker prepare yourself to spend 95% of your time on the teller line making only your base wage"
good,"I started as a PT teller and quickly advanced to Customer Service,.  I worked at several different branches and went through 5 mergers.  I retired from PNC when I was informed I would have my pay frozen and  given more responsibilities.   Overall I enjoyed at the most part working at PNC."
good,Is a good place to work. The chance for advancement is great if you are willing to work hard.  Great benefit which is hard to find these days.  Hardest part of the job is doing straight data entry for 8 to 9 hours a day.
good,"Major issues surrounding operations and systems, need to invest into technology to help reduce long processes and human error. Too many redundancies and lack of vertical alignment in compliance."
good,"-Good work life balance, not expected to work on weekends or vacations"
good,"Horrible experience with management...new staff now though. Made many, many friends at this company. I would work here again and recommend knowing staff has changed."
good,"I did not see a likeliness to advance out of the call center, which was my goal, I was told in six month I could apply for jobs outside the call center and when I got to that point I was told it’s actually one year and there are many people who had been their longer than me also applying to get out of the call center. I found this very disappointing.  I found the micro management of statistics to be very  emotionally exhausting even though I had five years of customer service experience before working at this job."
good,"A typical workday at PNC was sitting in a cubicle for most of the day.  A 15 minute daily team huddle was completed each day."
good,"Working in the corporate office for the Spanish language team was definitely a great time.  Great people and work environment.  Enjoyed my time there.  Could definitely do with a higher starting wage, but a great job for someone who doesn't want to be a teller but still wants to have the ability to grow within a financial company."
good,"a typical day is a busy day at PNC, your schedule should be full from start to finish. A lot of sales to be had which you get paid on quarterly. Friendly work environment, room for growth"
good,"work was boring, training was minimal, boring atmosphere, good co workers, good hours, pto was nice, nothing exciting, benefits were good, little advancement"
good,"the training is poor"
good,"cash handling accurately process costumer cash, check, transfer and statement transactions, with a balanced or reconciled drawer."
good,PNC was a pleasant place to work. A god team environment with strong team managers for leadership. When my position was terminated the company was very supportive in helping me find a new job.
good,Fast paced environment. It is not for the faint-hearted. Will challenge your customer services skills and your response to resolved upsetting situations.
good,Great Management and really enjoyed working with our customers and members face to face on a daily basis. The team engagement is great and able to meet a lot of people
good,Being responsible for others money can be stressful in itself but as long as your precise in your job task the job is fairly easy. The pay could be better.
good,"A teller is a very mechanical type of work, but the fun part is the opportunity to know people, help them, talk to them and know their stories. It's a very peaceful place, no rush or anything, the manager hardly talk to you. The compensation it's not good."
good,it was fun working here. it was fun working there. i had fun working there. i would like everyone to work there. i want to work back here so bad. I found out i was pregnant
good,Decent place to work. Salary lower than other comparable jobs in the area.  Good benefits.  Emphasis on work/life balance.  Culture is more about sales and less about customer satisfaction
good,working in a bank can be fast or slow paced or both all in one day i enjoyed meeting all types of different people and learning about wire transfers and different laws dealing with cash handling
good,"PNC offers great incentives when you reach your goal, and offers strategies on how to achieve these goals. They offer great benefits and allow you to work from home."
good,"PNC is more interested in their efficiency ratio than in retaining their employees.  There are no inflationary raises and barely every merit raises.  You will be looking at less than inflation, unless you are in a selling role."
good,"PNC strives to meet the work/life balance of their employees.  They achieve this by offering a flexible work schedule, work from home opportunity, and a generous time away package (vacation, personal, occasional absence days)"
good,"It's very functional and high pace. Good hours, great benefits. Employees are very easy to get along with & great management. The training is great and help you prepare for the job itself."
good,"My experience at PNC has been an interesting one. I started as a teller then advance to sales and service rep with a few months so I was fortunate for that opportunity. I typical day at work consists of me running around from platform to teller side all day even though I was told before hire and during training that there would be designated days when I would work each side so it wouldn't become overwhelming. Other than your 2 weeks vacation (and you have to take one full consecutive week) and 10 paid holidays you really have no work life balance. I know that sounds a lot but think about it, if the day you have off is a holiday what can you really get done that day? My coworkers are great though. Never had a problem with any of them despite the high turnover at my branch. I truly stay because I love my clients. Most of them are so nice and make my day."
good,"They are making strides toward becoming more competitive and appealing not just for customers, but for current and potential employees. At the current time, I recommend for someone in college to get sales and consumer relations experience only. The ideal job for college students who need sales and consumer relations experiences ."
good,"being the best I can be at my job, make sure all duties are preformed at highest standard, customers are happy with service and problems are resolved."
good,A very fun place to work. Superb Work-Life Balance. Call Center environment. Have the opportunity to meet other co-workers but demands of job offers little socializing.
good,"A typical day on the job consists of checking and answering emails, resolving any issues that your clients may have (such as an account that has been overdrawn), answering phone calls, making outbound calls to schedule appointments, handle financial transactions and open bank accounts. Lastly lots of coffee. "
good,"The company is very sales driven. Management can be tough. Good benefits, good bonuses, base pay is low but bonuses will make for that"
good,"A typical day would consist of ""morning huddles"" that would consists of everyone's daily goals and additional comments on how we would achieve our individual goals. The branch needs to meet a certain quota every day in order to maintain success - which was difficult depending on your tea. Management was always very helpful and willing to assist their employees whenever needed. Depends on which branch you are work for the employees are hit or miss, but for the most part they're enjoyable and somewhat helpful. "
good,"Worked closely with the business consultant, learned pivot tabels, v look up, managed complex calendars, approve expense reports, check requests, purchase orders"
good,Good company to work for. There is good branch level management support. Stress on hitting numbers but for the most part goal's are achievable. Good team environment. strong customer service focus. Easy to get answers to questions or issues you might not know how to solve.
good,"uplifting work place with associates, sometimes work could be overly  intense. Over all great leadership ideas, great medical benefits an 401k."
good,This role introduced me to the relocation business and allowed me to start interacting with many different Fortune 500 clients.
good,Not much opportunity to advance with a company who promotes from the outside but I love being a banker. the customers are the greatest.
good,Great bank to work for but management can be chalenging. They do not pla ce the right people in the management role; people who have been financial services producers in the past. The bank does a very good job of recognizing acheivments.
good,"Good Team "
good,Great work life balance and low pay. Too much work and not enough pay. Too much documenting and not enough time to bring money into the bank.
good,Good work environment but a little disorganized.  Not much job security due to the growing and falling mortgage market.  Would work there again if given the opportunity.
good,"Open branch, perform night drop bags before opening, servicing customers needs(deposits,check cashing, payments etc) Lobby engagement with customers. Engage in conversation to help customers get every service that we offer . Balancing at end of day. Performing various closing duties,"
good,Back issues which kept me from efficiently performing excel level.
good,"Most of the challenge in moving forward or making changes is that the wheels move at a snail's pace, and communication between teams can be non-existent. On the other hand, the people are great, PNC understands its employees have a life outside of work, and there is a lot of flexibility."
good,Its a great company...  limited product line though...   Management was great...   It was hard to compete with other banks with a bigger product line though..
good,"Assist customers with deposits, withdrawals, and payments. Answer telephone assist customers with problems or questions concerning accounts."
good,There are numerous awards foe outstanding performance. Successful employees are rewarded.
good,"Day to day operational functions,apply features & benefits of financial products & services in customer interactions. Service clients needs and customer service. Learned how to offer products suitable for clients that fit client needs. Staff always worked as a team. Most enjoyable part of job was building customer relations."
good,"Diposit checks, cash checks, withdrawal money from diferent accounts, referrals, cashiers checks, money orders. Work with money all day."
good,"A very relaxing atmosphere to work with. Everybody gets along with each other, people are ready to work and teach you whatever you don't know. Hardest part is EOM you cannot leave till all project are taken care off"
good,Difficult place to work at the time due to management that managed by fear and intimidation.
good,"PNC is a good place to work. However, management backing and capital allocation to support internal services severely lags, primarily in technology. "
good,"I love working with my co-workers, unfortunately our branch is being closed. Advancement into higher pay grades is difficult even if you have the education qualifications. Branch workers have low pay. I have met a lot of great people-customers and co-workers. "
good,"decent company with room for advancement, although there is frequent turnover on the retail side."
good,Some customers are friendly and transactions are easy.Sometimes alot of emphasis is put on the sales.
good,"I typically come in after the branch has opened, and work til closing time. I run a cash drawer daily, and provide customer service. The most frustrating part of the job is that I am only part time, and there is no full time position available. I love the people I work with."
good,Strictly collections of charged off checking accounts. Changing of rules for the use of the cell phone #'s to be called. New compliance of law for contacts availability.
good,"Although I really like PNC Bank and it's values, I felt there was a lack of communication and understanding within our specific branch which in return may have caused a lack of a team oriented workplace at times."
good,"Good people to work with, make you feel a part of the team immediately. Work/Life Flexibility is great, managers willing to work with you when situations arise. Appreciate that promoting within is a huge priority."
good,I have learned that without working together we can not satisfy a clients request. We teach each other new things that we learn everyday. Work with clients to make sure that they have the best services to fit their comapnies needs. Work with collegues in the field to assist with documentation and satsifying the client. I enjoy working with the clients and building that bond with them thaty I can get it done for them and make their work life easier.
good,PNC Bank was a good job for me that taught me the skills of cash management. I worked with a lot of great employees that really taught me a lot. I enjoyed working with the business customers I served they were like family. They always told me their joys and sorrows and showed great respect.
good,A typical day at pnc consist of finding financial solutions for our clients. I've learned what cues and clues to look for when engaging in conversations with clients so I can direct them to the right associate. I have great relationships with my coworkers and management. Not being able to accommodate all a clients needs is one of the hardest parts of the job. The most enjoyable part of working for pnc is getting to know our customers
good,"Overall the job is good. The pay is excellent for part-time. This job relies heavily on everyone doing their part because team work is the heart of the bank. The job is the same every day. You do the exact thing over and over, with very little variety. There are chances to be promoted and it's encouraged to seek out those opportunities. The downside is the heavy reliance on teamwork. In order to do your job the very best everyone else must do their jobs their very best. If someone isn't there or isn't performing as a team member you all suffer. Even with the monthly performance reviews it's difficult to understand what the expectations are and how you are measuring up. Sometimes it seems like the rules change from day to day. While working here I have learned a lot about personal responsibility and ownership of my job. I have also learned to just let things 'roll off.' This job is simple enough, but has a lot of procedure and rules. You have to be patient with yourself as you learn all the rules, regulations and procedures. The most enjoyable part of this job is getting off around 6 most days and not working Sundays. Overall this is a good job."
good,Easy to learn but management makes it difficult to advance.
good,Assisted customers with day to day transactions
good,"A typical day at work would consist of prospecting business customers, by way of computer generated leads, cold calls, and onsites. I have learned many new aspects of business life cycle mgt, business lending (underwriting) and cross sell techniques. Management performance is different from region to region, depends on were you are."
good,"Compensation not competitive over the long tenure. You must move either inside or outside the company to get a good increase in pay, regardless of performance."
good,I have been a teller for over 8 years and I want to use all I have learned from the teller/ banker positions
good,"I work predominately for the high new worth reporting group. I support four regions, over 30 Investment Professions and over 7000 accounts. I manage the relationship with our reporting vendor to insure that our performance reports will deliver an accurate sophisticated picture of the client’s portfolio. Not only do I enhance the reports currently in production, but I work with Investment Advisors to create new reports that would benefit the client. Most Recently I have created a Private Equity report which captures the Investment Rate of Return for these assets."
good,no advancement in this company. Good work life balance. Great benefits and 401K
good,"PNC is a great place to start a career but you may have to leave and come back to get paid fairly.  While they like to promote from within, it's more to save on paying market value for the job then waiting to put the right person in the right position."
good,"Very stressful, but has good advancement opportunities and the managers are truly their to help in that advancement.  Have great benefits and have great training to prepare you for the job you are training for"
good,"The compensation is lower compared to other companies, especially if you’re being promoted within the company.  Lots of times people get promotions without any pay increase."
good,"Great culture, decent work life balance, but overall pay compared to the job requirements is very low. Difference in pay for others varies very drastically."
good,Not the best job in the world ( i work in the collections department) but benefits are great and pay is good. Paid sick days (6 a year) and vacation (15 days plus one personally day.. which is basically the same thing). Managers are hit or miss however I've worked under three in the department and all have been wonderful and supportive.. the higher up the later of management the less they care about the little guy. If you do your job well and put in your time you can move to other departments that are less stress and better pay. All in all a great place to start in a corporate environment.
good,"I learned I am not a salesperson. This is a very competitive sales role and PNC expects you to wring referrals and account/investment openings from nowhere. Sell, sell, sell. Well I am more for protecting my customers' well-being so I tried to give them good advice, not upsell them at every turn. Therefore I could not get transferred/promoted and got the minimal raise at the start of the year."
good,No room for growth at all. This job is good for someone that is young and still lives with their parents. While there it was fine. I needed more. Management seems to not wont you to better yourself
good,"Great atmosphere to work.  The department was a fun place.  It was busy/stressful at times but it didn't get too overwhelming.  If you like variety, you'll like it here."
good,Between the customers and upper management makes the job somewhat difficult highly stressful environment have seen colleagues literally in tears due to the demand of job.
good,PNC Bank is always ahead of the curve when it comes to tech savvy  products and services. Very competitive benefits package which includes 401k matching and one of the loan remaining companies which offers a pension plan.
good,PNC Bank's shareholders make millions of dollars every quarter but the employees don't even get a living wage.  I had to work 2 jobs just to survive.  There was no room for advancement.
good,Great Company to work for if it is your first job... Very nice environment to work if you are under 30 and live with your parents... It is a family environment that look at cares about each other..
good,"Working here is a good experience in terms of the challenge of the work and the team you work with.  However PNC itself is lacking in reasons to keep you as an employee. Their benefits offered are very weak, the salary is nothing special, and overall the competitive landscape puts PNC toward the bottom of major financial institutions,"
good,"This bank was located in a poor area in the city.  Twice while I was there the bank was robbed once with gun and the other a bomb threat.  I enjoyed helping people with their finances as car loans, mortgages, opening savings and checking accounts and assisting our customers with day to day financial needs."
good,PNC provided opportunities for growth and education within the company. They had several events available to employee involvement in their communities. They also allowed for time off to volunteer in your local community.
good,PNC is a great place to work depending on the department you work in. Recently they started to focus more on quantity than quality in certain department which lowered the moral among the team often leaving them stressed.
good,"not very good upper managements, but vey good coworkers, also work our are pretty good to balance you life schedule. but overall a very good company for recent graduates,"
good,The company was bought out but it was a good starting job out of school for those who did not have any work experience. you have to start somewhere so i would say try a bank or a call center every time if you don't know what you want to do.
good,"I learned a lot about finances working here, which also helped in my personal life. They are a huge company with great benefits, they just don't like to pay employees enough."
good,The atmosphere is comfortable. The pay is low. The background process is discriminating and bias. The challenges that they put their candidates through is not worth the pay. It's usually the jobs like that.
good,"PNC is a great company. However, I came from the branches to the call center and the atmosphere was totally different. Advancement can be difficult. B"
good,Inflexible and at times hostile management made work in this highly regulated and high volume environment unnecessarily oppressive.  High turnover of personnel seems related to low starting salaries for overqualified new hires.
good,good place to work and learn from others in the financial world. friendly staff and great manager that I learned to apply skills outside of work. lots of interactions so you get to sharpen your conversation skills
good,Very low pay for the work that you do. Duties and responsibilities change everyday. Too much paperwork. Personnel changed constantly so you always felt short handed.
good,I have been with PNC for 16 years and they have good health benefits and when my children were little a good home work balance. The flexibility for family is great. There is always  something new to learn and the management team is willing to help you move forward into other positions. The most enjoyable part of the job is the flexibility. The hardest part of the job are the audits.
good,"not able to write review....................................................."
good,One of better Banks to work for except the pay could be better. Company does what's best for the customers and doesn't place pressure on employee's.
good,"Great opportunities to work, learn and grow within the banking industry.  Have seen many people on my team promoted to better opportunities within the bank.  company has excellent array of Employee Business groups that allow employees to network and grow within the bank."
good,"My Job as a default specialist at PNC Bank was fast paced and at times, stressful. The people who I worked with were kind and fun to be around. Without them working as a default specialist would been much more stressful."
good,"It was  a good place to work. it was just to slow. because so many competing banks was so close near by. good co-workers, good manager, good overall company."
good,"Multitasking on a day to day basis. Work at a fast pace but with zero errors. Learned how to manage files and records, work with numerous computer screens at once. View a customer financial needs in a way that we can benefit them. The hardest part of the job is making sure the customers are satisfied with wait time considering the bank the short staffed. The most enjoyable part is connecting with the customers on a personal basis."
good,The job is great. Working In-store is much better than working in a traditional branch. My coworkers are amazing. The  hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers.. and sometimes having to meet your goals.
good,Fellow employees are always willing to assist others and maybe the job fun.  I enjoy assisting customer with their banking needs.
good,Everyone always worked as a team. Management always gave an helping hand as needed. It was a pleasure providing excellent customer service.
good,"My day consists of coaching my employees on outbound sales calls as well as during client interactions. This goes on throughout the day. When I am not doing this, I will make outbound business calls to generate business appointments. I make action plans for various goals such as CIQ (customer experience) and EIQ (employee experience). Take care of clients as they come in for their various needs. My coworkers/the team I manage consists of 4 individuals at all different levels. One in more tenured at over 14 years of service down to one that has been with me for only three months. I would not say there is a hardest part of the job, I see challenges as opportunities to learn and grow. The most enjoyable part of the job is the different clients I meet and get to know on a daily basis."
good,Normally a typical work day begins with a team huddle to discuss any changes and focus on making that a better day. The main thing I learned working at PNC is always be flexible and willing to make any necessary adjustments to complete an escalated issue.
good,"A typical day of work at PNC bank consists of constant Bank transactions which progressively and consistently made me better at my job as a teller. It taught me that i can deal with various and or any type of customer with accuracy patience and kindness. The management at the bank was efficient and fair. My co-workers were great, we helped each other and relied on each other on an hourly basis. The hardest part of the job at PNC bank was on paydays. I had to efficiently and quickly handle the customers transactions and relate to them, while keeping the length of the line to a minimum in the drive way and in the bank at the same time, which was also the funnest part of my job.."
good,"-Typical Day consists of opening the branch. "
good,Work with three trading products and all the necessary work for all customers under those products.
good,"It started off as good, good training, when you're on your teams they ride you on everything. Over whelm you first time you mess up they blame you for loosing customers. Has their good & bad days. Coaches & managers has that ""I'm better than you attitude"" Pay is good if you're full time, part time barely gets you by."
good,the opportunity to transfer to another branch is not easily achieved. Annual pay is on the lower scale than most financial institutions.
good,"•	Oversee the daily performance of computer systems."
good,"I worked in PNC Bank's InStore channel for several years.  It is a great entry level experience for anyone looking to start a career in banking. The primary role of an In-Store banker is to prospect for clients inside of Giant Supermarkets with the purpose of recommending various products and services including accounts, investments, and credit instruments. There are very aggressive sales goals which can be stressful at times but the company does provide you with tools to get the job done. The position does require you work long non-conventional bank hours as the branches are open 7 day per week 364 days per year. There are strong advancement opportunities for those that excel in their roles. This probably wouldn't be a good fit for anyone looking for a traditional banking position."
good,"A typical day at work, filing work, making new loans, data entry, destroying old loans."
good,This was a very rewarding job. If you can keep fast pace and stay efficient this is a great opportunity.
good,PNC is a forward thinking financial institution with upward movement in relationship to the various other large banks of the nation.  PNC prides itself with great work/life balance.
good,PNC offers a top level benefit program and provides PM's the opportunity to work from home 2-days per week.  Working at home provides the opportunity to reduce stress from being in the office.
good,Typical day at work consisted of coming in logging into your computer and taking phone calls all day. i learned how to service credit and debit card accounts. i didn't really like management being they fired me over a rumor that wasn't true. hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers. most enjoyable part was working on Sunday being it was really slow on Sunday.
good,"There are no excuses for being short staffed and you are asked to ""do what it takes"" to get your job done. Between employees leave of absences, mandatory vacations, and turnover, I frequently work at night or early morning to just stay a float. It's a repetitive but not constant problem."
good,"the benefits offered, flexibility, and direct supervisors are all great, very nice work environment and location. Very career advancement focused. The downside would be the expectations placed by upper management and the customers themselves. In general people don't call a call center because everything is ok, and the expectation for volume of calls taken and time spent taking calls was absurd."
good,Inbound calls 70-100 calls per day 
good,"PNC is a very conservative and fair company to work for. I very much enjoyed the interactions I had with my other coworkers and the clientele, on most days. My favorite thing was showing people how to use the alternate forms of banking such as the mobile app or the ATM's. My biggest dislike of the job was how much pressure is put on the employees, even the tellers, to push products and services on the clients. We had sales goals to meet and we HAD to be asking the clients about credit cards, lines of credit, account upgrades and more, even if we see this client multiple times a week."
good,"A comunicative boss, competent co workers who knew their jobs and would go out of their way to help, in mature business that PNC eventually exited. It was the best of times/"
good,"I worked in a call center in Pittsburgh. "
good,"Alot of resposibility, Little training, low pay."
good,I learned many good skills at PNC and the banking industry.  The benefits are great. PNC has taught me more financial responsibility personally and allowed me to advise others on the skills I learned.
good,Productive and fast paced environment. I was active lead teller for 6months.Very nice coworkers but poor management and always short staff. Enjoy working with people.
good,It was a Good internship experience. The work life balance was great and the people were very understanding of any issues you had. The pay for the internship was also very good
good,Work/Life balance is fantastic. Lots of activities to show employee appreciation. Enjoyed working with the people in my group. Always willing to assist when needed.
good,My daily tasks were to monitor the vault money and verify we have enough to get us through the week and make sure we never had too much on hand. I would assist customers with their everyday banking needs and transactions.
good,"Its a good job for a new entry into the workplace, but the compensation does not align itself with present economy. the workplace culture involves complete unity within the branch which includes branch manager, tellers, personal bankers, wealth management bankers, and mortgage loan officers."
good,Opportunity for advancement is available. Nice place to work. Pretty good benefits. Flexible place to work at. ***************************************
good,Great place to start a career. There are a lot of opportunities and for the most part you only have to be in one position for 6 months before applying to others. Some of the departments are open 24 hours so you can find a shift that will work for you. Compensation is offered in most positions and they will accommodate all disabilities.
good,"Each time new management came in, they were going to fix what was wrong with PNC. Management never took the advice of the employees that were there before them."
good,Working as a personal banker and Accountant assistant with 5 years of experience learnt a lot new accounting techniques and dealt with lots of new faces in challenging work environment.
good,Overall nice but not enough pay for me with all the stress on sales goals and tracking sales. Management and staff are nice and very professional and willing to help you advance but you have to want a career selling.
good,"This Job was very stressful as it required you to be on the phone all day. We used an automatic dialing system, so the calls never stopped, and most of the conversations were argumentative.  This job was a collections job, so you were calling customers to pay their debts to the bank."
good,There's consistent issues with staffing and a disconnect between corporate and retail but hopefully they're working on it. Great benefits.
good,"Worked in the operations side of the bank and found a lot of long-tenured and heavily entrenched people. Some of whom were great people. "
good,This job is a lot of customer service. Its usually a very busy day. The co-workers are very nice and management is very helpful. The hardest part of the job is the miserable customers. The most enjoyable part is your day goes by fast.
good,They say they're a family oriented company but during hard family times they don't show compassion to situations such as death. This is a very fast paced job and they are very short staffed. Someone is constantly getting fired and they have no problem replacing you.
good,"Hours are great"
good,"Advise clients of best financial practices"
good,Co worker are nice but the management no so much. The work load the majority of the time was heavy. The compensation and benefits are good.
good,"Great learning experience. Quick time frames, fast paced and full of technical challenges."
good,"I think that PNC-Investments is fine overall and will be a great place to be in several years, but unfortunately at the moment it is still a bank in transition due to RBC being acquired by PNC. I enjoy my job and meeting with clients but the reality is that the bank only has 2 percent of the regional market share and to further complicate things RBC didn't have a sales culture and there have been significant hurdles trying to implement one."
good,"After the merger between PNC, and National City, PNC tended to adopt most of National Cities practices. I am not sure why a huge successful bank would buy a failing bank and then adopt their practices."
good,"PNC Bank is a great large Bank, I've learned a lot of skills, coaching, leadership, loans, communicating with all different kinds of people. Management does not always see the employee's side who are doing the day in and day out work."
good,"A day at work would always start with a Quick Start. Quick Start is a 10-15 minute pep rally. I would huddle with the team to set individual goals on activities for the day and set the stage. Motivate the team to reach their goals and set the tone of the day. "
good,"It was queit interesting. The managers had favorites that could do no wrong, but as a whole its a goo company to work for."
good,"Great place to work, however, it is a giant tree of micromanagement."
good,"PNC Bank in my opinion is a good starting ground. Advancing in lower positions is very achievable, but advancing to upper management is impossible... The pay is okay, not the highest, but still better than most. Incentive plan is mediocre, unless in a very high traffic/ high net worth area. Benefits like healthcare and vacation are very good. Work culture is inviting, but certain policies in place allow for employees to slack and really not get punished (my own branch experiences)."
good,The instution had really great people. management is what kept me for the time I was there. great team work. the pay was too little. I would not go back unless they increased the pay
good,PNC is a great company to get a foot in the door with the financial industry with vast opportunity for advancement.  Unfortunately they do no pay their employees appropriately compared to national averages.
good,"great company for consumers, very technology advanced."
good,"PNC seems to go through frequent changes, but because of good management, and an overall good team, working for PNC was great. PNC seems to be a little dated compared to other banks, and I believe it were a bit more advanced, the company and the employees will benefit greatly."
good,"I have learned a lot about the teller line"
good,"Great people, management is always helpful but compensation could be a little higher. "
good,"Working at PNC is very laid back, the only thing is the salary is not enough. I get my work done in a timely manner and my peers are awwesome.Clients are friendly and everyone is very respectful."
good,"Great work environment but the pay is not great. It is hard to get a raise because it depends on your customer surveys and your sells goal, but they say you have no goals to meet. Internal promotion pay is not good."
good,good place to work at the training part is very exciting !!!they send you to a hotel and give you a free stay ! great transition
good,"Management is great"
good,"This is a great bank to work for. I work in the grocery store branch. The hours are extended and we do work holidays. The company offers good healthcare, but very high deductibles. Maternity leave is 16 weeks here. the bank unlike many other companies matches the 401k 4% and has a pension unlike other banks. Yes other banks do pay more that is the only issue. We aren't pressured as hard as other banks to sell sell sell but it worth it if you want the money."
good,Company is ok to work for. The location I worked for was very slow but we still had to have the same amount of referrals as the busy locations. PNC is one of the lowest paying banks in the area. I could have easily went to another big bank and made extra $2 an hour. They have pretty good benefits however and some pretty good incentives.
good,Just keying and learning job functions. This is a great company to work for. The money should be a little better though. That's all I have to say about it
good,Good place to work. Great people and a good balance for life. Sometimes things can get hectic. You have to really be able to roll with the punches.
good,"Although it's not one of the safest places to work, PNC can be a good place to work. I believe the pay for tellers could improve and they should also invest in security."
good,"My head teller was very nice, If you had any questions she was very helpful in assisting you, Got to know people who were regular customers and establish a relationship with them. Most people who came the the bank were very nice. All my co-workers were nice.The end of the day was kind of stressful when it came time to count your drawer and make sure it balanced."
good,"PNC is a great place to work. The company has excellent ethics, great training."
good,same if your boss has an issue with you you dont get paid senior and to get bonus you depend on the customers if they like you or not and if they are in a good mood
good,I worked in a Branch inside Giants. The only thing I disliked about working for PNC was the compensation. I think we deserved higher pay annually. They do not push goals so hard but you still have to meet your goals. My manager was awesome! Working in the branch you had to go into the aisles and talk to customers who were really focused on getting their groceries. It is a lot of standing and walking the grocery store. I also hate that you have to wear uniform while the traditional banks do not have to. PNC has the best training facilities however. Not much for promotion.
good,"Wonderful company to work for, however there is a trade for the perks and that's the pay. Perks are good especially holidays and health, pay is low. It's banking so you get days off another career wouldn't normally offer. Lots and lots of time off, 3 weeks vacation, 1 personal day, 5 sick days; if you are on written warning or the sort for absences, the fault is all yours. The supervisors are great they'll move you up if you're good! I've worked at worse places when it comes to perks, but the pay was way higher. Company matches 5% 401k, healthcare costs are low and I have a family.  All depends on what you're looking for. Pay vs perks definitely though. I settled for peace of mind, at least until I can have both."
good,I have had the opportunity to learn about the post default and property preservation; the hardest part of the job is the increase work and less help
good,Until this point I've never worked in a call center!!!!! Its definitely a lot of information to cover but once you get a handle on how things work its a piece of cake. you get incentive for quality calls and schedule adherence and paid holidays :-) However my current schedule just isn't conducive to my family life
good,"Worked at PNC for 2 years, great place with plenty of upward mobility and opportunity. few issues with payroll once or twice aside great company that offers flexible options"
good,"Good manager team, life and work balance. Everyone will help you achieve your goals and will help you grow withing the bank. if you work hard you will make it far in the company"
good,i made great relationships and still have them today.  I learned  a lot about credit analysis and during my time I was their longer with the National City leadership.
good,"Fast paced, large sales goals, fun environment, opportunity to advance, enjoyable co-workers, nice benefits, competitive salary."
good,Great work culture but pays employees extremely low wages.
good,"The best part of the job was my Team Lead she was amazing. The employees were decent. I learned basic banking skills such as helping customers with their banking needs and wants helping them with re-ordering a debt card or a stolen card, making sure when they went on vacation they would have a note in the account letting the next person that worked on that account if any fraudulent activity happened they would know if or not the customer was out of the country or not. Loans, interest rates etc. The experience with PNC wasnt as i was hoping but it has made me understand banking a lot more than i did before i worked there."
good,There was alot of stress working for this employer because we were understaffed.
good,"My role as a teller was great because I was able to help many households with their financial well-being but the pay for my job was not consistent with the quality of work I was putting into it. Although we got quarterly bonuses, my hourly pay was significantly less than other tellers from other companies. PNC just recently changed their pay rate and is now starting new hires with no experience more than what I was making when I left after almost 5 years of service. I also crossed trained as a customer service associate. "
good,It depends on where you work but in retail banking it was the worst when they changed regaional management. I would really think about if you like long hours and being over worked
good,I had a blast working with office I was at. We treated each other like family. No one was bossy when the Manager was out of the office. We knew what was expected of us and we got the job done.
good,PNC is honestly a decent company to work for if you have the right team. I enjoy working with customers and helping them with their needs. I also enjoy building relationships with them. I don't like the pushy sales atmosphere. The minimum requirements for sales is absolutely absurd.
good,"Enhanced my skills of handling  diverse people. Very interesting place to work. My co workers are very nice. Even though I like working here, there is not many opportunities for advancement in the area of my study."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them. Business wasn't very busy except the day before a major holiday.
good,Good Company besides the pay is horrible. Their is little room for advancement
good,"PNC is a Great Company to work for, but the upper management with the Atlanta base lockbox leaves the site open to untrustworthy managers. You then lose good employees and bad moral becomes an everyday reminder. Your team feels this is just a job and are afraid to speak up."
good,"Honestly this was a Good experience,  I worked from home and was able to help thousands of people.  This added to life perspectives.  Unfortunately team leads and management will not actually be there for you. They will give you advice but not solid advice, if you do make a mistake.  It will take them a very long time to help you and you could possibly get fired for simple mistakes. Training is very vague..... you will learn everything you need to know once pnc throws you into the game."
good,great opportunities follow you. the system is made in a way to appreciate and recognize every move . there is a fare amount of trainings for different topics that could help in getting better results.
good,"Banking is good at PNC and working is okay.  It's low paying and very dumbed down, but it's a good place to get your foot in the door if you plan to work elsewhere in banking."
good,"Responsibilities:"
good,"National City was better"
good,I’m currently employed at PNC and overall enjoy my job! My only complaint is the way the proceedures and training is handled . Like most I would like to see the income be more inline with other banks and credit unions.
good,"Micro managed to the T. Score cards for everything. No real human contact, everything is done on the computer. Oftentimes, poor direction as if the management team doesnt know or care. It was excellent experience and I got to work with many fun and enjoyable people over the years. There were times when I couldnt wait to go to work the next day"
good,"typical banking environment, fast paced at times, highly regulated requires high level of attention, cross selling required, corporate casual to corporate culture"
good,Employees are kind and care for one another. Many departments feel like family. I learned a lot during my years of work with Pnc. I would recommend this as an employee.
good,You can advance at pnc if you can tolerate the low pay for awhile. They’re maternity leave policy is horrible. It’s stressful work for the little pay you receive. You’re constantly watched and not in a good way.
good,"Pay scales were changed in 2017 for branch employees to be more competitive with other banks. Pressure sales atmosphere still very present even after Wells Fargo fiasco. No longer based on ""numbers"" (even though we still have goals) but ""behaviors"" (whatever that means.)"
good,I love my position within PNC but I'm keeping my options open to career advancement and better opportunities. I just want to see what is available to me.
good,Built a portfolio of nonprofit organizations with foundations and investment management accounts for financial management within one of the country's more respected banking institutions was rewarding.
good,I enjoyed working for this part of PNC as i worked with loan officers within the company.  I also helped the reverse mortgage team as well with many aspects.  I was disappointed when the company was sold as there wasn't a position for me to take.
good,"Okay company to work for. The branch I'm located at is typically busy. There is some unfair treatment and I do not receive benefits as I am still a part time employee, however that changes after a year of employment. The atmosphere at my branch is fun and energetic. I love the people I work with, however, management could step it up."
good,the banking industry has changed from service to retail. I believe we lost the value of customer service by making the bank a retail store. without talking bad about the company or PNC  I rather keep my comments to my self.
good,"You are able to advance or train for other positions. Most of my 13 years there, I enjoyed working for PNC, got along with everyone, and  performed my job well.  The last few years, however, was a different story.  Due to extremely difficult guidelines set by people that never performed the actual job position, most employees had great difficulty meeting performance standards, and were penalized including going without normal annual raises.  I moved to another state but still hear about that department; they still have an ongoing problem with high turnover - and I surely know why."
good,"Great culture, co-workers were very accomplished and talented.  "
good,"Been here about 10 years, and I have never been promoted in the department I worked in. The only time I have moved up in grade is when I left the department. I now have 2 degrees (one in a Business field) and am becomingly more frustrated with the opportunities that I have been seeing. I wish there was a development program for internal employees."
good,PNC acquired RBC (Royal Bank of Canada) after only one year of working for them. Never had a problem with RBC but i think PNC could it done a better job with the transition.
good,The work environment was a wonderful place to be. Being a part time teller though you get stuck working every Saturday because you are only part time and they feel that you do not deserve to have Saturdays off they only go to the full time employees.
good,"A typical day was assisting customers, while trying to meet sales goals. Although there is a lot of talk about advancement and growth, it is pretty difficult to move from the retail side, if you find that sales is not your niche. I witnessed this with several of my co workers. The hardest part was adjusting to playing the role of a personal banker, while still being a teller, and not being compensated for the extra work, training, etc. PNC pays well if you meet sales goals, in their incentive pay...if you are not a teller. They pay $6 for each DDA acct (checking/savings) for tellers, but, pay bankers and teller supervisors more. There is no job security in the retail side of banking, as everything is heading to the technology side. Branches will be scarce."
good,a very busy branch with a lot of money going in and out. Had great co-workers and regular customers. I learned laws about money and government reporting. Stressful environment.
good,"Change Management PM assignment was an interesting project assignment that increased my collaboration skills with other PMs, Developers, BA's/QA/Production Team to easily move changes for a large project through the system."
good,"▪ Extracts remittances based on standard operating procedures. Responsible for maintaining specific productivity and quality levels. May require some operation and basic ten key skills."
good,I had a great experience working at PNC. It led me to my current job and was a great place to develop some professional skills and also meet some great people!
good,There is potential for a wonderful career for the right person.  You must enjoy a highly regulated industry with strict policies and procedures.  Management is set in their ways leaving very little room for improvement on processes.  Co-workers and benefits are the best part of the job.
good,PNC offers a productive work environment with plenty of opportunity for advancement. There are constantly jobs being posted in other department of the bank looking to recruit from within the company.
good,"We were open inside supermarkets. So the bank was open 364 days a year. the hardest part of the job was the hours. Customer interaction was great. Activities with customers such as trivia contests, birthdays, give away days"
good,"Work days consist of answering phone calls, managing money and safe. As well as satisfying customers needs and engaging with every customer who walks into pnc."
good,there was good days and bad days.. the bad out weighed the good. In hard and challenging times the company was non supportive and understanding of timely demanding issues but expect for team members to be understanding. The work required did not match the time it took to complete certain tasks as well as the compensation.
good,"Job was eliminated - whatever. But the company was okay. They micromanage everything in the branches which is okay for some but others may find difficulty with the servere lack of autonomy. Company does care about customers and growth but I'm not sure about it's lower level employers. Pay isn't great, hours aren't great, lunch isn't paid, branch stay open late and somehow I almost always ended up closing and getting home at 7pm (banker hours apparently). My branch never accepted snow emergencies as reason to be late despite multiple roads being closed and whitnessing a car slide off the road in front of me - literally call 911 and directed them to the car which went down a hill but still got yelled at."
good,"PNC has been a great place to work for the past 5 years. There have been many changes over the years which has resulted in more meetings, more processes and more stuff that takes us away from our clients.  PNC use to treat us like adults and now it is going towards constant monitoring and oversight."
good,"Customer Service - meeting customer needs. "
good,"Great Company to work for if you are committed to your work. Sometimes there are managers who are not necessarily the best breed out there and will make you quit your position - like any corporate; tons of bureaucracy and pay structures changes way too much,"
good,"A nice place to work, great colleagues. The interview process was short and was offered the job within a week. PNC is also customer friendly, making sure that its products are matched to its customers financial needs."
good,"working for PNC was ok. I enjoyed only working 8-5 everyday. However, my branch was always short staffed so I worked every Saturday. Being the teller supervisor wasn't worth it because I only made $2.80 more thazn my regular tellers. so the moral of the store is if you want to work for pnc just be a regular teller!"
good,"Truly enjoy working for PNC but I feel that as much as I have done for the company, I need more compensation and I am maxed out where I am at.  The opportunity for advancement is very slim.  I'm ready for change."
good,A good place to work - can be very stressful depending on management styles and preferences.  Some long time stars on staff were a joy to work with on projects.
good,Love the hours monday through friday 8 to 5 with paid holidays and occasional weekends that you would work. You do get sick days as well and personal days.
good,The people that work for the mortgage company are very good.  Positions in management have poor work/life balance as there is no away from the office.  Technology is not very good so have to compensate with more time to fix systems
good,PNC is a great place to work. The job is simple and fast paced. They are very strict with monthly referrals and if they are not met you are required to stay after work to complete.
good,"Review performance metrics to determine if adjustments need made for the current day's work performance."
good,I have been here for 2 years and I have had the opportunity to move up. It is a great employer however there are areas that need improvement. Management on the retail can be difficult and moving up can be challenging.
good,This job is pretty straight forward. You are taking calls most of the day & the job requires for you to be on the phones and at your desk at all times.
good,"opening the branch in the morning, setting up you cash drawers getting out any mail that needs to distributed to the Branch. Most importantly following all rules and procedures to ensure the safety of the customer an the branch"
good,"PNC taught me a lot. i learned patients working in a call center for over a year and a half. "
good,"My position is quite laid back and intense. However, there is no room for development and lack of management. I learned that in order to move ahead I need to leave."
good,"Great Co -Workers, Fast paced working environment. Customer's are "
good,Compensation is below industry standards in some areas.  Good benefits.  Room for advancement but frequent restructures with layoffs.
good,"You know that feeling when the alarm clocks goes off and your like, ups!, gotta go to work. Well this work life was like refreshing every morning, willing and ready to get work started. Everyone comes to work with positive attitudes and we get straight to learning what's new, what goals are set for the day and what products do we sale today. Management was on point, we all had a share in lobby management. The hardest part about the job when you really mediate on it, would be trying to dislike my job, lol no but, to work around those who doesn't take their job seriously. The best part about my job was to learn new things everyday or every second of the day, to actually help those who need help, I loved building relationships with my customers as well as co-workers, just learning new things everyday was an enjoyment."
good,"I work with a lot of great people.  There really is no typical day, each day is different.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that in working with such great people, we can all learn from each other different aspects of our job."
good,"Pay was decent, don't expect to advance in company though.  Health benefits very expensive."
good,"Follow the leader whether or not you follow his point of view. If you are looking to be an individual, look elsewhere. This company wants you to fit into a very square hole; even if you are an exceptional circle."
good,"Disappointed in PNC by the Management they hire. They usually are experienced.  "
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my employment at PNC. The culture is great, but there are a few individuals to take advantage of their power by making employees feel inferior to them."
good,"There was always work. The only real complaint I have is Senior management, and procedures. Things were not documented well. They have an extreme termination policy. If you mess up one time there was no written warning you are done. They have a very high turn over rate."
good,"Good hours, learned about auditing, management was quite good, some tense times with one person, dealing with person daily was hard, people were nice."
good,My time at PNC has been unforgettable.  I'm thankful for having been provided the opportunity to provide quality service to such an enthusiastic company.
good,"Culture is lacking and the pay is not desirable nor are the raises. "
good,"We had a meeting in the am to discuses work for the day, Once the day got started the management had a few meetings and offered little help...……………….."
good,"Seems to be all about Investments, even when your not licensed. All staff members talking about investments. Call nights specific to Investments. There is Business Banking , consumer banking, lending, but only call night for Investments."
good,Company is really good. management is terrible. It was a great company to work for besides that. It was a good experience overall. I like there workplace banking department the best
good,Good Bank to work for. Partners are all professional. Most difficult obstacle is the sheer fact that it is banking which is highly regulated.. Good benefits and culture.
good,"I learned a lot about the mortgage business and all the different forms associated with Mortgages. took all classes that was required, met my goals as required."
good,"I noticed that no one rarely stays long at the PNC call center. Out of 19 employees in my training class in June 2017, only 2 people remain. The employees in the Columbus call center will all be working from home by the end of 2018."
good,"I enjoyed working at PNC.  Fast pace very busy, Time goes by face during peak time. Hard to move around in company. Learned a lot everyday something new."
good,they are always changing the rules & making exceptions. Management is good but tends to do everything leaving the rest of the team with barely any customers to make goals.
good,"*  The banking industry has changed so much over the past 20 years."
good,"The company itself is great. I do not have a negative thing to say about the comapny, or my original managment team. My department was split up and I was one of the unfortunate ones to get a green horn manager. There was little to no direction given to her, she made it next to impossible to do our jobs, she got rid of a lot of people to bring passed employees from her old place of employment in, she cause 4 long term employees to either quit or get fired. bottom line.... We as employees were not protected from the new managment style and were told to shape to her standard (which was very low) or ship out."
good,"Providing account services to customers by receiving deposits and loan payments, cashing checks, issuing savings withdrawals, recording night deposits, selling cashiers check/money orders, answering questions related to financial well being and other bank services."
good,"The job entailed recruiting, coaching and managing licensed specialists housed in bank branches across 4 region territory. Focus was on individual investment sales under $100k and referrals to PNC investments and PNC wealth management for larger transactions from branch customer base.  Heavy telemarketing work to obtain client appointments. FS were sales leaders in branch and coached team to secure referrals. Employees also had to meet retail branch goals for opening new accounts and obtaining loans and credit card accounts."
good,Challenging position with stringent deadlines due on a daily basis.  Overtime required and new assignments were given without the luxury of being properly trained.
good,There's ok room for advancement even though they make you feel like there is. The company is really uptight and they say it's for the customer experience but it puts undue stress on employees
good,"PNC is a great organization, but senior management is out of touch with the demands and day to day at the branch level.  Senior Management places more work load on Branch Managers to avoid overtime of other branch staff and have so much reporting requirements that it has created a micromanaged feel of an environment."
good,"Great Management , great place to work, senior management was top notch. The culture at PNC was incredible, I learned great sales processes, how to take a client from the beginning to end in he sales cycle."
good,"the neighborhood is nice."
good,If you work in the Giant In-Store Locations then you will be stressed out because you have to get accounts from customers coming into Giant to buy grocery's and you can only do so much.
good,"At PNC there is always something to do. Between cooking and preparing food and running it out to customers and filling orders, there is always something to do to keep you busy."
good,"Your a number, you punch in you clock out and then your home. Not alot of opportunity for growth or advancement if management has it out for you. Which is easy for them to do"
good,"PNC dismantled the mortgage department and is now rebuilding it.  I worked there when it was being dismantled.  In 2010 the company/ department was eliminated.  At that time, it was needed due to the mortgage crisis.  I am not aware of how it is now."
good,"PNC has a great culture, but within the small world of Business Credit managers have too much impact on your future given that you will never even once work with them. Travel can be tiring at times too in the Field Examiner role."
good,"Structured Team Environment i.e. BA, Developer, Architect, QA Manager and QA Analysts. "
good,"management didn't know how to realte to it's employees. so, employees alway felt disconnected from managers. Pay was not the best either."
good,PNC was a great company to work for till upper management changed. mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
good,"PNC is an awesome place to work. My typical work day is very busy, which I love. Here at Pnc, we try our best to keep our customers satisfied and we do our best at processing customers payments in a timely and professional manner. I've learned a great deal of things from the management team here like communication is always the key and how much it means to always be fair and consistent. The hardest part of my job is leaving at the end of the day and the most enjoyable part of my job is having the opportunity to work with a great team."
good,"Although the organization maybe a tad bit unorthodox, The company is overall a great opportunity for those who are just starting their career in sales."
good,"I worked at PNC for 7 years total, 2 as a temp and 5 as a FT employee. The best  part had to be the people I worked with. However, after several years of good reviews the compensation was meager at best and chance for advancement was difficult in both departments I worked in. They are trying to change that culture with job shadowing and working with employees to fit them into positions that best suit their talents but that is still probably a year or two off."
good,The pay is in the lower range of the industry but they treat their employees very well and are very big on the work life balance.
good,The business thrives on customer satisfaction. Employees are held accountable for accuracy and efficiency.
good,"Assisting customers with deposits, payments, withdrawals, savings bonds, account information, address changes, ordering checks, answering account questions, also assisting customers with their needs and helping to point them in the right direction to the person that they need to speak with whether that means they need a banker or they would need a financial adviser or even the mortgage department."
good,"I worked in a lockbox at PNC. We had several daily deadlines that we tried to meet with proficiency and accuracy. I learned to see how the way I did my job affected the rest of my department."
good,Good learning experience but not my dream job. PNC is a stable and reputable company.
good,"Reviewed appraisals. set values, collected property related data via internet + othe sources. Fielded loan officer requests via phone and e-mail. Colaborated with management to exceed management expectations."
good,Working in a multi-layered management organization can be both challenging and rewarding. Working with several different managerial leaders has given me the opportunity to become myself a better leader.
good,"Sales focused, time management a demand. likeable environment. The best part was the flexibility in schedule."
good,"PNC has been very good to me. I started fresh out of college and I have learned a lot. Unfortunately, there are not a lot chances for advancement in my Line of Business."
good,I work at a very busy branch and we service a large number of customers on a daily basis. All of my co-workers are great and enjoy working with them. We are like a family. I love to make sure the customers needs are met and they know they are very valuable to me and the company.
good,PNC strives hard to maintain and improve controls. It is constantly growing through strategic integration with existing banks and review of current banking locations.
good,"My time at PNC was made enjoyable by the people I worked with, very personable and made me feel at home while always willing to help me with whatever questions I had making that aspect of the job very positive. I learned to not sit back and expect to be told what to do but take iniative and ask what it is that is expected of me. The only negative I could really say was, and this might have only been my department, their complete disorganization and lack of communication leaving me to feel very much in the dark as to what was going on and what I should be doing almost my entire stint there not to mention that management left a lot to be desired. She was never available and slow to respond to any inquiries we might have, in her defense she had a lot on her plate but for that reason she should have never been the sole manager and go to person responsible for such a small department as she was very out of touch and clueless as to what went on with us."
good,"Overall an excellent place to work.  Work life balance is respectful.  Opportunities for advancement are limited, and training is a work in progress but generally overall a great work environment."
good,"I got to work with awesome co workers, leads and managers. The pay was low but the bonuses made up for the low pay. You controlled your own bonus. It wasn't easy but if you took the recommendations it was easy."
good,Best inquire jobs with PNC HR recruiters or connect with employees via LinkedIn or find contract companies to work with PNC.  Find someone to connect to help you get a job at PNC.
good,"I was a PNC bank teller, I enjoyed the environment and training. I learned a lot really fast and believe the way it was taught was very easy to retain."
good,You'll learn a lot and get great benefits. Compensation not the best raises were rare. It is a good company to start off at I didn't have much opportunity to grow there.
good,Not a bad place to work. It’s Just an under paying job position but I would still recommend it to someone especially if you’re looking to start a career in banking.
good,"Gained knowledge about the Loan Origination System. The work environment was very challenging and the team was collaborative and supportive, I enjoyed my tenure."
good,"there are many opportunities within the company, you must be meeting your goals to be  considered for said opportunities,  it is important to stay focused and work hard."
good,Relationship building with other lines of business provide a great experience in this company.  Progressive in technology.  Serious about risk management and compliance.
good,Good place to work and learn. PNC Financial services provides lot of flexibility in terms of working. Very good work culture and fun working in  PNC Financial services
good,Great customers to serve and friendly co-workers.  You must be able to handle even the most difficult customer.  If you have a genuine love for people this may be a good fit for you.
good,very good job to have good for promotions and experience the money isn't the best as they are other banks out there that pay more and are better with bonuses
good,"PNC overall is not a bad place to work (depending on your location and the turnover rate.) They have employee awards and events to attend. Volunteer hours that you get back as paid time off. They don't like overtime so you're more likely to leave on time and not have to worry about work after leaving."
good,This company is committed to work life balance and customer excellence. I have grown and really flourished professionally during my time here and appreciate the stability of the job.
good,"PNC is a large, conservative bank.  Credit/risk runs the show.  It is a well run and well managed bank.  Corporate culture was toxic at times with new managers coming in to our business unit.  Didn't make for a productive environment.  That said, lots of quality employees."
good,"•	Effectively manage all of the risks associated with the business objectives and activities."
good,"There could continue to be more work on diversity and inclusion as the job grades get higher.   Also, would like to see more opportunites for growth for existing employees."
good,Lots of career advancement opportunities. Overall excellent company values and ideals. Company culture is all about community involvement and maintaining an excellent reputation in the marketplace
good,"I really appreciate and thank you so much for all of the opportunities this company has provided me which has not only helped but, is helping me to grow technically, professionally as well as personally. I have learned so much in these past 2 years (and still learning from this great place), and will never forget the kindness of management and all of my colleagues."
good,I love my job. The pay was great and the benefits weren’t that bad either. The job lacked management and consistency. There were too many chiefs and not enough Indians and no one controlled it. The employees act like children and the drama is unbearable but no one controls it.
good,"PNC was a good place to start my career and gain training amd opportunities. There are really great people working here."
good,I was a loyal and dedicated PNC employee who was displaced due to expense reduction and management restructure.  I was a company ambassador and planned on retiring from my company. I have the utmost respect for PNC even though my position was eliminated.
good,Some departments have taken away and/or limited flexible work arrangement benefits that has lead to a mass exit of longtime employees which has severely affected morale
good,"Good Company to work for and very good people to work with. Management could be better with monitoring staff assignments."
good,The company is a good place to work. People are friendly and are willing to help for the most part. There is room to grow if you put the time in. Peers are friendly depending on branch.
good,"Every morning starts with a quick start to leverage what we plan to achieve. From the moment we open the branch, clients are ready for us to process their transactions and provide them with solutions for their every day money management needs."
good,Love the products so it was easy to sell.  Aggressive goals but achievable.  Bonus structure was not great for a smaller branch.  Plenty of training.  Nice atmosphere.
good,PNC is a good place to work. The office I work for are smaller than other offices in our network so career advancement is almost nil. The opportunities here are driven by the employee and how much you want to grow. For senior level positions though you would have to be open to relocating.
good,I was a bssrt and greatly enjoyed most of my time with PNC. I learned a lot about banking products thanks to PNC's awesome education program and there were many talks of advancement potential early in my career.
good,"PNC is a good place to work at if you've just graduated from college. It's a great starting point in building your communication, organization and time management skills."
good,"I believe PNC is a good company to work for.  They offer many competitive benefits for their employees, I worked at PNC for 24 years and was given many opportunities to advance my career thru job training opportunities.  PNC takes pride in their employees in wanting them to do their best."
good,This project taught me the basics of how to create a career opportunity in the Financial industry. Great experience and learning opportunities with excellent management and team.
good,Management cares about you as a person and is willing to help you succeed.  There are lots of opportunities to advance your career and explore other careers within the company.
good,Enjoyed working there. My specific department did not allow for any kind of advancement and the pay was not consistent with my 15+ years of experience.
good,"very fast paced but great people to work with, cut throat hours and a stiff working hours but management is fair if you talk to them for wiggle room. always room to advance"
good,"Unable to give an adequate opinion at this time. Recent market turmoil has made for unusual internal dynamics. Overall, a supportive environment with some ambiguity."
good,At the time the nation's largest home purchase mortgage lender. I was able to work with some exceptional individuals in leadership here. Some of the most important things about mentoring started with this company for me.
good,Great company to work for.  They cared about their employees and took care of them.  A person could see a great career path that could be followed. Would recommend.
good,"Nice People, a decent amount of hard working individuals. Company is open to finding a job that is of interest to you. Salary growth is hard to achieve. Decent benefits."
good,Fast paced work environment with excellent benefits and great opportunity for advancement. Enjoyed working for this company for the five years I was employed.
good,If you are looking for a long career with the ability to grow within the same company than PNC is the place for you. great benefits and great vacation time. Worked with customers to meet their banking goals and needs . Work the phones and greet customers with a friendly helping smile
good,Good people make a good company. Sometimes people get lost in the business. Automation is taking over which concerns me about people. The bank is very involved in communities it is currently present.
good,"For personal reasons, I do not wish to review this job or company at this time. Thank you for your understanding in this matter. It is sincerely appreciated."
good,"Cannot elaborate on how it is to work now since it has been years since I left the company. However, benefits were competitive and management was always supportive."
good,The people were easy to work with. The hours were not my favorite. Job was interesting. Had to do a few steps rather then just sitting and doing one thing.
good,If you like data entry and sitting for prolonged periods then the job can be rewarding. A typical day is logging in and begin to enter data into database.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know my coworkers and bank customers as friends.  There were challenging people in both areas but were definitely in the minority number wise.
good,"Good knowledge of the various process happening in the bank environment"
good,"Job was good,Coworkers were great Management was not good. Expected us to reach goals with limited assistance and would get them blame for coming up short on bank goals even when we met our individual goals."
good,"PNC is a great place to work but it is hard to move upward in your field. There are limited positions availble. At my 2 year mark I asked for a raise or even insight on some job opportunities and I was turned down on both after being praised for all the great work I’ve done. It might be just my manager, but I definitely does not look good upon the company."
good,"The company is great if you're interested in getting your foot through the door for banking; however, the commission is only if you get a certain threshold of accounts. The in-store branches have almost no life/work balance and have made the goals more difficult for the branch. My senior staff members have been with the company around 2 years and they make around the same salary as I do when I've been there roughly 8 months. It's a great learning experience as well as a good place to start if you're interested in banking."
good,"PNC is a good company, but the role I took I'm overqualified for. For this reason the work became incredibly monotonous. Great company, competitive pay, but I'm kicking myself for taking the role I did."
good,"Typical day at work is reaching out to customers and/or waiting on customers from the lobby to make sure their financial needs are taken care of"
good,PNC has offers employees ample opportunities to learn and develop into roles best suited for them to succeed. The company promotes healthy work-life balance and a sense of camaraderie between management and staff.
good,"I worked at this bank for four years learning all I could to advance. But it seemed on some fronts that it was hard to get ahead unless you knew someone in the ranks. Sometimes the work is hard when you are dealing with rude clients. I've had days where clients made me furious and used their entitlement to look down on what I did there. But there were a lot of great times too. There are some clients who make what you do worth while. However, considering all that is required to do the job safely the pay isn't worth it. Especially if you are working as a teller. I did the BSSR position and MORE for two years with no pay increase and very little hope of advancement considering the efforts I went through to help bring my branch to greater heights."
good,"PNC is a good company to work for depending on position. Work life balance is tested throughout the company. Pay doesn't match the work load. Besides those reasons, PNC is a good bank to start a financial career."
good,"Great place to work, undergoing some changes.  Client focused.  Strong compliance culture with excellent attention to risk management.  Improving compensation programs.  Product lines are very good in all lines of business."
good,"Company focused on operational effectiveness and customer satisfaction.  Enjoyed the culture that promoted transparency and collaboration, with the objective of ""doing the right thing""."
good,PNC was a great place to work I feel like I gained a lot of experience working there. The people I worked with were great as well as the supervisors and they were always there to help if needed
good,"Good benefits, flexible work arrangements, strict attire requirements, 9-5 bank work day for most people, no parking at corporate office, nice friendly coworkers"
good,PNC provides a very extensive training program to help build knowledge and gain an understanding of Bank Regulations.  There is limited room for advancement which makes it a good place to start your career.
good,"I would prefer not to answer or provide a review on the bank.   I do not have an opinion for or against working here, therefore, I am electing to not complete."
good,"I enjoyed working for PNC.  The training was extensive in the Loan Solutions department, but the training in the Sanction Screening department was more of a self-taught situation."
good,"PNC is a good place to work.  Strong core values, and very stable.  I gained a lot of knowledge and exposure working at PNC, but opportunities in Columbus are limited within the HR space.  Overall, I would recommend PNC as a positive employer."
good,"I have enjoyed working at PNC, everyone were professional, I was one of the underwriter who started in the beginning of PNC's mortgage department in Illinois. I would love to work there again if opportunity is available for a remote position."
good,Highly reliable and focused Personal Banker with an exceptional client service record and extraordinary depth of loan and credit knowledge. Able to explain complex financial management concepts to a wide variety of professional and non-professional audiences. Adept at working independently or as part of a professional banking team.
good,"typical customer service, very nice work culture. Hard to get the shift you want,but I think things have changed. management was great and the morale was good!"
good,Not all employees were treated equally. Some employees were favored more than others. Employees would talk about one another instead of working together as a team. They would make it a difficult atmosphere to work in. It was hard to transfer to other branches.
good,"not a bad place to start, great training is provided but the pay is super minimal and raises are far and few in between. "
good,"Solid workplace environment with good work life balance.  Managers genuinely cared about employee career development.  Not as quick to change as some companies, but a solid place to work."
good,Training was concise and helpful. Felt prepared to do the job from day one. Welcoming staff that were always there to assist. Able to balance home and work when my child was younger.
good,PNC financial services is a great company to work for to start a career in banking or as a manager looking to advance. If you have a passion for banking you will do well. Many of the people I worked with were pleasant and fun to build relationships with. I would recommend PNC to a friend.
good,"Very compliance oriented, however the advancement opportunities are non-existent. I want to be in management and want to have a home where I may be able to share my experiences and success with my team."
good,From what I've hear my experience with PNC is strictly based on the department I work in. The lack of organization and communication is astounding. I am excited to see what the rest of this company is like.
good,The PNC location in Whitehall is a great place to work. Business Casual attire. People want to work but it's not cutthroat. Management is supportive. Everyone seems to enjoy being here.
good,"Very laid back environment and plenty of opportunity to grow yourself as an authority in sales and finance. They have some great tools, resources and trainers that help you at every stage of you career at PNC."
good,"The working culture of PNC became stale as the years went by, where the overall mood was flexible but firm too being ridged and stressed.  Employee relationships went from a family based atmosphere to an environment of strangers."
good,The job is good on team work and help. Some days are fast paced some days a little slow. The hardest part would be not getting stressed on a fast paced day. I would say I enjoy interacting with coworkers. I learned how to type faster. I learned how to challenge myself and believe in myself.
good,"Great organization to work for , management cares for employees and provide good support when needed . Management was patient and honest lot of work and overtime as needed . staff consisted o  younger generation and older employees which shgw an adequate balance"
good,"Pleasant atmosphere within the corporation.  Management was "
good,"Lots of room for advancement. Pleasant working conditions, good managers and co-workers.  No micromanagement of employees.  The hardest part of the job was the technology."
good,I loved this job. I like to help others learn things. In this role I had the opportunity to teach others and help them grow within the company. Very nice environment in this department.
good,the job was very faced paced learned alot about cross selling and how to sell to people doing their grocery shopping and having to compete with a tradition branch that is in the same shopping center
good,"Typical corporate setting, including cubicles and offices.  Good entry-level position with opportunity for advancement.  Work culture can vary dependind on the team."
good,It's a good company to work for however the hours in the department makes it's difficult to balance your personal life. Some weeks are 8 day straight without a break.
good,NA  I worked as a consultant and do not have an opinion My time there was fine. I was treated well and enjoyed the people on the team I worked with and the people at the site I worked at were friendly.
good,Good place to work ok benefits. Make sure you negotiate well when coming in hard to get a raise. Many opportunities to move around and a lot of EBERGS to get involved with.
good,"Although some branches can differ from the one I work at, my branch is always busy and can get a little bit overwhelming. Hours are good but can be changed at a moments notice. Overtime happens a lot. The crew I work with is great and I like doing what I do but Its not a place I want to retire from. I got a degree in art and would like to do something regarding my degree."
good,"Company overall is a great company to work for.  Good work-life balance, culture, and i have learned a lot about networking with individuals.  Love working at PNC Bank."
good,Great bank with great products for customers.  Incentive based pay so it does not work in small town settings.  Management is solid.  Daily grind to generate new business.
good,"Enjoy my manager and co workers but pay is awful, very low.  Good benefits, time off.  The company has very unrealistic goals for desk folks and expect way too much for the compensation they provide."
good,PNC has a great flexible schedule that allows me to work my job around my everyday activities. I have learned how to better communicate with customer over the phone verses my the traditional face to face way. The management works one on one with you to help improve your performance and answer questions.
good,I worked there many years ago...the building is no longer there and I am not even sure if the department is still there. I encoded fields onto the actual check and had to balance each deposit.
good,"Great place to work, good management.  This is my second time working for PNC Bank and I love what I do.  A typical day is that I am not micromanaged.  I continue to learn each day.  The culture is good.  I really enjoy coming into work each day.  The only con is that my position is in Downtown Pittsburgh where you have to may to park, however that is not job duty related."
good,"Working at PNC is like working at any other bank. You run transactions, open accounts, do loan applications for cars, mortgages, lines of credit, as well as make referrals."
good,PNC Bank is an encouraging place to work with great management and opportunities to advance your career.  The company has a wide variety of options to fit the career you are looking for and will work with you to help you land the position you desire.
good,It's been over 20 years since I worked for this company. While I was there I enjoyed my time there. I advanced steadily through the company. The pay was comparable.
good,My workday was predictable and productive.  Several years of data entry.Enjoyed the employee appreciation programs and perks.  PC really supported family issues
good,The company has many career growth opportunities and promotes professional development. Some departments offer a better work/life balance than others.
good,"PNC was a good company to work for.  I left at a time when there was much transition going on.  I was the 11th of 13 underwriters that left in a 4 month time period."
good,For the most part PNC has been a great place of employment. The regional leadership is great and they make sure to give you quality training during your time as an employee. They ensure that their employees are well versed in the things the company stands for.
good,"The company is pretty great, when I first started working at this bank I enjoyed it very much. As time went on we got new people and it became similar to high school."
good,Uncomfortable and overly demanding work environment.   Human resources unpleasant to deal with.  An environment that did not promote internal promotions.
good,I loved working at the bank. i got t meet alot of different people. i also was able to do some networking while i was there. the days there went by pretty fast as long as you had something to do. the staff there for the most part was awesome

good,I really learned a lot during my time at pnc.  the people were great and still keep in touch with them. it was really good place to work
good,"Dedicated employees, family-friendly place to work. "
good,When I started PNC I loved it. There was a shift in management that made it slightly unbearable at times. There is a lot of cattiness working with a lot of women.
good,"Good place to work with great pay and benefits, however the culture there is the worst. this is typically what you get when working as an union employee."
good,"Being part of a data science team, we gathered business requirements and mapped them to various sources of data. Analyzed large data sets by running Hive queries and Pig scripts"
good,I really enjoy working for PNC Bank.  I'm just looking for a schedule that's Monday through Friday. Overall PNC is a great place to work. I also enjoy Employee Appreciation Week every year. It really makes employees feel appreciated.
good,"Job was easy for me to understand and do the work. While challenging for some co workers,it was a great place to grow and be a leader."
good,"If you are not part of the click in the location were you are hired, you will not make in.  May branchs are short help and have levels that are normally to high to hit and this is why there turn over is so high"
good,"In the beginning, I truly enjoyed working for PNC Bank but as time went on, I began to feel less and less appreciated. A lot was required of me with little reward. I felt like I could not give clients the best customer service and that cooperate did not care about clients needs."
good,We were required to perform multiple functions in a day. Management was very encouraging and pushed us to do our best. My co-workers were always very positive and helpful. Most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help the customer's with their financial problems.
good,Overall a good company to work for. I made tons of friends at this employer. During my time there pay was much better than what I heard it is today though.
good,High goals were given which you can can only achieve if you have every team member on board. Daily team huddles to know the areas of focus we needed to work on. Learning the strengths and weakness of each and every team member and working off of them.You spent so much time with your fellow team mates you would create a family bond.
good,"My position is prospect deadline oriented. Support the sales team."
good,"A typical day at an in-store PNC bank would be from 10am-730pm"
good,"All in all I have been impressed with PNC as a company. They have taught me a lot and I learn new things every day."

good,Great time. Great people. Great leadership. Great working environment in my opion. Think it was awsome I would go back if offered.
good,"There is a lot of multi-tasking for various loan jobs.  Management and co-workers are excellent, helpful and we get along very well."

good,"Most days are longer than the ""traditional"" 7.5-8 hours."
good,I learned to sell and talk with customer to see hat their personal need was as far as banking. it more to bank teller then just cashing and depositing check. you have a change to move up in the company by knowing the company

I wasn't always head and senior teller. it was during my 21 years there at National City Bank/PNC."
good,"From the start of the business day to the close of business there is a constant flow of work production.  The ability to multi task is essential.  Policy and procedures are updated on a regular basis and one must be able to comprehend and adapt the new policy and procedures into the daily flow of work.  The management staff has a open door policy and make it possible for all employees to bring ideas and concerns to the table. Our co workers are not just team members, we are more like family.  The hardest part of the day is the day immediate changes must implemented and uncertainty arises but we do have a excellent supporting staff to assists.  Team huddles are a enjoyable part of the day.  This is when the teams come together and review previous day work numbers and give shout outs and offer encouragement for the day."
good,"Commercial  lending position. Cold call, service clients, cross sell, credit underwriting.  At that time credit had a local presence."
good,PNC is a large corporation.  PNC is spread out throughout the country.  There are many opportunities if you want to move out of your state.
good,I could not have been happier with my time at PNC Mortgage. It was a great opportunity which I found to be very helpful for my career. Management really strives to be great.
good,PNC offers job security but without a degree is very hard to land a promotion. Had bad managers and fantastic managers. Large company with good benefits.

good,"The working environment is corporate and yet family friendly at the same time. While the company is large, it is not overwhelming in size and locations in the United States are found within certain pockets along the east coast and southern states."
good,PNC Bank has been a great place for me to work. They have provided me with great job security and the people I work with in my local branch are wonderful.
good,"During my tenure, I have had the opportunity to learn more about the banking line of business, and the loan documentation process."
good,"Enjoyed my time at PNC, Due to the smaller workload in our department, was displaced."
good,A development program with supportive management to help you grow and develop into a manager. Several training sessions to help teach about different aspects of banking and the different products and services that the company has to offer.
good,Fun place to work.  Get to know and meet lots of people.  Not a lot of work life balance where I am available for my kids and their needs.  Lots of politics for trying to move on in the company.  For my particular location there is a great team to work with and everyone is like family and is always supporting and helping each other to be successful.
good,"good work place, management needs more support from upper management, better training for employees.  For the amount of money the company brings in, employees should be paid more."
good,"PNC Bank has taken on the challenge of growing demand for technology, the need for ease in banking all while keeping a personal relationship with each customer as the company continues grow."
good,A typical at work includes assisting customers with their banking needs.  Identifying ways that benefit customers with their financial well being.  Working as a team player to drive one common goal.
good,"Your day can go from dull to busy in the blink of an eye. With time you learn what days are going to be busy and hopefully things can be adjusted. Customers can be demanding but I have learned that there are three types. The first is the accepting of their mistakes and are just looking for explanation as to why. When you fix their problem are great full. There's the it's your fault and nothing you can do makes them happy. Then there's the what can you do for me. Employees, including management have become a culture of watching out for number one at whatever cost. Lately PNC has become a company that see's you as the amount of widgets you bring in not an individual no matter how hard you work"
good,"PNC call center was a fun but at times very stressful work enviorment.  We dealt with 100 different customers with 100 different issues or requests every day. The fact that we were behind the scenes and only customer service, we were only able to do so much, dealing with people and their money and not understanding how the process works, it wasn't always possible to make the customer happy.  I have a stronger understanding to these processes when it comes to my personal accounts, it also gives me a greater respect for the customer service represenitives that continue to do that type of work."
good,"inbound/outbound calls via a dialer system called catch to take mortgage pmts. set payment arrangements to prevent possible foreclosure."
good,"Overall the company had a lot of positives to offer. Great benefits, positive work environment, decent management, and efffective training programs."
good,Sales is a difficult and competitive field.  The support of the team makes it a fun and rewarding experience.  It is a great way to learn to personalize and speak intelligently to potential clients.
good,"As soon as I come in the call volume is normally at an overflow. I have learned how to enroll and navigate through all our online banking data bases, and I can normally always troubleshoot any problems as far as technical goes. Management always seems to be changing in some sort of aspect, not necessarily the people in management but the roles and what they do do. I love, adore, and respect all my co workers, and all the individual leadership the offer. The hardest part about my job is the constant technical issues not being resolved, and  are customers always being on hold for more then 20 minutes every time they call are Care Center. The most enjoyable part about my job is the recognition and the time they find to recognize the employees for the small things."
good,PNC is a great company at which to be an employee. My only complaint is that the extremely risk-averse policies can sometimes be a barrier to making progress.
good,good communication by management and team between bar and restaurant as well.  Had bands on the weekends and made for a very exciting work day and night.
good,Enjoy working at PNC bank. Great place to lean and great co-worker. Retail environment lots of selling and customer service
good,"Bankers job i Liked it, Helping Customers out was my favorite putting a smile on their face, getting them approved for a new loan or a new mortgage."
good,PNC was a nice place to work but advancement was slow and not consistant. Great leaders in place to try and help you as much as they can.
good,"Great customers and coworkers, family like setting."
good,"A typical day at work will consist of 25% of customer service, 25% teller, and 50% sales. I've learned to pull in customers from the supermarket to the branch and uncover their financial needs to complete a share of wallet. Management can be very pushy about sales but they definitely provide us recognition for accomplishing our goals. Full staff at the branch is a maximum of 5 employees including the manager. The hardest part of the job is overcoming the fear of approaching customers while they are food shopping. The most enjoyable part of the job is saving my customers time and money after recommending/closing the best products and services for them."
good,I started off with the company as a processor for my current position now. I looking for a change I really have learned a lot here and now I'm time to move forward and try my hand at something else. The hardest part for me working here is working the weekend been on the weekend for 10 year now. The part I do enjoy is my co-works
good,I enjoyed working for PNC Bank. They offered tuition reimbursement. I also liked the fact that they had 401k and many other good opportunities within the company.
good,HSBC gave me many chances for promotions and experience which I will always appreciate. At the time I was employed there the salary was poor but the benefits were very good.
good,"This company has 5 star star training for its employees. They offer lots to enures they know what everyone is doing and they offer advancement. "
good,PNC was a wonderful place to work.  Company downsizing is understandable when foreclosure is at a low.  I simply wish I was able to continue my career at PNC.  I was laid off a few months shy of my 10 year anniversary.
good,Management is not chosen wisely. Employees are constantly receiving mixed messages. Customers are hard to come by considering all the competition. The banker role is good for someone who is very driven.
good,"Working for PNC has been a great opportunity because not only are they committed to their employees, but they are always 100 percent about the customer and providing the best customer service there is. A typical day for me is investigating and researching the roots of any and all problems that occur within our customers accounts. I do business daily with not only PNC customer's but other banks. I adjust our customer's account(s) accordingly and respond efficiently and timely to any deadline. Being able to be there for the customer all day every day, is great. We do the best we can to meet every customer's needs and expectations to simply make PNC a great place to bank."
good,Working here has given me great customer service skills.The hardest part of the job is meeting the demands of corporate while trying to perform daily functions. Unrealistic expectations for tellers.
good,I loved coming to work everyday to talk to my coworkers and customers but that's about it. There's nothing more left to say about working at PNC
good,"This is a fast paced, ever changing environment.  The most difficult piece to the job, is the volume of work, but the most gratifying is solving a client's needs, and working with others that have the same goals as you."
good,"I enjoy the coworkers I have, although I feel underpaid in comparison to other banks. We got Human Sigma 6 and were promised a reward for outstanding service and received nothing"
good,"If you enjoy being outside for the heat and a summer job, enjoying all the awesome concerts held in your town this would be a recommended job for you."
good,"Installed, Configured and administered WebLogic server 10.3.6 for development, testing and production environment on RHEL6.4 platform"
good,"Worked for this company for 3 years, Very good management team at the time."
good,There is opportunity to learn from your coworkers but there is a lack of management assistance to see you move forward in your position.
good,I really felt like PNC cared about me as a person. This is an amazing company to work for and they really do take care of their employees. Compensation isn't as good as it should be but they take their time to train you and they are interested in helping you grow.
good,"Great place to work for, good benefits and even better coworkers. I cant complain about management either"
good,Coworkers are very enjoyable and a great place to work if hours of down time is something you enjoy.
good,Overall I have learned more about Human Sigma and leadership through a Human Sigma lens.
good,"Fast paced environment "
good,"I enjoy working for PNC but it is not where I see myself in 10 years. A typical day at work would involve helping customer make deposit, withdrawls, etc. from their accounts. Also, meeting daily goals like opening new checking accounts and generating new leads for loans and investments. One of the main goals I focused on was making sure I was doing what was best for the customer and trying to help them for their future."
good,"working there was a pleasure, great staff, stress free job."
good,"A typical day would be taking calls from our internal and external customers when they had domestica and international wires. I learned different areas like risk, confirming wires with high dollar amounts, verified incoming wires with the correct PNC account number. Management is really great to all of us and I get along really well with all of my coworkers. The hardest part of the job was when we were told on 9/18 that we would no longer have our jobs as of 11/21/14. The most enjoyable part of the job was doing what I do best as a customer service rep and winning employee of the month award."
good,"A typical day at work include me completing various service requests for customers and opening new accounts. I've learned so much about banking in this position. Each day is an adventure and although some co-workers may seem to ruin each day, I have still come to love what I do. The hardest part of my job is to go to my new manager for advice or assistance."
good,It is a nice place to work. The hours are nice and the pay isnt bad. Be ready to meet a wide range of people.
good,Good working environment with good values. Management was flexible with scheduling and co-workers made it feel like home.
good,employees and management in the department that I worked were very nice and friendly. I was able to learn several differentt jobs and was promoted within. My supervisor encouraged me to advance.
good,PNC was when I was able to branch off and begin the journey of a personal banker. Which gave me independence and I learned a lot of time management. Basically working as your own manager was the highlight was my career. Working in Giant didn't give you the same banking environment as a traditional bank. I helped most of my co workers since I was very knowable and I enjoyed them all.

Working at the bank allowed me to assist many clients with their financial needs. This would make them happy and that would make me feel good about myself. I enjoy assisting people with their needs. My co-workers and myself got along and that make us work well as a team.
good,"Everyday we were active in marketing our products and services to our customers. We needed to provide a ""go-getter"" attitude. Management was actively involved in ways to improve the achievement of our daily goals. The hardest part of the job was finding new and innovative ways to gain business. Banking is very competitive these days. The most enjoyable part was building relationships with my customers and improving their financial well-being."

I enjoy working with and supporting a wide range of personalities. It keeps me well rounded and proves that I can adapt to change and uncertainty.

I enjoyed the people I worked with and the outside vendors very much.  The job was time sensitive, but I was able to complete it and do a good job. I won several awards for accuracy as well as productivity. I received a great deal of daily information that I still use today."
good,"Work / Personal life balance was amazing - flexible hours, work from home ability, etc.  Cant beat it."
good,management not around a lot and part timers had to work every Saturday.
good,"This branch is considered a banking center which means it has higher volumes of transactions and customers on a daily basis. I handle many different types of transactions including cashing checks, deposits, payments, etc. I am also responsible for referring customers for different products PNC as to offer including credit cards, investments, and different types of accounts.

good,PNC was a great company to work for.  Your days go by fast and customer interactions as well as co-worker interactions were enjoyable.  The hardest part about the job is learning everything required and doing it quickly and efficiently.  It all comes with time though.

I also learned about banking products and services that the company had.  My co-workers were always enjoyable to work with.

I always have to be proactive in an effort to find the new business the bank needs"
good,Dual and sole custody opening procedures. Daily cash balancing. Meeting daily and quarterly sales goals. There were 5-7 other consultants on the floor at all times so there was competition.

I also worked on our corporate support and help desk which allowed me to opportunity to deal with the bank branches, loan officers, high end customers, our help desk allowed me to opportunity to be a team-lead to help out reps on the floor, and make supervisory decisions when it came to customer situations. I eventually moved on within the company to take on new skills and became a mortgage insurance processor. This department was the total opposite, I don’t have to deal with customers, i don’t have to talk on the phone at all. I have the ability to work at my own pace but still have productivity and quality standards to meet. I really love this department and my co workers; I enjoyed learning FHA/HUD processes and about MIP insurance. It gave a new aspect on the mortgages, and the company. It allotted me the opportunity to gain new knowledge and experience."
good,"Working at PNC Bank has given me very valuable experience in the banking/financial field.

good,While at PNC Bank / Mortgage I created and maintained over 400 new customers. I sent out quarterly newsletters about the mortgage industry and the latest information about my own personal life.
good,PNC is a solid growing company that values their employees.
good,"System is little dated. It's sometimes hard to see the company's strategy from your perspective in a specific line of business, and depending on what department you are in you may feel disconnected from the customer/business partners you work with or work for"
good,"If your job is your only priority, work here.  Otherwise find somewhere else.  If you want call nights and selling, this is the job for you.  I enjoyed the people I worked with but selling and being the smallest branch and trying to carry the entire region for goals was too much."
good,"It’s not a bad place to work but morale is pretty low at the moment due to large queue sizes, mismanagement by executives who don’t know how to do our job but are trying to save money. All of which causes bad work life balance. Also wages aren’t competitive with other companies, we do the job of three and get paid much less for one"
good,It was a nice work environment and pay was very well. It was a new program so there were some kinks that needed worked out but the people were wonderful.
good,The mortgage industry goes up and down and you cannot control how the business have to displace and hire. Overall they were family oriented and provided time off as needed.

good,"Time management is critical. You are puled alot of different directions; sales/prospecting,customer service issues,meetings, conference calls, meeting with other partners."
good,"I have been working from home for about 4 years so that is the best perk to get. I go into the office 2 times per month, but not all departments get this perk. Getting a 1-2% raise each year is nothing exciting to say the least. Benefits are good though including vacation time."
good,"Pnc is a pretty ok company to work for. My branch was in an awesome location.  Even though my branch had a high turnover, I had the opportunity to work with some great people"
good,"PNC is an excellent bank to learn about the financial industry for someone with no experience. Excellent customer service for clients, great work-life balance, incentives, etc. Sales goals can sometimes be unrealistic. Regional Manager focuses on weaknesses and missed opportunities without congratulating strengths and accomplishments. I used to love my branch and the clients and I wanted to advance with them, but they make it impossible to get a promotion. If you are willing to put years of service into one branch, this is the job for you! If you are looking to grow with an organization, then it's possible but only if your are willing to relocate with every step."
good,Great place to learn new skills as they keep up with technology changes. However the flexible work environment is not very flexible and constantly changes every quarter depending on what new director thinks they know best.
good,"No complaints.  Typical bank environment. Stingy at times, but taking steps to do all the right things. Good pay and decent benefits.  Great location in Center City"
good,"I am not able to write a very thorough or detailed review due to my tenure at the company being so short.  That was due to the fact that the project that we were to work on got pulled and a minimum of 18 month delay being put on it due to the subject matter experts being pulled into another, similar project so one had to take a back seat."
good,"The PNC name is well know, yet the way businesses is handled doesn't go hand by hand. Additionally,  the safety was a risky issue since to access the bolt was not protected"
good,"* Constant changes- company and environment"
good,Every manager knows one another. Can be good can be bad. Bad when trying to promote yourself but manager doesnt agree...working in a small environment has its challenges
good,i had a good an overall good experience working for PNC. The company cared about quality of life. My direct manager was available to help facilitate success
good,"The experienced bankers on UC's campus can become a little hostile when there is someone new and threatening around. But, overall it's not a bad place to work given you know the right people."
good,"Great company to work for.  Although there was tremendous amount of stress for trying to achieve  monthly and quarterly quota’s, interactions with customers and my coworkers was a good experience. The overall environment made everything much more enjoyable. Excellent benefits upward mobility and many avenues to take within the company."
good,"Good place to work, promotion is who you know not what you know. All federal holidays off and good vacation and sick leave. Navigating management can be tricky"
good,"You have an opportunity to work with some very smart and driven people, it is an overall collaborative environment with great culture surrounding each position"
good,Got opportunity to learn a lot at my branch under managers guidance. Lot my procedures and policies reviewed which as a customer i didn't know. Had fun learning.
good,"Overall good place to work, advancement is questionable  Lot of internall job postings.  Always will to help, employees very friendly and always will to help when needed.  Management is good, always there and will to assist when needed.  Have become very micromanaged recently. hardest part of the job is being micromanaged, conversations with customers have become very scripted and do not develop relationships as easy. The most enjoyable part of the job is the teamwork provided from the team. We all work well together and help each other when needed,  The hardest part of the job is being micromanaged,"
good,"Dont expect Christmas bonuses or competative rates compared to the industry. They let you work from home and do good deeds and are a trustworthy bank."
good,"With this, as any customer service job, ther is an opportunity to build rapport and relationships with your customers. This was something I loved with this job. But if there is a harassment issue don’t waste your time because HR with do nothing to help you. I called three times over the course of two months and my problem was dismissed."
good,Overall a good place to work but very limited advancement for investments but lots of advancement for retail positions. Very good continued education and never leave without an answer for clients
good,pnc bank was ok. the managers i worked for were very nice and most employees there were always willing to help you if needed. just didnt like being on phones all day and every minute was crucial to be on phones.
good,This is a great place to work with many opportunities for advancement. Management will back you as much as they can and will help you grow in the company.  Good sense of work-life balance as well.
good,"Answer calls from customers about their checking and savings, fees, atm's and deposits."
good,"Micromanagement and no work life balance, cultural shift to a more confrontational environment. Department morale is low, more verbal and written warnings are given."
good,"You are clocked with everything you do on the computer. Every second you're not ""auto in"" they subtract that from your schedule adherence. Realistically you have about 30 minutes to be out of adherence. They really stress being in adherence. Although you cant just end a call when you want so one long complicated call could easily put you out of adherence. You have two 15 minute breaks, but again a call can easily go all the way through that break. You then have to decide whether to take that break and risk not being in adherence for the day. So you could realistically be taking calls for 4 hours straight if you have a call that takes up your whole break. Got to go to the bathroom, thats going to be counted against your schedule adherence if you cant hold it until your lunch or regular break. "
good,PNC Investments was a great place to work. Great culture however we were limited in how we could help clients. My managers were great but their power to make decisions was very limited. It was definitely a place that gave you the tools to succeed if you wanted to put in the work.
good,"Not a bad place.   Good hard working people.  Enjoyed working multiple partners, both internal and external.   Provided quality customer service in the business banking industry."
good,"Typical day was answering multiple phone calls, having to help customers with their credit cards, questions and problems. The management wasn't supportive.  Very critical of your phone calls and how you handled the customers."
good,"Very difficult place to work. Poor management, excessive politics and infighting. The computer systems are 'pre-historic' - and have not been updated in over 20 years. A task that would take 5 mins in a modern bank like Wells Fargo or BOA, takes hours here. "
good,"Ups and downs at this company. Compensation good. They micro-manage their management staffs and don't allow sense to dictate. At Bank Of America the management staff was allowed to run their branch as they needed, not so at PNC."
good,"Standard testing and analyzation of books and records of PNCBC clients. The process allows you to work in various industries with a quick learning process of how each business operates. Managing various personalities, in an effort to create a relaxing atmosphere for customers to keep the flow of information at a quick pace."
good,They really needed help as far as management and co workers. i worked at three different branches and they cut my training short so i didn't really know much i had to learn as i went and i only had a branch manger for the 1st month that i was there.
good,Equal parts exhausting and rewarding. Long hours and very high pressure timelines with lofty expectations.  That said the rewards of being successful in this environment make it all worth it.
good,"Working at PNC was a really fun and positive environment interacting with different clients. Everyday was a different day working with different eco partners such as loan officers, business bankers, financial advisers, mortgage officer and account executives."
good,"People are generally nice to deal with, work life balance is OK, low turn-over rate, plenty of training opportunity, company culture is OK, promotion is not easy though"
good,"Enjoyed working at PNC Bank. Had pretty set schedule and office environment was nice. however, didn't like low pay and difficult to advance within your local branch."
good,"Having a good relationship with immediate managers, peers and team will make a difference . Employees get opportunities to learn and grow within the branch setting."
good,"Pay is not competitive with similar roles in other companies. Work/life balance is dependent upon your role in the company. It seems that customer facing roles are being made to work later and later. PNC does offer incentive, but it can be difficult to get. Good first job to gain professional experience."
good,"It was a wonderful company when I started at Provident National Bk, then we merged and became PNC and things changed constantly.  Sometimes not for the benefit of the employee and more geared to management.  Because of changes I was penalized for my starting age on the job for the 401k and my profit sharing balance was taken and distributed to all employees over age 40 regardless of time with the company.  My service meant nothing to the company even though I stayed 30 years.  I managed to survive 2 previous job transfers before the last in 2012.   I have heard the company has changed even more since then and not all for the better."
good,"Loved having the same people come in everyday and building that relation with them, having a strong relationship with the customer helps you to do your job better."
good,Don't expect to make a career out of your position. They will tell you what the average is for your position but it will take you 4-5 years just to hit that average
good,"Opening for bank tellers consisted of safety check with another member of staff. Opening and signing on. Depositing over night drops to business accounts. Daily activity of customers transactions. Helping clients with maintaining their accounts. "
good,PNC is a well run and focused environment. The professionals here are generally life long bankers with solid foundations. The bank is positioning itself to be a long term leader in the banking space
good,"PNC has a good work environment and offers good benefits.  However, PNC's pay is not competitive to other banks or financial institutes.  PNC does not provide acceptable pay increases or bonuses."
good,the only reason i left was because other banks offer about 4-6 dollars more doing the same things. The pay is not good there at all. i would love to work there again if they paid their employees a lot better.
good,"I enjoyed this job most of the time.  Any time working with the public can be difficult, but worked with great people. Usually worked 6 - 8 hours a day.  Worked 3 Saturdays a month.  Work days were very busy and the day went fast."
good,"Overall, a good place to work but no room to advance. Management is good and the workplace is relaxing. More job opportunities are needed, but hard to come by since parent company is located up North."
good,The Wealth Management Team hired many of us as Banking Advisors with perks to come after 6 months. Position was changed to a Support Banker with no perks.
good,"decent pay with commission but without, pay sucks. as a collector , you can make decent money, unless there are staffing issues then the department as a whole suffers."
good,Great place to work. The atmosphere is what you make it.  Will succeed by using processes In place. Incentive compensation is very fair. The culture is great as well.
good,"Hard place for a balance life. "
good,One of the lowest paying banks around. It is also far behind with technology and leveraging it to process transactions................................
good,"Very fast paced in the morning, slowed down in the afternoon to evening. Not a lot of busy work to do if you were not assisting clients. Management was come and go, lots of different managers came in and out of the branch making it difficult to adapt at times."
good,"I only worked at bank for four months before finding a full time job.  I would work for them again, however.  The training was full time for a month and prepared me well for the tasks given to !me."
good,The hardest part of the job was learning about banking. My manager was great and easy to talk to. The culture was pretty serious and quiet. The best part of the job was the experience and working downtown for the first time!
good,"Nice place to work. It has its day to day challenges, but with the right skills and support, you can pull through and accomplish the various tasks at hand."
good,PNC Bank is very focused on how to improve their clients financial well being. Making sure every avenue is taken to assure the client that the products and services being offered is in their best interest.
good,"I really enjoy the work that I do with PNC. I like working with numbers and it is fun when I'm given special things to do. You know what you have to do each day and I don't mind that. I've learned how to do the job, but most of that was self-taught. I would have liked more training. Management can be frustrating at times."
good,I can not review this company at this moment as I still hold a position at this institution. My review is neutral and experience depends on different factors.
good,PNC has been a great company to work for and is constantly changing to adapt to the new style of workforce. Work from Home options are beginning to take place more frequently.
good,"Culture is very typical chain down management but the benefits are great. Vacation and pay are good but the people at the bottom are not always treated the same as ""higher up"" positions are."
good,"I liked PNC - I didn't see much chance for advancement and they offered little benefits. There was test office moral, however, little understanding during pregnancy as far as morning sickness, etc."
good,"Banking was fun when I first started but more and more it became mostly about pushing clients into opening accounts and applying for services that were completely unneeded, simply for the fact that each employee has to reach a certain number of accounts on a monthly basis. The job is more about reaching goals and hitting certain numbers rather than actually getting to know your clients and really following them through into the directions they need to go. Many times if you didn't reach your goals at the end of the month, you would have to pull an all-nighter making phone calls to clients with a nice savings account and beg them to come in and turn some of that cash into a frozen long-term account. It was dreadful."
good,Salary so..so..Company that offers positions in most to the east coast. Fast pace environment with challenges that push you to develop and grow. Loved the clients. The challenges is the hours you may be scheduled. Enjoyable is they are about the clients financial well-being.
good,"PNC is a good company for entry level positions, and the company does encourage it's workers to advance. The key is finding good management that will help you to grow."
good,"This job duties were very simple and manageable. There was plenty of time to keep up with the compliance training and your daily work load. The management at my particular branch was not qualified for the job. The hardest part of the job, was knowing what you were going to eat for lunch and the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting all types of people. Meeting new people and helping them better understand their bank accounts and their finances."
good,"Dealing with client transactions on a daily basis, PNC bank allowed me to better understand the financial world around us. With a managements desire to promote our clients to new services and banking options, the bank has taught me to search for a customers needs and provide them various options. While dealing with client services in a professional atmosphere, this positions pushed to reverted my language in a professional matter when dealing with clients. Along with the incentive to push various products on our clients, to better serve their banking needs."
good,Love what I do so it was easy to enjoy my days at work.  it a high demand and challenging company.  i would recommend it to those who are starting in the finance career but not to experienced veterans.
good,"Loved my co-workers, decent management, low compensation, very competitive work environment. Growth opportunity, flexible schedules, free lunch and okay benefits."
good,"My typical day at work is sometimes complex depending on the clients need. However, my coworkers make the job comforting. I enjoy helping others on a daily basis and establishing a trustworthy relationship with them. My clients and my staff know I have their best interest at heart"
good,in the beginning it was great then it became like every other company that hires unqualified people for higher positions.
good,"Fast paced rewarding job, hardest part is not being able to reverse fees to customers who needed it the most. Co-workers are fun to be around a sense of family."
good,"Bonus and compesation structure needs to be more detailed. There were constant changes on it, and looks like there is not much of stability on those two things."
good,"PNC had bought out National City Bank which had done the same with Harbor Federal Savings Bank. The major challenge was conforming to a large bank system from and extremely efficient community Bank. As the system changed, so did the atmosphere of helping our customers."
good,"Great benefits and decent pay; worked in mortgage services assisting homeowners w/insurance, billing, taxes and claims"
good,"This is not a good place to stay, but if you can succeed through a year or so and then move to a better job then you are golden."
good,"For those willing to relocate, there are plenty of opportunities for advancement throughout the company. This company focuses on customer faced interactions and encourages conversations and outside promotion."
good,"PNC is a great place to work with great benefits for their employees. As with any job, the most enjoyable part is the people I've worked with."
good,Typical banking environment.  Everyone is friendly and helpful.  Getting enough time and high quality lending opportunities are becoming harder and harder.
good,Great company as far as structure goes and making you feel like they care about you individually.  The catch though is if you make one small mistake they will not hesitate you let you go.
good,The company supports and promotes work life program extremely well. I would recommend employment workiing working mom and single family households.
good,The job culture is cool & it's all about learning new products & services. Personally it fits someone who is customer oriented and willing to handle person to person interaction.
good,Enjoy working here the pay is great and good benefits and vacation time off. Fast paced environment and must be able to adapt to change.
good,The overall workplace is very nice.  Clean environment and supportive management. Colleagues are very friendly and willing to help you.  Excellent place to make contacts to move career path internally.
good,"I really enjoyed working with PNC, the coworkers I had turned into great friends and the work environment was fun and healthy. During the time I was with them my husband was deployed and everyone was very kind. I really enjoyed my customers and our conversations with them."
good,You get to meet really cool people. It's a challenging job in committing to your goals. You get to learn a lot from specific roles if you are willing to learn.
good,Would have enjoyed it better if it had been busier.  I had a wonderful manager who cared about his employees. Loved my customers
good,"PNC was an amazing place to work, I enjoyed all of my 2 years with the company. The staff members at my branch were such a great team to work with and the customers were so kind.  I really enjoyed the location in the heart of downtown DC."
good,"I really enjoyed working for PNC Bank for 13 years and was very successful working in Default Management servicing the Private Client Group.  I broke records within PNC for the collections aspect to 97%!  Almost one (1) year ago, there was a freeze put on hiring and advancement, along with Corporate Re-Organization within the Company.  My expectations in growing within the Company was at a stands still.  I was in desperate need for a Career Change."
good,Great serving job! Loved the management and other employees. Had so much fun at work. When I was there it was very short staffed. Hoping that has since been fixed
good,"I think the only thing I would change is the management because the company needs new fresh ideas."
good,This was a call center and advancement opportunities were not there.You were on the phone speaking to customers about there default mortgages and available
good,"A typical day is waiting for each market to come in on time , count the bags of work and make sure the count matches what the driver have on there manifest slip."
good,Great place to start working professionally.  Learned many different skills all the while sharpening any previous skills that I currently had.
good,"Meet all different type of people everyday with all different aspects of life. It was exciting most of the time but sometime gets stress full. Co-workers here were great people to work with, very helpful and fun."
good,This job taught me a lot about the industry and how to work with people regarding personal finances. The job expectations are clear and the company provides recognition for hard work and accomplishments.
good,"I'm part of the management team"
good,It was a very high intensity fast-paced position.   I worked in the operation center.  High volume of work.  High turnover.  Non-flexible schedule.  Management making major changes.
good,"Provides the best training for a campus fresher. Helps groom a trainee  "
good,"Very productive environment to work in with good co-workers. Greek customers as they come into the bank with good cheer.  A typical  day a work is processing checks; cash, withdraw and deposit checks. Management/co-workers are very concerned about my productivity and how I'm doing in a positive way. The hardest part of the job is making sure that everything and everyone is safe and secure. The most enjoyable part of job is making sure that the customers are satisfied with my level of service to them at the end of the day."
good,"Overall very good company, lots of perks for working for the company.  Normal work-life balance. Worked there for 9 years, mostly enjoyable learning experience."
good,"PNC offers employees great opportunities to grow individually and as a team. They are truly a good company to work for, but you have to work hard for what you want."
good,"I work in the consumer direct division which is a call center environment working on retention of current customers. You get leads from the bank portfolio to call on and attempt to refinance. There are a lot of streamline customer's available. The biggest issue is when you do your job as a group and overload processing, they will turn the rates higher and slow production down."
good,"It was an great and growing experience to work for PNC. "
good,"My management skills were not forceful and I treated my employees with respect.  I would not ask them to perform duties that I would not know and perform.  I tried to keep a friendly but business like atmosphere in my department."
good,"A typical day at PNC bank can vary from many things account openings, account closings, debit/credit card transactions, money orders, cashiers checks, international wire transfers. Garda pick-up currency orders. Also a significant amount of cash handling. "
good,"My typical day at work would include signing on to my computer and catching up on emails, news reports about the company and reviewing company policies and procedures. I've learned that teamwork is the base to all accomplishments and learning everyday makes me a be better employee. The management is encouraging with my daily work and aides where needed. My co-workers are great people, they have been in the banking industry for quite a while, so I can learn from them everyday. The hardest part of the job is taking in all the new information that the bank has to offer. The most enjoyable part of the job is the clients that visit me at the bank, they make my days a lot easier and more enjoyable."
good,good place to work nice co-workers the hardest part of the job is sitting for long periods of time.
good,"I enjoyed working for PNC Mortgage. They offer plenty of benefits. It is an integrity company that cares about the balance of family and work life. They offer assistance with adoption, school, counseling, etc."
good,"While this job was fantastic for learning and growing it is highly based on location of your branch. If you are at a slower location they create chaos by having you go out and find accounts, but they also short staff those branches so rescheduling events takes place pretty frequently."
good,"The work life balance is pretty good, but pay is well below average."
good,"I believe the introduction of the PNC Conversation has put PNC on another level. This makes it easy to communicate, uncover customer needs and to cross sell."
good,Pay isnt the greatest here and there are constant changes. But there has always been good people.
good,"typical work day 8 to 5 pm loved the hours no weekends, nice clean environment , professional, co-worker were friendly."
good,"Work with great people,"
good,PNC offers great benefits. They are one of very few companies that still offer pension
good,"Truly love what I do, but Manager has taken things to a new and worse level that it starts to get to me. I love being able to help customers and if that is what my job was suppose to be, but since the change in upper management things have changed and its now everyone is a number."
good,It is a good place to work for. My co-workers are a great group to work with
good,"A typical day would include processing night deposit bags before the branch opens to customers. Followed by a brief, 10-15 minute meeting with the staff. When the doors open you're primary job is to process customers requests for deposits or cashing checks.  As a Teller Supervisor you are also responsible for coaching the teller staff in sales and audit. Another big part of a Teller Supervisor's job is to manage the branch cash and keeping it in line with guidelines."
good,"Site was located right next to public transportation (rail). Comparable benefit package (401K, Insurance, Vacation). Onsite cafeteria. I had a great manager, who I really enjoyed working with."
good,"A typical day of work starts with me logging into all necessary programs, then checking my daily emails. I take inbound calls that have pretty much anything to do with banking products. I also sell banking products so I take applications for loans, checking, savings, etc. I also make outbound calls to customers to see if their is anything PNC can do to make their banking experience better.  I am one of the 12-15 employees that makes up a team with in the outbound Sales department. My sole supervisor is who I report too. My co-workers are great to be around they help make the job less stressful. I would say the worst part of the job is to hear people yell at you all day long for stuff that isn't your fault. The best part of the job on the other hand is making the customers feel more at ease with their banking, and leaving the phone call better off than it started."
good,Great position for just starting. Pay is not the best but the people are easy to work with. Hard for advancement based on company rules.
good,I thought this was a good place to work but I am looking to use my degrees that I have earned. Accounting and Business management.
good,"Challenging in a way that, if you're used to dealing with face-to-face customer service, and can hold your own in a diverse environment, then this workplace would be good for you.  You work in a branch and it really depends who you work with that will make or break your work experience at the bank.  Customers are very diverse in their needs and can be crazy at times.  Mostly are cooperative, but once in a while there will be instances that the bank can be confrontational."
good,"The relationship with my coworkers are amazing. We get along very well and have a bond that I have never had at a previous job. We laugh and have a good time, the pay could be better."
good,"Working in the corporate sector of the company, one would assume daily activities are routine since I am not working directly with the public.  That could not be further from the truth.  I could plan what I am going to do the next day, but one email can take me off track and even take up half of my days work.  I do not mind it though.  I love being busy and learning daily.  That takes me to what I have learned about myself as an individual and an employee."
good,Enjoyable and a lesson learn. Not a lot of support very one sided. i can say that i have learn some important facts abot working
good,"Working to build a pipeline of loans through development of real estate agent contacts, attorney and all entities of the mortgage industry.  Joined numerous clubs, organizations to help increase that base for the origination of mortage loans."
good,A typical day starts by opening my email and seeing new request from clients and/or partners from another line of business. Attending meetings to optimize work production and to learn about new processes. Management does not micro manage which enables everyone to be independent. The hardest part of the job sometimes is following all the procedures to complete simple task of the red tape was not there. The most enjoyable part is the coworkers.
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my time with the company, however, the technology was lacking."
good,Good company to work for. Little career growth opportunities and the pay is not very competitive
good,"PNC is a great place to work with a lot of great people, however the pay is far from impressive."
good,The job is hard and can be tiresome. What makes up for that is we have a great team to work with.
good,"I was responsible for managing, training, directing, and coordinating activities for a 7000 call per month call center in the Operations department, My position required heavy interaction with all departments of the bank not only in operations, but with the corporate banking department as well. I was also responsible for maintaining a budget, and meeting the financial plan for the department. I worked heavily with the marketing department to assist in sales and to maintain current client relationships. I loved this job because it allowed me to work with so many different departments of the bank and with so many people with diverse backgrounds and skill sets within their job function. I was required to put in long hours, and did take work home. I enjoyed managing people, I liked getting to know them and assigning projects that matched their skills sets, that kept morale high and let them feel a part of what the unit represented. The pros were much more than the cons with this job."
good,I learned everything about banking products and services. The hardest part of the job was that managers were always breathing down your throat for customer service even when you are in a sales role.
good,"My job was mostly Data entry. I would start my morning off by running reports and also doing the swift reconciliation from other countries. I would look over imports and exports and make sure our customers had the correcxt legal documentation to proceed with their transactions. Management was great! They helped you in any way they could, and they made the work day easier. My co-workers were well-rounded team players. They never hesitated to help when I needed it. The hardest part about my job was making sure I didn't make any mistakes. If I did, a customers transaction might not go through for the day, and that wouldn't look good for my company. The most enjoyable part of my day was being with my co-workers and learning from them."
good,"A typical day at work entails non-stop phone calls from borrowers, I've learned about the mortgage industry through customer service because all calls are generated through customer service. Management is present but not very connected to actually working on the phone. My co-workers are great from what I can recall because we have very little time to interact with one another. The hardest part of this job is not being able to have a full lunch hour. The most enjoyable part of the job is some of the people you meet on the phone. Some times you encounter nice people that your really make your day."
good,PNC had a moderate work pace but I always found that I had something to do the entire day which was great. I really enjoyed my time working with my fellow employees at PNC.
good,"I had an assigned que of Home Equity loans that I worked start to finish. Calling customers for missing information, advising of appraisals turn around time. Finally, calling branches and customers to set up loan closings."
good,Great company...great benefits. I worked on the investment side and the retail investment management team is not very talented. Typical tactics to micro manage sales goals.
good,"I was rewarded by the relationship I built with my customers. I had been at the same location for many years and I knew my customers on a level in which they had built trust in my opinions. Many would wait until I was available and I learned a great deal about them. I focused alot on learning a great deal about our products and services in order to do things right for my customer the first time. The hardest part of my job was referrals. Most of our customers were repeat customers, in the branch more than twice per week, they had everything that they needed. I enjoyed my team and we worked well together to accomplish daily task. My manager had alot of experience and when she had the time to focus, I learned alot from her. Many things that I learned I took personal responsibility for, and helped my team stay updated on new procedures and policies that I had noticed. It was difficult to be promoted within the company due to large turnover on the teller line and lack of support from manager and supervisor."
good,"The department was divided because at the time system conversions were being made. Those of us that were hired under the old system were required to do all of the unconverted clients work no matter what then help others with the converted system. But If the new system users completed work they were sent home, and never assist in completing the old work.I Learned if you were the bosses favorite you worked less. The managers were helpful except my direct manager was a bit immature, and would literally run and hide behind our desks to escape his BOSS (The site Manager) on the production floor.The Job was simple and not hard at all"
good,Fair benefits/compensation but mixed direction for advancement.
good,"A typical day at work was doing different types of transactions, like deposits, withdrawal, cashiers checks, account maintenance etc.,"
good,"Company will give you a chance to grow with avarage of working compansation , be ready not to have your persinal life."
good,I only worked for PNC for 17 days due to my position being eliminated with the purchase or RBC Bank. PNC treated displaced employees with great respect.
good,PNC Bank was a great place to work. It had good hours and management in place. The East Charlotte Site grew rapidly and I progressed quickly. The downside is that the site closed after i had been there for about a year.
good,"PNC is a great place to start, if you would like to grown in the financial feild. This is also place to start when you frist get out of college. They also have great things for people that would like to go back to college."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company, the CEO, is an outstanding mand and the company cares about children and does great things through Grow Up Great"
good,"The overall environment of PNC is pretty laid back, but sometimes meeting numbers along with all other responsibilities can seem impossible and quite stressful, especially when they keep changing or adding more and more! "
good,If I had the necessary management support from beginning I feel I would not have been unfairly downgraded. Insurance is great and there are several benefits but now incentives will be discontinued and pay will increase more
good,"As mentioned, Production based with support and many partners available for continued support. A great company to work for with attractive incentives."
good,"Work is only fun if the team is engaged which makes the customers engaged, which in turn gets you more excited to do your job = More Money = Hopefully all customers give you 5 star reviews! = If you get anything lower, you Bonus disappears = Trash. "
good,"Varies"
good,"•	Analyzed varied and complex transactions/processes utilizing standard and non-standard procedures."
good,"Through my experiences at PNC, I've had the opportunity to be a part of a thriving company in a heavily regulated industry. The growth opportunities, however, are usually awarded to younger, less seasoned employees and the salary increases are minimal within the cost side of the organization. The revenue-generating lines of business offer more opportunities."
good,For the most part my job was good.  When I needed some questions answered I sometimes had a hard time finding the answer.  My manager had too many employees to be able to help all.  The hardest part of the job is the differences in the departments.  There is no cooperation within the departments at times.
good,Good company workplace experience and employee benefit options. Solid support network and access to resources. Strong customer service and customer care platform.
good,"Solid company, provides good suite of products for the clients.  Trouble with keeping bankers engaged and had a high turnover rate for both bankers and managers."
good,"Their theory of business culture was great, however, the requirements per person were not reasonable for the time alotted to complete, and compensation did not support the job requirements & the amount of time needed to do what was required."
good,Some of the managers at PNC encourage continuing education. Satisfying the customer is always number one. Working with an eclectic group of co-workers is exciting. Diversity training is one of the best I have seen corporately.
good,"PNC has 6 weeks paid parental leave for all new parents. Health insurance is about average to what is out there, 401k match and a pension are nice, but overall salary is lacking competitiveness for similar jobs. "
good,"/As a leader of one of the larger City locations my daily responsibilities consist of leading my Team in sales results, cash management, proficiency in operations, coaching and developing & Human Resources."
good,I've learned to Work faster on the computer. The hardest part of the job is trying to keep all the customers satisfied. Easiest is giving them ways to be more established financially
good,"PNC is a company that provides a lot of opportunity for growth, learning new things and they compensate well in comparison to others in the same market. Pros: good pay, solid benefits, room for growth, excellent training. Cons: management needs improvement, development plans are lacking, culture can be a bit liberal and difficult to navigate."
good,"Just stay on their good side and out of trouble and you will succeed. Follow the rules, and do as you are specifically told. A good place to work otherwise"
good,"Everything is monitored. phone calls, computer activity, email activity, every minute detail. Understandable to a point - but daunting none-the-less..."
good,"Great company, but the structure of the company is constantly changing. The policies and procedures change with each loan. The management team is easy to work with & the staff is very pleasant."
good,"I hadn't worked there in many years, but from personal experience and the type of position I held, I did enjoy the work and the people/managers I had around me."
good,"They don't allow employees to grow within the company unless you've been there for at least two years, no matter how well you exceed in the position you were currently in."
good,"PNC is a great company to work for. It's difficult to get a job there, because they expect greatness. They offer great benefit options. My management team was great, however, one of my coworkers caused a toxic, very threatening work environment. HR was unable to come to a resolution where I would feel safe coming to work everyday. So, I was forced to resign."
good,"All employees start at a minimum of $15/hr. Paid on-site training. Opportunity to work from home. Option to have a split shift. Pays shift differential for shifts beginning after 11am. There is a transition phase where you are limited on time off, overtime, shift preferences, etc. After transition, 15 vacation days+ 1 personal /yr. but is pro-rated first year depending on hire date. Option to purchase additional vacation after 2 yrs. Opportunity to earn up to $850 in performance based incentives monthly. Plenty of opportunity for overtime. Must meet minimum quality assurance metrics. "
good,"Ability to work from home provides flexibility. When providing support to customers, the ability to support from any location makes sense and is beneficial to all involved."
good,"Management culture differs between departments and divisions. Big emphasis in TCOE to outsource all possible positions. After 22 years of service and survival of three acquisitions and one previous outsourcing of entire location in Kalamazoo, Michigan I needed to relocate to be close to my immediate family."
good,"Over all good place to work. Offers a good place to eat and lovely landscape, Good people, not too much chance to get to know anyone due to heavy call flow"
good,Typical day at work consists of analyzing customers financial data to qualify them for a loan modification or help with a short sale. Management style is hands off and the workplace culture can be stressful at times but rewarding when you are able to help a customer retain their home or close the short sale for them.
good,"good friendly work culture, most jobs are rewarding and flexible. Some of the entry level jobs are micro managed. It has been difficult to transfer to a equal level job once laid off."
good,"I enjoy working for PNC. I have gain a lot of knowledge in banking and process improvement. They offer a lot of great benefits overall. However, more action need to be taken when handling advancement and job placement."
good,"Great benefits, unreasonable goals, normal work week 40+ hours, outside business development required, management is aggressive and older, culture of coaching,  job is very stressful"
good,I enjoyed my time with PNC.  It is a well established bank where the company is not in a constant state of reorganization. Roles are well defined and management has a clear direction and expectation.
good,If you are looking for a long career with the ability to grow within the same company than PNC is the place for you. great benefits and great vacation time. just be aware there is a lot of turn over in the branch setting and you will get new coworkers often. for sure a sales environment. be prepared to meet certain behavior based goals.
good,"During my time there I was seemingly being groomed for a FT requisition.  Once it was evident the ""Application Manager"" determined I was aligned with a ""Troubled"" employee, I was ""lumped"" in with that employee and after being extended 3 times on a contract, and told there was a requisition for which I was earmarked, ultimately my contract was ended due to ""budget""."
good,"i love my job, but it seems so far my opportunity to grow and i spend more money going to work and parking that what i get paid. Even that i work with a good team i need to cover my personal finance needs."
good,"Very good structure of rules and procedures.  Training is excellent.  On going education is excellent.  Sales goals are unreasonable.  Customer service goals are priority, but sales pressure contradicts the service."
good,It's okay working there. It would be nice to receive more money for what we do. The culture is nice. The benefits are nice. I like the supervisors there.
good,"professionally grow up here. learn about new field. WE are using  a six flag system, doing every month a new field by "" my learning "" classes on line. grow professionally every day."
good,"Great place in terms of values, still needs to catch up to the future. Some culture still resilient from 80;s and 90's, despite company growth."
good,I worked at this bank over 18 years ago. So my experience is a lot different that it would be today. I enjoyed working there. I just got caught up in the downsizing movement
good,I was nice working experience in PNC. Good work culture and facilities available at every PNC office location. Good learning opportunities available there.
good,"Managed a team of 6 Administrators responsible for managing 401K accounts for Plan Sponsors by maintaining plan documents monitoring regulatory filings, plan compliance testing and any necessary processing all participant activity.  The management team was great, we worked well together, unfortunately our positions were relocated to Pittsburgh."
good,"PNC is definitely a super regional bank."
good,"There are pluses and minuses to working at PNC.  Positives - flex schedule and work from home, Negative - heavy outsourcing with sub-par quality workers, heavy process, and slow to implement."
good,Overall people are good to work with.  A lot of red tape to get jobs accomplished.  Impossible to get raise.  Overall seem to take care of employees for long term.  A lot of 20 year and longer employees.
good,"I loved working at PNC Financial Services.  Excellent executive management.  Good management training available and required.  Good place to develop your career. Collaborative, fun, hard working environment"
good,"Overall I believe PNC is very demanding when it comes to goals. Having works at a location that eventually turned into a ""Business Banking branch"" the goals doubled and sometimes seemed impossible to achieve. Working for the company was great, I met a lot of great people, most of my co-workers were wonderful, it cam just be a very  stressful job."
good,"Project was beyond deadline prior to start date, thus making the entire project stressful.  Project Business PMO was not organized for this particular project in a fashion that would lend assistance to a Consultant coming in to 'save the day'."
good,"A typical day at PNCBank was usually busy but fun at the same time.  I enjoyed my co workers, management and the customers.  I learned that if you want to move ahead in life you have to work for it.  The hardest part of this bank was trying to sell products at the teller windows.  It was possible but time limits you.  Other customers wanted to do their banking and leave.  I enjoyed it because we would always have snacks and goodies at our windows."
good,"Company overall is good but do not pay competitively. My last manager was the worst I have ever had in my life. Unorganized, unprofessional and in experienced."
good,I was only with PNC for a short time as I was laid off after they bought out National City Bank.  National City was a wonderful company to work for and I miss the company greatly
good,"I like where I work, just wish the pay was better. I would like more details as it relates to training its almost not available at PNC. Its needs to be"
good,"A day at PNC starts early at 7."
good,"The corporate culture was laid back and easy going. The stress level was minimal, but the opportunity for advancement was also minimal. The work was very repetitive and after sometime began to be less and less engaging."
good,Great to get your foot in the door to banking but the salary is lower than competitors.  The bonuses are a tad better but they are taxed so heavily that it doesn't feel as worth it.
good,"Excellent company to work for."
good,"Work Life balance is wonderful at this company! The benefits are great and the environment itself is relaxed, dress code is business casual. Are making strides in improving areas within the benefits"
good,The people in my group were great and helpful. The company as a whole was slow to get things started and even slower to finish the project. Working from home was a bonus and was nice in cold weather not to have to go outside.
good,Hard work fair pay. No obvious path for advancement. Work was very demanding but rewarding. Genuine appreciation was recieved from managers on all projects.
good,This is a stressful place to work but can achieve goal with practice and learning. As I just started working here so it is too early to comment on other aspects.
good,"PNC is a great place to work! My manager was very supportive in everything, however many times the regional management liked to micro manage! It also seemed like they wanted us to work six days a week but still within the 40hrs!"
good,"Overall it's a good place to work with decent benefits. Most roles are low-stress. The biggest draw back is there no career advancement unless you know someone. "
good,"Working with PNC I was encouraged to learn as much as possible. they cultivate talent and as long as you qualify and are a motivated person who is willing to move in different positions they will train and encourage you to move forward. Work days typical start at 8:30 and end at 5:15 unless for extenuating circumstances. upper management is good minimal micro management. hardest part of the job would be the customers at times and the employees on other occasions. I Assisted clients with achieving their financial goals or coming up with a plan of action to get to that goal. Maintaining the internal goals for the branch and the individuals is high priority, rallying the team is a must and keeping everyone motivated is key"
good,"Being a collections specialist meant you had to be on the phone 90% of the time, making calls and trying to collect customer's debt. I was lucky and had good supervisors, however supervisors don't have a lot of control on what happens because their bosses make those decisions.  Hourly pay was okay, but once commissions changed it was a lot harder to make the same amount as before.  Customers can get pretty upset over the phone (which can be understandable), however I was taught on what to say and how to approach calls differently.  As frustrating as the job could be, it was a fun environment most of the time."
good,"PNC is a great bank and a decent place to work. The power and best job opportunities are in Pittsburgh. The days were busy but too much like the Audit Dept, who the department answered to."
good,"I took inbound calls from customers whom wanted to know their balance, see if a check or card payment went through their accounts, I assisted with upselling overdraft products to customers whom accounts were overdrawn. I ordered checks and debit cards, helped in locating a local ATM near their location. I participated in their program that assisted blind callers in the use of an ATM machine. I assisted in the training of the new hire financial service consultants, I also did take escalated calls from customers whom needed to speak with a supervisor when a supervisor might not be available."
good,"I worked in a small town branch where I had the pleasure of getting to know all of my regular customers very well. The team I worked with here was very supportive and morale was always high. Even through a merger with another bank. "
good,"I worked here for 10 years.  I began as a receptionist and ended as a paralegal in ERISA compliance.  Overall the Bank was a very good place to work.  It provided a reasonable compensation partnered with a very nice benefits package.  Save only one, my immediate supervising managers were exceptional and very responsive to my work place needs.  I became one of the ""casualties"" in a Bank wide downsizing."
good,I have received a tremendous work from home/office balance that has helped me to maintain work/life balance.  This is likely not possible in all departments but definitely exists within the company.
good,I enjoyed working with PNC. It was a full time position and always something productive that needed to be done. I was able to learn different departments and assist where needed. I learned great organization and prioritizing skills.
good,A typical day at work for me is withdrawing and depositing money for customers. Handling very large amounts of money throughout the day. The hardest part of the day is the customers always.
good,"If you make it fun and interesting, it will be that way. You have to take your career in your hands. Nothing is given and much is required and expected."
good,"Overall good work environment but the pay was not NEARLY enough to compensate for the workload, which typically (for most positions) was enough for 2 to 3 people."
good,I enjoyed working at PNC.  Worked with a lot of good people.  Unfortunately I was only a contractor and my contract ended.  I wish that I could have been hired on as a full time employee.  I know I would have stayed with them for as long as possible.
good,"Working for PNC gives you a lot of opportunity for internal advancement and helps you diversify your skills and experience.  Also, they have offices in several states so you can move around the country within the job."
good,"Working at PNC bank is just like working at any other commercial financial institution; fast, high energy, interacting with customers, making referrals and knowing the company's products and service seeing that the teller is basically the face of the business."
good,"Work/life balance was great. Enjoyable atmosphere, and a great way to network with regular customers. I worked on both the teller side and the banking side of the branch, and enjoyed both aspects of branch banking."
good,"Learned about Real Estate, Appraisals and Evaluations. Entered information regarding properties. Review pictures of properties when applying for HEIL or HELOC"
good,"Grows branch revenue through acquisition and share-of-wallet growth of consumer and business households."
good,"Management style changes with every new manager, some good and some terrible. I enjoyed the diversity of customers and employees.  I think the hardest part of the job was when customers would get upset when asked for their ID.  We only ask to help prevent identity fraud, so it is a protection we are trying to provide."
good,"A good place to work. A licensed financial specialist (FS) has a moderate base pay, but with the capacity to earn more than their base pay (via quarterly incentive bonuses). Unfortunately, the FS position is being eliminated across PNC's entire footprint, effective April 2017."
good,PNC has flexible work arrangements and benefits are OK.  It is hard to move up in the company as promotion from within has become rare.
good,"Although I had worked for PNC for 20+ years I was never sure if I was going to have my job tomorrow.  Management took one tiny mistake and made it into a monumental ordeal.  Although I was not fired I felt like a tiny mistake after 20 years was counted against me.  I worked very hard, I was a very good employee but one small error is more important to them than long-term loyalty and hard work"
good,Overall a good place to work with a fairly diverse group of employees. Management seems to care about their employees and is always willing to listen to new ideas.
good,"It's a good working environment. You learn so much, but promotion within is very difficult to achieve. You would have to know someone that can help pull strings to be given a shot. They give high hopes of reaching it and never commit to giving you a chance to prove yourself."
good,asset based lending is always challenging and rewarding. No two days are the same.  Multicurrency is added a special twist to lending in abl
good,"I managed 5 people on the teller line.  I would start at 8 am and review the ATM cash balance and adjust accordingly.  I would complete schedules for the tellers.  I would also complete the training for new tellers which began at corporate in a classroom environment.  I was in charge of all the operations in the branch which included ordering cash and cash supplies, rectifying customer issues, completing weekly schedules, and balancing the branch's on hand cash.  When one of the teller's vaults came up short $20,000, a full investigation proceeded from which management decided that I was not trained well enough for my job and I was demoted to a teller.  At that point, I wasn't making enough money to live and I had to leave.  I enjoyed seeing the same customers and developing a good relationship with them.  I didn't enjoy seeing the deceit among employees which included suspicion or thievery as well as jealousy of pay grade and positions in the company."
good,"> Process Bank Transactions "
good,"Very professional environment, very competent colleagues, great customers. I learnt a lot about the challenges of working in a retail banking environment. the hardest part of the job is achieving your goals flawlessly. the most enjoyable part is the compensation and interaction with some colleagues."
good,"There was opportunity to grow especially if you are willing to relocate."
good,Interesting people to work with.Too much of Hispanic orientation in my branch.PNC need to expand its customer base. Learn t a lot about financing.
good,"Good company for which to work.  Going through some changes but overall a good experience."
good,"Surrounded by high-quality talent, which is a great environment for personal development. Talent development processes are robust and detailed. Career progress is ok, Internal mobility program affords great exposure across all- markets."
good,"The branch I am located is very busy, you're constantly learning with training, co-workers are great, you deal with a lot of customers on a daily basis sometimes you can only feel you don't even get paid enough. It can be a very stressful job."
good,"My typical day at PNC would include checking email, pulling investment review information, pulling investment performance information.  We have several different programs that we use and I have thorough of all.  "
good,"This was a great place to work at, however you would have to jump through hoops getting software you needed. The bad thing about PNC was that I had to frequently travel to Pittsburgh."
good,"PNC bank is a very nice place to work, there goals are reasonable and management are very supportive by helping us succeed with our career at PNC."
good,Great company with good career opportunities (if you are in the correct location). The company seems to continually change focuses and it is tough to make long term plans because there are continual changes in management with new directives.
good,"great place to work. Hours are horrible. great team. GREAT manager. really easy to learn and stay productive."
good,"Working here I have learned all of the bank regulations."
good,"A typical day at the branch level consists of outbound calling, assisting clients with their financial needs and issues. Furthermore, daily reports and reporting of numbers is a requirement as well. It is absolutely vital to be able to work with your team members and other partners throughout PNC. The hardest part of the job to me is that there is hardly any advancement to other areas of interest. The most enjoyable part of my job is to be able to help clients, provide sound financial recommendations as well as getting to know your clients"
good,"Overall it's a great company to work for. It has a very professional atmosphere but is also a fun environment because of the group of people I work with. Everyone is very social which is a huge part of the job. The company encourages its employees to grow not only professionally, but as a person overall too. I have learned a tremendous amount about managing money over the four years that I have worked there."
good,"Cool Place to work, Great benefits, Satisfaction gained from helping people save their homes from foreclosure. The job can be stressful at times when volumes are high and deadlines are near.Co worker are pretty cool."
good,"If the branch manager is good, then PNC is a great place to work. If he/she is a poor manager, it's a miserable place. The benefits are top of the line for that pay grade."
good,"It was good experience , I was hired for a short 6 month job as a contractor.My job wast to upgrade there existing database cluster environment to higher version. I have no complains with co-workers or Management , I found all of them helpful."
good,"typical day consists of lobby management,engaging people in the aisles of the supermarket, providing customers with the knowledge about different products and services"
good,Pnc has a great staff to work with. They work hard together as a teamn and help each with the branch goals. I enjoy the moring meets and the wards and recongion.
good,"Geat work environment, managment and co workers. I learned a lot about the value of your customers. I had a great work life balance."
good,"Great hours and excellent co-workers but the hardest thing about working at PNC is there gray area in policies and procedures. One PNC Bank will allow things to slide while others wont. Over all, PNC is a very good company and cares about its associates but can be lost when your faced with contradictions."
good,PNC is a very good company to work for. The people in general are what makes the company what it is today. They have a big focus on developing younger talent.
good,"The position I held was a call center environment and consisted of making outbound calls and intercepting inbound calls from customers and authorized personnel in order to assist with applying for loss mitigation, discuss loss mitigation options, process mortgage payments, discuss or explain needed documentation, and/or to begin foreclosure proceedings. I learned various databases and strengthened my organization and prioritization skills. I working with management on special projects and assisted with the training of new employees and/or the re-training of seasoned employees. The co-workers are wonderful and are from various life types which I throughly enjoyed. The hardest part of the job was declining modification assistance to customers but the most rewarding part was being able to offer modification assistance."
good,You will meet a wide variety of people from co-workers to clients. If banking is your passion then this could be the place for you.
good,"Working at PNC has many Pros/Cons like any company.. I must say that this company has a lot of ""micromanagement"" which can make its employees uncomfortable as well as no flexibility with a work/school/personal life balance.. but they offer a lot of benefits."
good,"Best company to work for. Great stuff, co-worker were great to work with."
good,"While initially being at an entry level position i assisted Sr. BA in JAD and JAR sessions, Helped in documenting BRD at high level, also learnt development of FRD through the various stages of SDLC."
good,Standing on your feet helping multiple customers.  Management was fair and understanding. The pay was very low for the expectations of the job
good,"A typical day would begin with a department meeting to discuss the day's work for each member of the team. Management would share any expectations or changes that they had for the day."
good,"On a typical day at PNC we open the drive thru at 8am after doing Morning procedures. Then on certain days we are busy than others but on non busy days we do side work like fill deposit and withdrawl tickets and go over product. "
good,While working here I have had the opportunity to not only grow within my career but also with my personality.  I have enjoyed all of the opportunites and the team environment I work in on a day to day basis.
good,I worked in foreclosure and learned a lot about the foreclosure process.  I enjoyed my position and enjoyed working for the company itself.  At one time management was fair but they are becoming more micromanaged and I don't care for that.  PNC is a good company to work for.  The problem is with their management teams.
good,I certify new accounts coming into the bank from all PNC branch locations around the USA.  I work with OFAC on all foreign customers coming into the USA opening bank accounts to assure they have all the proper i.d. that is required by government policies.
good,"On a typical day at work, as a teller, will be processing customer's transactions, resolving customer issues and requests, and anything you cannot resolve you escalate it to the platform representatives. As a teller in PNC Bank I have learned that as long as you do your job well and right at all times and go far and beyond what is expected of you, you can advance fairly quickly within PNC as long as you have the drive and will to move forward and better yourself. Management is there to help you move forward when needed, helps you answer questions that you may have, and much more. My co-workers are the best, we work well together and get things done effectively and efficiently.  The hardest part of this job is making sure to balance to the penny at the end of the day, to make your goals on the daily basis which is 1.5% of the transactions you make a day, and to always give your 100 percent customer service to all and every client and non-client that walks through that door. All in all, I enjoy my job and the people I work with; however, I personally have outgrown this job field and is seeking a different career path."
good,"We have a great team. Everything is done wright the first time, customers are satisfied and sales goals are met do to the team work."
good,Fast paced environment. Professional. Great support functions to Talent Management team. Technology focused. Enjoyed working with the managers I supported.
good,Greta place to work with lots of coaching and advancements on the job
good,Bank has a very consevative approach that demographically does not work for everyone.
good,"PNC Financial Services group is a American Financial Services Corporation. PNC operations include a regional banking franchise operating primarily in nineteen States and the District of Columbia, specialized financial businesses serving companies and government entities, and asset management and processing businesses."
good,"overall great place, everything is always changing and can be frustrating at times"
good,"Overall, PNC is a great place to work.  I have advanced very quickly with the bank.  The job has become very stressful due to the lack of staff and support. I have the best clients and love to take care of them and thier financial needs.  They keep a smile on my face."
good,"I cross several different areas of the bank, retail, Business banking, wealth management. I manage a book of business of affluent clients that average above 125,000 in annual income. I also manage investment clients up to 1 million in assets. I am the point person for these clients and make sure that any need, personal or business, is taken care of from beginning to end. My days are full."
good,I really enjoyed working for this company.  It is a great company to work for.
good,PNC overall is a good company to work for. It is not a job for a person who needs flexibility.
good,Most enjoyable part of the job are you PNC BANK customers.Although the job does require you to push products that may or may not fit every customer.
good,My work day typically involves financial reporting and analysis related to my line of business within the bank.  This involves database research as well as regular and open commnications with colleagues and segment partners.  Any downtime leaves the opportunity to explore avenues of development such as various trainings and/or presentations offered by the bank.  The most enjoyable part of the job is that it is easy to come across and learn something new all the time.  It hepls to be able to stay abreast of the constant changes in the industry.
good,"Attend meeting and write requirement for system."
good,"I worked in the production control department dealing with HAMP; which was Customer Advocacy before then, but that department got dismantled. My typical day I ordered credit reports, AVM's, broker's price opinions, conducted audits for treasury, monitored trial payments, released foreclosure holds, monitored seven and 30 day certifications for foreclosure and many other tasks. "
good,they will drain every ounce from you. work more hours than the bank is open
good,Answering the calls of customers assisting them with banking needs and serving them with the friendliest and most accurate help as possible.
good,The management in the mortgage division is not on par with the bank itself. The mortgage division is still trying to develop an identity and constantly is reinventing the processes which creates the disorganization that follows new implementation. The mid level management has no origination experience and so does not fuilly understand origination outside of the bank referrals. Good people with good intentions. I hope they get it right.
good,"Manages customer portfolios, maintain establish professional rapport, cross-sells all products and services.  Provides broad base of financial and credit services with the goals of acquiring 100% of the customer’s business. "
good,"Great company to work for, team work and outreach in the community are key winning points and why this bank is successful as a whole"
good,"A typical day of work would consist of taking incoming calls from customer's and helping them with there checking and savings accounts. After I serviced the customer, I would engage in conversation to see what products and services with the customer that would best suit their needs.

good,Enjoyable atmosphere for work and great team work. Provides good banking services.
good,"PNC is a great place to be if you work in one of the faster branches. If you find yourself in a slow paced branch you will want to tear out your own hair. You'll be lucky to see 5 people a day in the branch, and still be expected to meet all sales goals (which are you uniform across the PNC market no matter how busy or not busy you are). Expected to make 20 cold calls calls a day."
good,"I worked as a Processing Teller for 3 years. I opened mail, processed the statements or other correspondence and processed any checks that were included. I have worked with several different types of machines that either processed the correspondence or the checks. I have 6 years of ten key experience. I also worked as a Process Improvement Analysis for 4 years, but stepped back down to Processing Teller when the company was purchased. As a Processing Improvement Analyst, I did daily audit on production, co-workers or new processes.Our team was in charge of finding, correcting and attempting to eliminate errors for our department. I was completely in charge of a new process from beginning to end. Unfortunately the company decided not to proceed due to cost. I had many friends in management and on the processing floor. The hardest part of my job is due to my lack of education I struggled with some areas of my job, because I do not have the knowledge in computers that I would like to have. What I liked about my job is that even though there were certain things I did every day. There was always a new work experience around the corner. I learned many things from this job and I think it took the best of my talents and put them to the best use for the company."
good,"a typical work day is similar to most  consistently learning something new. My team was very very productive and easy to get along with. The most difficult portion of my job is the constant turn over rate and drastic increase of responsibility. the most enjoyable part of my job is just knowing that because of  me, I was able to help and make someones day. "
good,"While PNC is listed as a great place to work by multiple publications, individual experiences will vary by department.  Some groups allow flexible work arrangements, while others offer very littel work/life balance. Additionally, some departments offer very little in way of career development and/or advancement. "
good,"PNC has given me a chance to grow and prove my skills in a ""green environment"".  People are very friendly, great company to work for with many great benefits."
good,Its a good place to work. I have learned more of a direct marketing approach. The company that prides in the community it serves. Management varies per location. Coworkers are fun and is supportive by a strong team-working atmosphere. Hardest part of the job is reaching a bonus levels that are worth the handwork.
good,"During a typical day at work I would be opening Trust Accounts, IMA's and IRA's for high net worth individuals and entities. I use my knowledge of policy and procedures to get the accounts open according to standards set by the law and the company."
good,"Typical day would usually be between 8-10hrs of work. I worked with amazing, down to earth co-workers who were easy to talk to and work with. The hardest part of the job was working with our system because they were so out-dated. The most enjoyable part of the job was receiving the pay check."
good,I handled elevated calls from people when they were upset and asking for a supervisor.
good,Typical day would be getting to work and getting your cash drawer set up and preparing for the rush of customers. The hardest part of the day was dealing with angry customers that were regulars and if you are a new employee they expect the same exceptions that the other employees give these customers.
good,"On a typical day it was very busy,by the end of the day i could end up taking 800-1,000 calls. I did learn alot abt the products they had and what to ed cust and waht products what fit there banking needs. There were time when we had to switch teams but during the time we did work together we worked well together by encourageing one another waht goals was needed to be met to get their bounus for that quarter.the hardest was cust that was able to be helped at that initial call and had to be transfered to a sup, reaching goal for th bonus and employee appreciation day was enjoyable"
good,Enjoy going to work everyday which each day is different. Making sure all customer accounts deadlines are met. I filled in whenever we were short handed besides doing my supervisor duties.
good,"If you are able to maintain hours of repetitive movement and work, employment at a PNC Lockbox is a move in the right direction for you. There are different parts of the working body that makes a lockbox function successfully and they all require a steady and concentrated mindset. This job is volume driven meaning that, the more you do, the better it is. However, you are penalized by your errors in terms of monetary value. This position is very detail orientated, which means every detail counts and every mistake hurts."
good,"PNC bought RBC, my position was displaced, they would be a good company to work for."
good,One of the best training programs in the country-- includes 6 weeks of credit training and other 1-week trainings throughout the first two years.
good,"A typical day at this job was contact with customers concerning their accts, lost checks, no signatures, no deposit slips, no address or acct number on ATM deposits. I was also responsible for a number of administrative duties, phones, data entry ect."
good,Branch is a very busy branch where we are customer friendly always. We always make our customers feel special. We are required to cross sell products on a daily basis .Management is always available to coach and help in any issues.We work as a team with all the co workers.Best part of my day is being able to help a customer with any concerns. Hardest part of my job having to be on my feet all day.
good,Pulled files from mainframe and ran through a internal program for processing.
good,"Fast paced department. Which is deadline and detailed oriented. Immediate VP Manager and Instrutor are always show their appreciation. Remaining patient, uplifting and positive. It was an amazing experience working by their side. The most enjoyable part is problem solving and learning different ways to conquer and balance issues.  Also providing exceptional customer service. And being challenged mentally meant everything."
good,"Comfortable work environment."
good,"Exciting people to work with "
good,"Great work environment with flexible work arrangements. Pay could be more competitive. My job is seemingly quite secure, but I do see other ""production environment"" departments ebb and flow with personnel as the market determines. ."
good,"The people at PNC are a reason to stay. I felt my team truly cared about me as a person and wanted to see me succeed. The office space was comfortable and made it easy to get work done. HR has policies in place they made it difficult to advance financially or by title, but aside from that I think it is a great company to work for."
good,The thing that got me hooked right away was the team and family atmosphere. Their goal is to coach you up and not down. They push you to be the best you can be on a daily! That’s why I am still there
good,"Good company where you can use your experiences to venture out and try different parts of the company. You get out what you put in. Lots of well established, nice co-workers to help you progress through your career."
good,"There are a diverse area of focus, it depends on what your expertise is, or where you would like to enhance and further your career. It does take a particular individual who enjoys a call center atmosphere, talking and making a surplus of outbound calls."
good,"Lots of flexibility in schedule; great work like balance. Good benefit options, lots of vacation and sick time offered. Much, much less busy than an accountant at a public firm would be."
good,"Good company to work for, excellent benefits package. Work/life balance extremely important. Great inclusive culture. Good training program to set you up for success."
good,Working in a fast-paced environment while providing an outstanding customer experience was the most enjoyable part of my job.  I also enjoy working with the staff on their development plans to assist with potential advancement.
good,"I had a very good experience at PNC for 15 years.  Management has changed a bit, and become more metrics focused rather than people focused, but my experience was good."
good,PNC was one of the jobs that helped me so much to grow as a BA because of its work ethic and continuous strive to succeed and gie the best to customer needs. They also treat their employees nicely .
good,Getting started and learning all the products also it’s really sales driven so expect to hit numbers on a daily basis job can be really good depending on manager
good,It was a great job however other banks offered more for the same positions. Other then that the culture there was awsome. I learned so much working there.
good,"A typical day at work can vary. Some days are busier. Some days are slower. Management cares not only about business, but also about you as an employee."
good,PNC is a great place to work however staffing is extremely thin which does not allow for a proper work life balance.  PNC has been a good place to take advantage of opportunities to expand skills.
good,"Good place to work in ...stressful area to work in for those who worked with customer service...to little concern about it."
good,"The problem with most large corporations is that you only as good as the people above you and if you have bad local management making poor decisions, effects the hiring and quality of workers which in turn diminishes the ability to do your job correctly."
good,"The bank has built a culture of small bank homely feeling, while able to be competitive with the bigger banks.  Florida does differ from the other PNC Market, while its a newer market; it has excel at rapid rate."
good,Solid organization.   Going through some system changes right now.  I would recommend to individuals looking to grow within the banking world.  You can move around fairly easily if you are in the lower level positions.
good,you handle a lot of money and deal with a lot of customers face to face as well as help introduce new accounts to the client as well as handle all of their banking needs while keeping a good attitude.
good,"PNC was my first real job. My manager took a shot with me. The company is very sales oriented and focused on the incentive plan verses the actual salary. They provide great training to their employees , but managers it’s kind of figure it out as you go."
good,"PNC has amazing benefits. Coworkers are awesome. incentive is sometimes hard to achieve depending on your location. So that means bonuses aren't as common as they let you believe in your interview. How you thrive really depends on how your manager trains you. Wage is really good though. Training program is great, long, and full of information. So if you like a challenge work here!"
good,"Immediate work group is great and very supportive but there are a lot of managers and you are constantly being pulled in many different directions. "
good,"The people who work at PNC are what makes it great.  It's a shame that the organization doesn't put more value on their human capital.  Instead of reporting their billions of net gain every quarter, maybe they should work on fair pay for all their employees."
good,PNC Bank is a great place to work with outstanding benefits. There is a family type atmosphere that is contagious from the second you walk through the door.
good,PNC was a very diverse company to work for.  The management was very involved and part of the team.  My ability to work from home was a nice benefit to have.
good,"8:15-5:30pm is a typical work day schedule with an hour lunch. You learn something new every single day, great customers and co workers. Can be very fast paced and sometimes challenging. Part time has a more flexible schedule, but managers are very understanding and try to have a good work-life balance."
good,"The company is a great company, however in the department I was in, there was not much support in career development and job/life balance was non-existent."
good,I really enjoy working for PNC. They have always worked with my schedule as much as possible. I am very Active outside of PNC and will need a Saturday off and they will accommodate when they can.
good,"PNC is a great place to work, It has pretty good work life balance and the pay is pretty competitive for someone coming from the outside. I do with they did more for those who are part-time."
good,PNC had a good face game but behinds the scene the management did not care about their employees as much as they showed.  You were always under a microscope and they monitored your phone calls and what you did on your computer.
good,I really enjoyed working for PNC. They are good about keeping you up to date on industry training.  Managers were great. Team support.   Not so good with internal training.  I would still be there had it not been for layoffs.
good,There are great teams within the organization striving to succeed with the same goals:  Provide the highest level of customer services across the organization and external customers.
good,The day can be crazy if people don't do your job correctly. You will get real irritated with your peers because they will have this lack of drive to help people. Your peers will often transfer customers to the wrong department and do not leave any notes. Some managers are cool and some are just lazy and don't want to help.
good,"Shared a long standing union with PNC and worked remotely with some times flex work hours"
good,good not bad place to work. I recommend anyone interested in banking apply elsewhere first. The policies and procedures alone are like reading an encyclopedia online and there is little to no support on understanding how backwards there operating systems are.
good,"PNC is a good place to work; however, the work life balance is not so great. "
good,Very relaxed yet sometimes fast paced environment.  Extremely nice people to work with.  I have not seen much interdepartmental movement so not sure about promoting from within.
good,"Company has good benefits and fair compensation. Departments tend to be under staffed, partly due to turnover. Overall work environment is good, and employees are helpful and collaborative."
good,"I've learned that working in a bank doesn't mean glamorous, customers can still be unpredictable, 50-50 ratio of rudeness. Some customer can be really friendly."
good,"it was an ok place to work. I worked on the first floor at firstside with no windows. half hour lunch. two 15 minute breaks, the department I worked in closed. the separation agreement was good."
good,"PNC has policies that allow Work From Home for certain situations that benefit the company, although in the last few months this seems to be somewhat changing."
good,PNC is a good company to work for.  My co-workers were like family. Used to have a lot of incentives for the employees but have currently discontinued them.
good,"During my tenure with pnc i enjoyed working with my branch teams. I performed in many capacities from teller, customer service, sales, cold calling via phone."
good,"Pnc is an awesome place to work especially for someone fresh out of high school. They pay well for a first time job and in general for that matter. There is plenty of room for advancement and every manager I’ve had has pushed me to advance. The reason I don’t want to work there is that it’s not in my line of work, I’m just tired of doing something I didn’t go to school to do."
good,"work and home balance, benefits were good, like the vacation perks and professional growth. i would recommended PNC for someone who is starting banking for the first time."
good,"PNC is a great place to have and maintain a comfortable career. There are development opportunities, and other education benefits that make it nice for someone starting out in a technical space (model dev, analytics, automation), however if you are in these areas and what to work with new tech, this is not the place to be for long."
good,"overall great no  advancement though. retail is great, but unless you live in corporate office area then there are no advancement opportunitites but retail and everyone is fighting for those"
good,"Pros:Good work/life balance. Great company for working moms. Flexible schedule."
good,"Unrealistic goals for production, Hard to move up and make more money. Good work/life balance. Great PTO. The people you work with really make the job matter. I developed great friendships there."
good,"I am a hard worker, with many years of experience. I manage my team and help when needed with other teams in our department. "
good,"The management structure needs some work, or at least that what seems to be the case on my department. Each department seems to work as their own island, governed by the head of the department."
good,"Its a typical banking environment however, moving up in the company is is not the easiest of task. Also, the compensation is not the best. The area I worked in was also not the best"
good,"Worked for PNC in their Operations Center for roughly 11 years. Overall a very good experience. Management was fair and very interested in employee satisfaction. Seemed they fell behind a bit technologically, but were taking steps to catch up. Salary was very fair and health benefits were adequate."
good,Your Typical 9-5 costumer service/ Sales job. Teaches you compassion but it helps if you can discern the truth. Management is active in your development  and actively foster a type of workplace family culture. The hardest part of the job is dealing with costumers but it can also be the best.
good,"Typical day at work: Morning log-in, work is distributed each hour"
good,"Overall, a great organization.  I think once we determine what direction we want to commit to in terms of the retail platform, we are going to take it to another level.."
good,PNC was a great place to work.
good,"PNC as a whole is a good company with great advancement opportunities, but they will cut you out if you aren't immediately making them money and forcing products down people's throats.  Even the experienced employees refuse to push the products, and as a result they are overlooked for advancement."
good,No issues; it’s a job; allows you opportunities that other companies may not be willing to provide. Has it’s goods and bad but each company does. You can succeed
good,Very fast moving and lots to learn.  It is rewarding with knowledge learned. Different systems and loans in different parts of the country. Get to meet lots of people in various walks of life.
good,"The two departments that I was a part of while at PNC had amazing management. I was never afraid to talk to any of my managers about any issues I had involving work, work hours, or any other issues that may have popped up. My only true complaint about PNC revolved around salary and pay increases. Other banks in the area and in the industry pay their employees a lot more than what PNC does and that was ultimately a huge factor in looking for employment elsewhere."
good,"Management can be good or bad depending on location and the person managing the branch. There are opportunities to advance, but will take some time to gain experience before qualifying for advancement. It's usually laid back environment."
good,PNC is a great company during this time the mortgage industry was going through huge changes and it became very difficult to service the clients I worked with.
good,Could have been better but good place to work my experience wasn't at all the best but the people who work there are great the environment is great and it is a good job that pays decently but not enough for the amount of work you actually do.
good,"I've never done retail banking prior to joining PNC, but I've learned a lot in regards to the products and the the demographics of the customer who use the products."
good,I enjoyed working with most of my colleagues (within my team and across other groups) while I was at PNC. The Midwestern and Western Pennsylvania culture makes it more homey than other places I have been at. It also seemed to me that you have a better chance to shine if you are diligent and capable person. It could open up opportunities to grow.
good,a Typical day at work was busy.  Because I did all the auditing I loved meeting new people as they came in. I learned more about my management skills.
good,"I love the company, I am just struggling to get an advancement in my career or even an interview despite my qualifications. I will say that  some of my coworkers have had fewer issues. Overall I don't want to be retail anymore and recruiters are not working with me internally. My managers (past and present) are doing their best to help me succeed."
good,"Typical day involved processing home loan documents - I learned procurement - the management was poor - got to personal with employees, there was nothing hard about this job."
good,It was a great place to work.  Great entry job. the hours were great and the pay was nice.  The training was nice.  The people were great  to work with.  Great company.
good,I enjoyed the job just wish the salary would have been more.  I would have stayed then. If anyone applies just understand you in this area of Vrgina can not live on what they pay alone.
good,"PNC provided and good, positive work environment with solid management in place. Employees were respected and credited for a job well done. Facility and parking were positive. Lower salaries in the banking industry."
good,"Environment dedicated to its clients and employees , PNC values their employees work life balance. PNC has many services and solutions to help Benefit clients financial well being"
good,"PNC is a strong financial company with basically fair benefit and compensation packages. However, the recent industry wide restructure of retail banking had a significant impact toward limiting opportunities for career advancement in retail banking specifically."
good,"A typical day at PNC was always very productive. It was fast paced with deadlines that needed to be met. I learned to work accurately and well under pressure. The management was good, always ensuring employees were trained and knew their functions and was always helpful in advancement. The most difficult part of the job was ensuring proper communication. I enjoyed balancing accounts the most in the reconciling aspect of my job."
good,Staff in the 6 branches that I oversee are professional and friendly.  Great environment within the branch offices working with my partners branch staff.
good,If your looking to be judged on a daily bases and have everyone on your team see how good or bad your doing this job is great. Pay is great the people you work with and around are amazing.
good,"work in customer service so a typical work day is anwersing questions about one's mortgage (escrow, balane, payoff) it can be stresfful constant changes"
good,Great work life balance. Learned a lot about loans and how to process. Workplace culture is average. Hardest part of the job is the unexpected that happens at work.
good,The duties were pretty easy.  The people were polite and friendly.  The environment was easy-going.  There was room for advancement.  It was pretty boring working there.
good,The branch I worked in was pretty slow so I was loaned out to a few of the other branches regularly. It was always fun meeting new people but it is an adjustment. People were very competitive there was always some kind of referral contest at every branch. My manager was awesome but not all are the same.Overall it was fun.
good,"j have been doing mortgage loans for 2o years i need a change. "
good,PNC can be a great place to work if you are looking for advancement in a specific area (Retail Management) or are willing to relocate to a couple major cities. The commission setup is difficult to make work depending on what area you work. It can be a very stressful job because of quotas that change depending on what is lacking in the area
good,"Very good management at the branch I worked at, as well as very consistent workable hours. There was not much down time, and there was room for advancement if finance is your career goal."
good,The job for me itself was difficult as to why I'm no longer there. Some people were very nice and helpful and as any place some were not. The management was very nice and did try to help. I learned a little more with computers there. I ha checks come in that you had to figure out the problems with and then have them fixed. I did enjoy some of my time there.
good,"1 decent place to work "
good,"wasn't a horrible experience"
good,"You'll get skills here and have opportunities to add value in your position as a BSA.  New opportunities popping up as the company moves to Agile/Scrum for PM and software development.  Hard to get ahead - they'll give you a title, but it doesn't come with much of a commensurate raise in salary. But it's stable - one of the largest employers where I live - and people tend to stick around overall.  The benefits are above average."
good,"For the most part, it was enjoyable working at PNC. The people I worked with & the customers were great. The only reason I left was for a better opportunity."
good,Great company that is always evolving to stay ahead of the competition.  Clients constantly state that PNC delivers an experience unlike any other financial institutions.
good,"It's okay. The culture was real cliquey. It was laid back and fun. Turn over would be high because it was hard to advance into other departments. I had good times, but bad times too."
good,Good working place and nice environment.  Encouraging management and staff.  Overall job security and liberal in paid leaves and working hours.  I suggest its a nice company.
good,"I Loved every single manager I has at PNC. But it is a corporation so you have to keep that in mind. Lots of lays offs, no advancements. You went no where really fast there I was board with my job and felt I had learned all I could learn. I do not want to max out at 60k after putting in 30 years. That just was not for me. Some love it , but I needed more. Great benefits and management, and a okay company. But just not for me"
good,"Very active culture, looking for ways to improve things, it is just slow because it's a large bank. They do confront challenges when necessary, and people are willing to discuss issues openly."
good,"It's nice to work there and great team work but healthcare options sucks. 5000 deductible and then pay is way low that any other sector. having good education does not benefit you, high school graduate get same as MBA there."
good,"The environment started to become convoluted. There was a change in management structure, and it was not geared toward customer relations. However, over the years that I spent being employed by PNC Bank, I built strong knowledge in many areas and engaged in top client relations."
good,In hindsight I truly enjoyed my time at PNC.  I would go back there knowing what I know now.  I believe the company was fair with their employees and gave back as what was expected.
good,"Verifying that staff has the access needed to perform their job duties, no more and no less.  Verification of managerial approval for access requested.   Provided security and access for projects, production issues, and integrations within the bank.  "
good,a typical work day was full of interesting phone calls meeting customers from all over the world. everyday you leaned something new. management was exceptional they cared about you as a person and an employee the  hardest part of the job was meeting daily goals. the most enjoyable part of the job  was making lasting impressions on the customers.
good,Fastpaced environment and Highly engaging work culture.time working for the company was short but highly productive considering the type of work i had to do
good,Good company when it comes to being able to advance quickly. However pay is lacking compared to external hires and internal transfers are often underpaid and undervalued. benefits are good.
good,Work in cubicles helping customers with online banking concerns & questions. Rewarding work experience. I work evenings and the atmosphere is quiet but the call volume is very high.
good,"This is a great place to work, advancement may not come fast but the people are wonderful. They really let you come to work and do your job efficiently without the micro management."
good,Good work life balance but job itself is very stressful. I have learned a lot about the industry but would like to learn more. Although very challenging at times it can be rewarding as well.
good,"We had a busy branch. Customers would come for different transactions. I learned new things related to banking, met new people, and enjoyed helping customers."
good,"Overall, a very good company. It was a positive working culture with many great people in management and staff. The biggest issue for me was that the product line that I worked with in collections became extinct. The jobs I had in collections were incentive based. When I was transferred to another department, the incentive opportunities were not there. So this caused me to me to have decreased income even though I was a good standing employee with the company for years."
good,Overall experience was nice. The atmosphere was pleasant and the job work/ life balance was key to all employees. they were nice with family issues and or time off if needed
good,PNC is a great place to work. Coaching and development is their key to success. Everyone works as a team. It can be trying at times depending upon your position and location when it comes to work/life balance.
good,I worked there for 7 years and was treated fairly.  Left on my own accord to pursue a more challenging job.  very relaxed atmosphere with good benefits.
good,"I loved working here and always having the opportunity/possiblilty to take online classes to learn different aspects of the banking industry.  But we were often short tellers, and I would be asked to travel to different branches to help out."
good,"Depending on the department and what you may like PNC is a great place to have a career start with plenty of opportunity to learn and grow. I was in customer service. The management wasn't the best nor the worst. The new manager of the entire building wasn't nice at all and if you didn't want to get to know more about her and how to be like her then she didn't treat you too well. You know ""suck up""! If you can make some work friends this particular department will go by fast in a large cubical setting."
good,Every aspect works with each other. The company benefits show that the company cares. It works to give a work life balance and with a family that is the most important to me.
good,"Once I advanced to work at home, this completely changed my work / life balance. I am very grateful to have had this opportunity however I believe the pay could be higher based on the multitude of chats handled at one time along with bonus for the upgrades completed / stats maintained."
good,"I really liked working there because it was very laid back,  Work with a great MLO and enjoyed every day.  Always learned something new every day.  Very understanding between work and family balance.  No time card punching because they trusted you, as long as you did your work you could come in early and leave early."
good,I enjoyed working for the company. I started off with a great manager that was willing to always help when needed. Then ended my employment due to the new manager being too involved in personal life as opposed to his employees hitting numbers
good,"Although the pay could be a lot better, the work environment is very good.  Employees work together to provide an outstanding customer experience.  I would recommend this company."
good,Your are dealing with individuals who have encountered banking issues.  Whether it is a matter of an overdrawn account or problems accessing their account on line you are the first person people call.
good,Job is okay there's a lot of room for advancement. The pay can suffice in the beginning but you'll eventually make more as long as you switch departments. If you like taking calls all day and sitting down this may be the perfect fit for you
good,Good people to be around when I was at my branch in Philadelphia. The hours were challenging but I enjoyed my time there. The days were exciting and the idea of reaching my sales goals always helped me.
good,"I worked as a bank teller for one of PNC'S Banking Centers. It was fast paced work. I helped assist customers with there banking needs withdrawing cash, deposit cash, process payments, cash checks, etc."
good,"Love the culture and leadership. Very little work life balance  however, company is very understanding of employee need.  Sales are easy to achieve."
good,PNC has a great culture of taking care of their employees. They offer alot of perks for them. Enjoyed working with my colleages. They also encourage professional growth for their employees.
good,Love this place... been here 13 years!  Lots of positions in Miamisburg to consider.  Leadership is very professional and I love the culture.
good,"I have learned a lot in the 16 years of banking that I have done."
good,I enjoyed  working for PNC Bank.  I learned a lot about the banking industry and its a teamwork environment. The highlight of each of my days was my customers. I enjoyed our conversations and helping them.
good,"This is the best place to work. The staff and colleagues are simply awesome.Good Learning Scope, can get chance to learn different technologies. Just loved it."
good,"My typical day consist of reviewing all commercial loans assigned to my queue. Verify any and all documents received for each request. I learned how to work in a fast pace environment. I get along with all my co-workers. We all help out one another. The hardest part of the job for me is getting there. I have recently moved and this is why I'm looking for a new position closer to home. The commute is driving me crazy, but I do what I have to do until I find another."
good,"Good company trying to be a good corporate citizen.  Best part of the job: Working with clients, both internal and external."
good,While my departure was acrimonious my overall experience with PNC was pleasant the employees are knowledgeable and polite and form bonds with clients.
good,"i work at pnc bank, its okay with just about everything, but the work in non rewarding, and the managers are crazy in the current low rate environment. they've lost their work/life balance appeal"
good,I was able to advance through PNC rather quickly with a lot of hard work and dedication. If you have the will to succeed they will assist you with your development.
good,"Answering phone calls from internal lines of business to help with customer requests/issues"
good,"Compared to our competitors PNC pays on the lower end of the scale, however within recent months a motion has been passed to make pay more competitive to reduce loss of employees to other companies. Slowly were getting there. Overall I love working for PNC, the benefits are average as far as medical, dental, vision; but they do offer a great 401k match, company paid employee life insurance and tons of training and workshops for advancement."
good,On an average I rated PNC Bank with 4 out ot 5 stars in most catagories.  I really enjoyhed the Fitness Challenges and always look forward to the Meetings with the bank's CEO.
good,"I love working for the company however the compensation is not quite where I wish it were. Great advancement opportunities to broaden your experience but no real shift in salary. I have a great manager, but I do believe this aspect could really make or break your experience."
good,"Opportunity for growth is very evident"
good,"Over all, a good place to work. If you have tough skin and can take verbal abuse from immature customers, this is a good place to earn some paper. Must be a good researcher and problem solver, because the training provided is seriously lacking. On the other hand, upward mobility is always possible if you tough it out and adapt quickly."
good,"I learned so much financial information that will help me in my future. I enjoyed doing volunteer work for PNC. I got the training I need to do the job I was asked to do. I tell all my friends and family if they need a job, to apply with PNC Bank. My co-workers were helpful and nice. I am still really good friends with a few of them.  The hardest part of the job for me is I would worry if I hit my personal goal every month. Management was great about the time I need off for my medical needs. They were very understanding."
good,Not much in terms of pay though which can be a struggle especially with the amount of work you do and money you bring in. Very easy to advance up the ladder if you show the commitment and work ethic typically only hires from within which is nice to see.
good,"I begin each day by greeting my manager and co-workers. We are a close knit, diverse team of talented individuals. I strongly believe in starting the day on a positive note. I arrive early in order to make sure that I'm logged on and ready to start on time. I listen to my voicemail messages and then respond to any emails that were sent to me after business hours. My job title can be listed as Business Banking Collector, Default Specialist, Business Banking Customer Service Rep, or Special Assets Coordinator. All of these titles are equally correct. My job is much more than just calling people who haven't paid their bills on time. I work with small business owners on a daily basis. These people care deeply about their banking relationships. They must be treated with the utmost respect, in order to ensure a healthy and mutually beneficial business relationship. I always give my clients the benefit of the doubt. I investigate the cause of delinquency before contacting anyone. I check loan agreements, branch notes, customer service notes and all recent payment transactions. A big part of my job is to fix bank errors before they become customer irritations. There are many variables at play when investigating delinquency. Adjustments are a positive alternative to collection calls. As a courtesy, I always contact the client's Relationship Manager in order to make them aware of the necessary adjustments. However, there are times when the client is simply not able to make a payment. People react to the stress differently. Some clients lash out at the bank, but others simply ask for help."
good,I Enjoy working with the people that I work with they make the job that has to be done every day a lot easier to do. I also have managers that are willing to fight on our behalf for the thing that we feel would make our industry better.
good,"A typical work day was going into work at 9:00 am, going into my workspace, logging into my computer, checking my email, also to see if I had to finish any work that was left undone from the previous day.  We would attend the daily stand-up meeting, where we would discuss about the work we did yesterday, what we doing today, and is there anything that is preventing us to do our work further.  I had a great team to work with, we communicated very well and got along.  I enjoyed being a tester, and tested the application till I broke it, I have the tester to break attitude where I would find a bug in the application before the functionality was pushed into the next environment"
good,"If you have ever worked in customer service and sales, this is a great way to get into a M-F, 8-5 type of job. Tellers make a bonus based on referrals for other bank products. Also, for scores based on calls to customers to rate their experience. Nice hours, good pay, great benefits, are a plus!"
good,"Analyzing client needs using consultative approach.  Full financial managment including portfolio, planning, trust, and backing services"
good,"PNC is a great company to work for .  The WorkPlace Banking department was a wonderful department, they care about you as an employee."
good,"I enjoyed working for PNC, I had many customers that are loyal to me.  "
good,A good company to work for . positive and supportive management and colleagues . Training in all areas within the bank are offert and a lot of challenging and exciting projects
good,"Soliciting new clients for the Bank growing assets and liabilities together with non-interest income in categories including leasing, term and revolving debt, employee benefits, retirement plans, merchant services, etc."
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my experience very my at PNCI.  My direct manager was easily the best in my career.  Upper management doesn't seem to value advisors, considering them as replaceable cogs."
good,PNC is a very different bank. Every year of tuition reimbursement requires three more years of service or you will need to pay it back.
good,Greeat Company to work for and opportunity for advancement. Plenty of different roles within the bank industry to find something enjoyable .
good,I enjoy working with my peers that make my day delightful and willing to help others on a daily basis is the reason why I enjoy my job everyday.
good,"High stress job, lots of hours, excellent pay, great co-workers, great work place conditions.  Good management, can use improvement."
good,"The benefits were excellent. Competitive salary plus Health Insurance, Dental Insurance, Eye Insurance, Pension, 401K program that PNC matches up to 10%, 3 weeks paid vacation and incentives. Management needed  a little bit of work. There are certain managers with poor leadership skills and little confidence in themselves. It is very evident by a simple conversation with some of these managers."
good,WBB (Web Based Banking) helps online banking customers to see past transactions and plan for future ones that will apply for selected accounts. WBB online banking tracks the incoming and outgoing cash over time. WBB is integrated with CFI (Cash flow Insight) and BDC (BillDotCom) services for maintaining Cashin/Cashout accounts in CFI and bills/Invoices in BDC.
good,Love the job and the people that work with me.  The only thing I didn't like about the job was the pay. Everyone got along and it was a great place to work.
good,"PNC generally is all about 5 star service to its clients and maintaining brand consistency within the PNC footprint. A typical day for me would be operating as a Teller, Personal Banker and Staff Support. I have to wear many hats as a Customer Service Associate. Managements job primarily is to make sure that all goals are met regarding sales & customer service scores. In addition to ensuring that policy and procedures are being followed at all times. Everything is very team oriented with regards to both wins and losses as a branch. Therefore, a morning huddle is done each day to ensure that the branch team is on the same page. I have learned how to seriously multitask and continuously learn how to prioritize according to urgency. Some challenges may have included dealing with needy or disgruntled customers on occasions. Nevertheless, when I see that someone has truly been blessed by my services that definitely puts a smile on my face. At the end of the day if me doing my job made someone else's life better that is a great reward."
good,"PNC bought and sold mortgages, for the most part my job was approving easements for the city,  if work needed to be done by the city I had to make sure there was enough equity in the home before allowing this.  My co-workers all had other jobs so I didn't get to interact a lot but all were very nice.  There was so much to this position I didn't get the chance to learn the hard vs good.  I left there to work for Abbott."
good,"had to receive 5 star rating in customer service, got to know a lot of customers, great co-workers had to make sure drawers and vault balance"
good,"My day is always busy,I do a number of things thorughout my day.  I came in as a Teller and within 4 months I am doing the Teller Supervisor position.  I deal with a variety a customers some good and some bad."
good,A typical day at PNC would entail the installation and troubleshooting of local and remote desktops/laptops.  I have learned a great deal about Network support in my 15 years at PNC.  Management seems very knowledgeable and genuinely care about employee advancement.  I have worked with a great group of people at PNC and would call all of them friends.  The hardest part of the job is not being able to help a client due to hardware failures or necessary policy restrictions.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the joy I get from helping people every day.
good,"I am currently a loan support analyst to where I work in the host system and changed the system to show the modification that the customer applied for. At times, the job is not hard but can be stressful. The team that I work with is awesome and are willing to help each other out if need be.  Management is laid back and very easy to talk to.  It can be hard to get the coaching and development that is needed since they are all in meetings."
good,A typical day at work is fast paced with many responsibilities to help us to provide  exceptional service. We make our main goal to offer products and services that represent our brand as well as best  suit the needs of our customers.
good,"There were two great lessons I learned at PNC: "
good,"Enjoyed helping people with their accounts and fixing anything that I could. The diverse atmosphere was very enjoyable, as well."
good,Opportunity for advancement is present.  Clear communication to upward management.  Low to moderate starting salaries.  Work/Life balance as a branch employee is mediocre due to branch hours.
good,"decent place to work, good for most entry level help desk position, if that is what you are looking for. Corporate culture is on par for most help desk departments"
good,"answer customer's questions and concerns, trouble shoot and problem solving.  Explore customer's relationship with PNC and find products to make banking easier for them."
good,"Would take phone calls most the day, with meetings and coaching sessions in order to identify possible areas for improvement. Would always get very positive feedback. Very stressful job, in which threats and being cussed out were a daily occurrence. Still, I absolutely loved the job. Learned to handle high stress, high pressure situations. Learned how to handle and manage large money accounts and acquisitions. Developed my customer relation skills further; mainly my communication skills, but also learning how to work in a fast paced, aggressive work environment. Learned a lot. Most enjoyable part of the job was being able to explain situations to people and help give them some piece of mind."
good,I like this company we treat each other like a family. I learned how to handle different kind of job functions.
good,I am currently in a rotational development program.  Management is great and really seems to care about your progress.
good,A decent place to work but the management needs to listen to employee concerns more often.
good,Conduct meeting with business sponsors to elicit requirements. Translate the business requirements into User Stories. Met with the development team and QA team to review the requirements to make sure its clearly understood. Assist PM run daily scrums.
good,good people decent management and work life balance i little to micro managed but not bad
good,I had the same supervisor from prior company. I enjoyed working with my coworkers.
good,"great management"
good,Enjoyed the customers.  Several years in the same position was very difficult for advancement.
good,Great name in community and nationwide helps drive in business. Employees do a good job of referring clients from within the branches.
good,Depends on Management that you are under. Overall good workplace.
good,"*Every morning i hold a daily quick start meeting to establish daily goals/plans."
good,PNC Bank offers a great work/life balance.  I have enjoyed working there for the past 6+ years.  Co-workers are great.
good,Loved working in the north east from the DM to co workers everyone is like family!!! and all with bend over backwards to help and train for advancement...
good,"Friendly staff, managers and supervisors approachable at almost any part of the day if needed.  My goal is to directly and properly assist as many that are in need. "
good,"Overall, I love this job. My co-workers are wonderful, management is great when not stressing about our CIQ or quota. On a typical day, we sign in, greet customers, process a few deposits or withdrawals, etc. Business has been slow. The hardest part of this job is finding a way to get to work since I live 10mi away. The most enjoyable about this job is meeting our regular clients and making them, and every other client, feel special and satisfied with our suggestions of products. I've learned much information at PNC, I'm not business savvy so it helps."
good,I had great time working with company started with them when the company first merged with RBC bank
good,PNC Bank is a good place to work.I want to move on the develop more professionally.
good,My experience at PNC was great. Co-workers were a joy to be around. Enjoyed building relationships with customers and staff.
good,"I really liked working there..Mgmt never talked down to you, and always asked for feedback."
good,Great company and place to work for. Benefits are not that good because it is a smaller company.
good,I learned to maximize multi-tasking. The manageent and had great co-workers and a fun working environment.
good,"A typical workday is extremely busy, but it makes the day go by faster. My coworkers are very nice and fun to work with. The managers are very professional and laid back."
good,I love the people that I worked with. The company have great opportunities.
good,"Most recently acted as Branch Manager for a 5 month period while the current manager was out and continued sales success for the remaining quarter. "
good,A a Columbus based bank with room to grow and advance within the company.
good,"A typical day at work involves supporting 5-7 Senior Bankers through prospecting, cold calls, financial modeling, and creating pitch books to increase our market position in the southeast.  Other day-to-day responsibilities include client interactions to provide products/services or solve issues, deliver Term Sheets/Commitment Letters, monitoring the deal process from execution to closing."
good,Working for PNC was great.  They were always rewarding us and recognizing employees.  I just wish they paid better and gave more room for higher salaries.
good,"Awesome work environment, Awesome Managers, and  Awesome co-workers. "
good,"I used to work as the Part Time Teller there and then moved up the ranks as the Teller Supervisor. A huge part of my work was related to customer service, we used to have a constant flow of people always coming in and out. I had a wonderful supervisor who taught me how to do the work. The customer always comes first. As long as we do that part well, the rest just follows."
good,enjoyed working at PNC however I wanted to advance and learn more office procedures
good,"Well trained coworkers"
good,"I have worked at various banks in Chicagoland: MB Financial, First Midwest, and National City (now PNC)."
good,"Assist multiple Loan Officers with VA, FHA and Conventional Purchase and Refi loan transactions. Have direct and constant communication with the Borrower, Realtors, Underwriters and Loan Processors throughout the loan process from set-up to closing. Order appraisals, credit reports, title and insurance. Process Closing Letters as directed by Loan Officer."
good,I very much enjoyed the people and customers that I worked with. We were constantly adding new products and procedures to improve life for our customers and our day to day work environment.
good,"What i have learned is that we are disposable and technology is replacing us quickly."
good,"Professional, the American express of Branch Banking. Job has benefits of personal recognition in community and the opportunity for advancement. Pay is better than most, but needs to be raised. Most educational experience I have had."
good,"PNC is going through the hard times in banking just like every bank.  As banking continues to evolve less people are necessary, in order to conduct the banks day to day business.  Therefore, jobs that in the past were relationship building jobs have become sales jobs pushing widgets.  I believe that the customer still can be helped but as Chase Bank became more sales driven the smaller banks followed suit."
good,"Small business banking"
good,"work was great all day"
good,"The employee that work for the company is what makes it a good experience.  However, it really depends on the branch in which you work.  Overall the benefits are good and compensation is okay.  Salary is really not competitive."
good,Very fast pace environment. PNC is a good bank to work for as it is mostly commercial business.
good,"PNC has, over the past few years, slowly eliminated positions while demanding more from the still working employees. Overall  a good company to work for with a decent benefits package."
good,"a typical day at work is transaction, customer service, and working with currency."
good,call center environment. worked at home. answered 100+ call per day addressing customers banking issues and questions.
good,"You will learn great sales techniques and how to address yourself professionally over the phone. A very tedious job with constant changing variables from customer to customer. You will enjoy helping others get through financial troubles and help them get their financial back on track. Co-workers are great, but management loves to micro-manage."
good,Overall I have had a great experience with PNC with some minor problems throughout.
good,Had a great opportunity to perform daily settlement between PNC and eight other participating Banks.
good,Great culture and opportunity for Advancement within. Company values are consistent throughout.
good,"I arrive at work at 8 am, i procceed with my dail requirements of depositing currency and withdrawing it as well. My co-workers and I work together to accomplish more together. It is a fun ,enjoyable environment where the only part that is difficult is not being able to service all the customers needs"
good,"Very systematic, strict day to day routine. Opening, during and closing procedures are expected to be followed through perfectly at the discretion of every supervisor, assistant manager and manager. Tellers expected to perform client transactions at the very minimum, with required pushing of sales, (must open a certain amount of accounts per month), as well as take on a major role within the company to prove worthiness of advancement, on top of all other responsibilities assigned by all superiors. Hardest part of the job is meeting monthly sales requirements. Most enjoyable part is the client relationship building and ease of computerized transactions."
good,Great place to work. Management is very open and reachable. Friendly work enviorement and good facilities. I also like all the benefits of working in a financial institution (bank).
good,"PNC has high standards for client satisfaction, and strives 110% each time."
good,"PNC is a good bank to work for. PNC is here for their clients, and truly care about their employees."
good,I balance the bank's general ledger accounts for their Debit card and Brokerage card products. I research out of balance discrepancies and inquiries from service partners. I get along well with my co-workers and consider myself to be the ideal team player.
good,working with customers on a daily basis to make sure all of their financial aspects are taken care of.
good,"very good training,poor employee relationships. Very god benefits and incenitives"
good,-Providing excellent customer service skills to each PNC customer.
good,"My day typically began by opening the branch, setting up daily cash buys, loading the Atm and customer night depository transactions. While operating a teller window I also pulled reports checked audit items and supervised the teller line. As supervisor, i never asked my tellers to do a task that I wouldn't do, building a mutual respect. The hardest part of my job was leaving at the end of the day and the most enjoyable was arriving each morning. I truly enjoyed my job."
good,Day consisted of supervising a teller staff of seven
good,"The location that I work at is a warm, friendly, family oriented environment."
good,Fast-paced and busy. I learned how to use a ten-key encorder machine for the first time. It was exciting. Management was fair and patient with new employee. Co-workers showed a willingness to help when it was allowed. The hardest part was sitting around at times waiting for the next batch of work to arrive. The most enjoyable part was when all the work was finished before it was expected to be completed.
good,"Very busy call center, good training in terms of account selling."
good,A great employer. Management is good. The hardest part of the job for me is the limited advancement for this company. the most enjoyable part of the job is interactions that I have everyday.
good,"PNC is a growing and solid company to work for. With them buying up banks left and right, there is a definite feeling of job security. The health plans/IRA/vacation benefits are nice, but unless an employee has a college degree in business or an experienced business background there is little room for advancement and/or opportunities. (Makes sense given the fact that it is a bank!)"
good,Pnc provides extensive training and there's always someone to talk to and ask for help. Management can be better; honesty and straight forwardness are much better than going around and creating drama at mgmt level
good,"PNC is a great place to work with energizing people and a good culture for inclusiveness. If you are looking to come in, do your job and leave for your personal activities its a great place to work. Upward mobility can be a struggle for those looking to quickly climb the ladder."
good,"I interned previously at a boutique wealth management firm and had a blast. I was on the phone and working hard to get leads for my advisors. At PNC the development program isn't geared towards that and I want to be out in the field, meeting with clients, and closing sales."
good,"The management at PNC cares about its employees.  Some areas offer more flexibility with workload and location.  Management encourages development, and teammates like to help each other succeed."
good,Helps employee to succeed. Give time to employee to work on there pace.Where employee need help management is there for them. The company helps to maintain work and life balance.
good,Had a very good working experience and learning new things in Salesforce application. Senior management was very co-operative and accomodative in understanding the changing dynamics.
good,"A good company to work for good benefits, excellent compensation for days off. lots of job opportunity and excellent maternity leave along with excellent child care assistance"
good,"The company had many on job employee benefits such as guest speakers, free luncheons and other perks. They also had employee financial incentatives such as employee stock plans. loans and savings. Extensive training and development events"
good,"Every day is different, lots of opportunities to learn outside of the constant ongoing bank required training, very inclusive culture.  Its always fun to meet new people and help them wiht their financial and mortgage needs."
good,This is a great place to learn and grow skills when working with the public. You have to know how to defuse situations and learn the products and behaviors
good,"The corporate culture tries to pretend that there are reasons to show up to work that aren't money- and fails miserably. While ample leave time and a great management staff are massive advantages, they dont compensate in any way for living paycheck to paycheck"
good,"Very open and diverse place to work. I felt that I was working for a successful financial institution with a bright future. As with other banks, yearly raises were about 2% which is not enough."
good,"Overall great company to work for.  Good pay, good work/life balance, and good opportunity for advancement.  Would have stayed aside from personal/medical reasons that required me to leave due to not qualifying for any type of leave when it occurred."
good,"Due to the larger size of the company compared to other regional banks and bank broker dealers, there are a multitude of job opportunities available. The company does a good job of growing employees and promoting from within. Downsides include a less-than competitive compensation structure and having to drive & park downtown."
good,"Overall, PNC bank had a great work culture. My boss was amazing, and very understanding, and willing to help me. I always felt included, but not challenged enough."
good,In general its a great place to work. Good amout of vacation days and pretty good benefits. Great hours in retail banking. One of the best companies I have worked with.
good,I enjoyed my time at PNC.  The training was exceptional and I felt like part of the team from day one. My time there was valued and I will take what I learned to my next opportunity.
good,"There are a lot of benefits the PNC offers. They have a wellness program that is highly beneficial with other resources as well for things such as adoption support, counseling support, with may others."
good,"They were constantly laying people off and threatening to lay off, even recently hired people. "
good,"I had a great experience during my internship at PNC in which I was able to shadow many different positions and partners within the bank, and was given many great experience opportunities that I otherwise might not have had."
good,Always lots of work to do and management pushes you to always do better. Very competitive environment with little opportunity for growth. Definitely a little more milder than investment banking for a bulge bracket.
good,A day in the life at PNC consists of assisting clients with their financial needs. Supervising and coaching teller team to be the best that they can be.
good,PNC Bank was extremely transparent with it's mission as well as it's goal. There were many opportunities to learn and grow within the company. Although it was monotonous at times there are various ways to make changes from within.
good,"The company has an excellent work-life balance, culture, benefits, and growth opportunities for its employees.  The working environment is goal oriented across the organization with a friendly/family collaborative touch to achieve its objectives."
good,It helped me get into the doors of banking but there's not much opportunities to advance. Advancing and raises are based on favoritism unfortunately but I learned a lot.
good,I was at a consolidated branch and I went for a promotion but I feel pnc lacks in management choosing or coaching due to the coverage areas being so big and only maintained by one person.
good,"Branch manager was great, upper management was not supportive.  In the past 8 years, 4 branches will have closed in the downriver area.  Banking is just changing drastically and I expect more to close in the future.  Not a bad bank.. just the way banking is now"
good,"The environment at PNC was friendly, though the management and how business was conducted left a lot of room for improvement. "
good,"Each group ion PNC operates in a silo and there seems to be no will to change that.  Upper management is very good, but middle management lacks vision and was not always transparent.  There is an extreme focus on resolving issues but not a focus on preventing small problems before they escalate."
good,Everything was fine for the most part until the goals started to happen and wanted you to make high credit card goals and opening accounts as well but it was a good first job to get into banking.
good,Certain branches are easier to work at. The branch I worked at had poor management. Other branches I visited or assisted with were very laid back and fun work environments.
good,"This is a great place to work for the benefits and pay, but if you're looking to advance it's almost impossible. The pay is great for what you do, but working to death (days days with Sundays off) can get stressful when you're missing out on family stuff."
good,"I worked for PNC as a teller. I learned how to manage multiple tasks at once, answer phone calls, keep up with policy changes, work with others on tasks, customer service, etc. I've learned a lot that can stat-stuff my resume for other career opportunities. You also have multiple ways to earn extra money through incentives."
good,At PNC i was able to procure better knowledge and experience the business world.  I was also able to get more experience working with people from different backgrounds.
good,It is hard to sell products when the traffic in the branches is slow and you see the same customers almost every day and the bank expects you to sell all the time to stressful
good,Learned a lot because this was my first banking position. Day went fast due to high traffic  of customers. Management most were good & helpful. Liked  all associates I worked with.
good,I worked for 2 managers who were the best I have had.  Still friends with both and would walk through fire for them.  Upper management had no clue what they were doing
good,Business is high energy and expectations to succeed is very important in this field. Looking for opportunities with every customer to build stronger relationship.
good,"As with all Organizations there is pros and cons. As long as you are dedicated and have the desire to be a Top Performer, the Company is pretty fair in recognizing and awarding your hard work. "
good,I believe certain branches give u a better opportunity to advance as well as more fairness between employees. I guess different branches have better business relationship rather than inappropriate relationship
good,"A typical day consists of reviewing credit, and reviewing income documents to insure I have everything I need to have the underwriter review and decision the application. I was able to work at home two days a week and I like my team. The hardest part of the job is making sure I look/verify as many deals to completion to maintain department goals because you can't control what documents you receive even if I clearly noted what I was looking for.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to work independently and having the option to work at home."
good,"Personally, my job is very stressful in a fast paced environment with very little consistency in work load. Department management is very good. I have learned a lot about a number of bank products from this job. The workplace culture is pretty good as far as teamwork is concerned but many people do not like the job itself."
good,Not my favorite place to work.  I did work part-time so I didn't get very many benefits.  In my training class I was the only part time person there.  Being part time I never had to be in charge of the ATM
good,Working in a branch is wonderful if you enjoy meeting new people and helping others.  Especially if you work at a busy branch.  Branch employees tend to be the least paid and work the hardest.  That needs to change.
good,"Overall it was a great place to work.  Co-workers were great, but some management were helpless.  Had many opportunities to move into new positions and succeed."
good,It was a decent place to work. They managed by micro managing every aspect of your day.It took so much time to make sure you following managements layers of reporting that you never got a chance to actually sell.
good,"PNC prides itself on being inclusive and diverse. The people that work there are great people. Friendly, supportive, kind and helpful. Depending on the position it can be very stressful. The pay is good and the benefits aren't bad."
good,"Good ""community bank"" feel with stability of a large institution.  Does the right things for customers and most of the time for its employees as well.  Mid-management lacks leadership and mentorship skills, mostly are top operators that needed an avenue for higher pay.  Improved management training needed.  Overall a good and stable company for high performers and low performers alike.  Not an ""up or out"" company, if you are a low performer, just stick to your lane and you'll have a happy and long career.  Top performers are well rewarded but need to remain nimble to align self with the most current and relevant leaders to survive.  Very lax work environment.  Friendly workforce that is very tolerant.  Appreciates diversity.  Remote and flex work schedule friendly / encouraged.  Acceptable benefits structures."
good,"Nice place to work, good people, Treat employees well, even if salary is less than market.  Many long term employees, showing the positive atmosphere.  The downside is that it can be hard to move up the ladder once you are in."
good,"Good Company to work for. I entered the bank as an entry level collector and have been able to work my way up and into the Underwriting Department. I currently verify income for the underwriters which help them determine the outcome for loan applications. Good benefits, work life balance is a priority to the company and they have a decent 401k matching percentage are reasons to stick around. I have made some wonderful friends around the office over the last 10 years and have felt very secure in my job."
good,"When you are first hired on it is awesome, money wise. But once you have been there for awhile no more raises. Staffing is always changing and they get hired on minimum 15.00 an hour with no experience."
good,"-inspected hundreds/thousands of medical bills each week depending on work load"
good,"PNC has a great culture that values work life balance. Just be prepared to move out of your position to earn more more money.  Also, the incentives change annually. Don't get used to the compensation structure."
good,"Great place to work for someone looking to get into the financial sector, starting pay is good as well as company benefits. Time off is better than that of most entry level positions."
good,The resources and training given to employees for the opportunity to advance their knowledge and career is very well conducted. The department leads and mangers are mostly really good people who want you to succeed and will work with you on whatever you care to improve upon. The company has a great culture inclusive of all people and backgrounds.
good,PNC has been a cool place to work.  I've been there for almost 23 years.  The only issue that I've noticed is lack of diversity in upper management.  That and the raises aren't much to be desired.
good,"thought that the grass looked greener but was wrong, should have stayed with the organization.  Good pay with opportunity to grow from within.  Although management could use a little help they seem to be getting better"
good,"Typical large regional bank - a lot of policies and rules to follow, customer service driven, plenty of different opportunities to pursue, benefits are decent, compensation is average, results driven atmosphere"
good,Was a great place to learn the work place environment of a large corporation.  It was a fast place with high demands of the people who worked there.  Very rewarding.
good,"It's a good workplace. However, be prepared to be micromanaged. There are constant sales goals to meet and your manager will expect you to always stay proactive to meet those goals."
good,"I worked 8 hrs a day, 40 hrs a week. My direct supervisor was great and really helped in any way he could. The pay just wanted competitive enough especially working in town and needing to pay for parking."
good,PNC has a very friendly work environment at least in our Vertical. Managers are open to new ideas and designs which makes sense for the bank. Good Work life balance.
good,"Good place to work, stressful, fast paced. Great hours, holidays off vacation sick time. No company holiday parties, company didn't really pay for anything"
good,"I don't understand why this is required."
good,"Great company to work for with great training, but I felt a disconnect between Retail and Corporate Banking. This meant it was hard to move up in the company because the Retail managers had little to no relationships with the corporate side."
good,"I'm happy with the way that PNC Bank treated me and as well as the way they treat their staff in general.  They're great employers.  They've taught me a lot which I have gained a lot of experience and when I left, I left feeling like I was a part of a team."
good,Good place to learn about financial reporting.  The work environment is relaxed and management does encourage work/life balance.  Manager was very understanding if I had to take off time from work for family commitments.
good,Nice work environment and decent co-workers.  Can be stressful when it gets busy so must be patient and expect upset customers. Good benefits and perks.
good,"Its a great job to start out with and they allow you to branch out after 6 months of being a standard consultant job, but it just so hard to get through the day sometimes and keep to their expectations with low call times everyday or good quality"
good,"a 830 to 530 "
good,Working with PNC was a delight. I enjoyed my peers as well as working with the public. Overall it was a nice experience with the company. I was able to gain a pay raise within  a year and relocating and transferring to different positions was acceptable.
good,Culture shifted once ownership shifted from National City Bank to PNC bank. The National City Bank culture was family oriented and allowed for professional and personal growth within the company.
good,Great hours with a strong culture for promoting within.  Strong values with great management that believe in the values they promote.  I would highly recommend this company
good,This was the least stressful job i have had in underwriting many years. Great culture and work environment to work. They truly practiced the work and life culture
good,"I love doing what I do. PNC strives to be a leader in the banking industry.I am always busy and time passes quickly. I feel I have job security in my present position."
good,A good place to work.   Salary is becoming more competitive. Enjoyed the company and working for them! Great core values and worked hard to encourage them.
good,"Production of client pitch books"
good,Work is sometimes what you make it. You your job and go home because that is what you are paid to do. I personally keep socializing to a bare minimum because I am not a super extroverted individual.
good,Allows up to one day per week working at home. The culture is relaxed but daily productivity is needed to make your goals.  Most individuals have been working at PNC for a number of years.
good,Good place to work.  Just needed  a better pay.  Managers decisions are ethical and practical. Great place as far as being rewarding. They do value their employees. Loved my Coworkers.
good,PNC Bank is a great place to work and has a very good work/life balance when advocating for it's employee's. PNC also offers wonderful benefits and focus on each employee.
good,Supervisor of two Branch Offices.  Opening protocol to established every morning for employee and client safety.  everyday operations to be monitored.  making decisions on a manager's level and safeguarding the bank.
good,"Worked here out of college.  Good place to start and you will learn a lot about money management.  Can be boring and slow but typically very low stress.  Good work life balance, you get 15 vacation days off the bat and 10 paid holidays."
good,"Across the board, retail banking salaries are low. The work environment is fantastic. There is comprehensive training for the banking products, however they seriously lack on teller training. One quick transaction could cost you your job."
good,It's a nice place to work lacks in pay and health insurance but makes up for it with time off and environment. Once again the pay could be higher seeing as though this job is repetitious and stressful at times
good,"Good company to work for. However not much opportunity for advancement. Hire managers and promote bankers to managers with  no management/leadership experience,"
good,I was with PNC bank for over 5 years and still would be if family issue didn't force me to relocate to another state. The company made it very easy to advance and provided great benefits including generous paid time off.
good,I worked at the bank in the trust department for years then went  into operations department which dealt with the day to day duties.  I posted the daily transactions.
good,Really good on separating work from home life. 3 weeks paid vacation with additional week you can purchase. Also offer 4 weeks paid maternity leave for fathers.
good,competitive. great people fast paced. very large sometimes very difficult to get cross functional collaboration. provided work life balance. lots of community volunteer work available
good,"Overall a great place to work. Great people. Depending on your role, the environment can be fast-paced and can make you feel pressured at times. Work-Life balance is great with very good benefits especially Paid time off policies. You can tell the company values its people."
good,"Supervision and management of the teller line, along with daily customer transactions in strengthening each relationship"
good,PNC has been great to work for over the last several years. Although avoid management it really takes away from the value of what the company builds their values on i.e. Work life balance.
good,"PNC is a great bank to work for. My position doesn't get paid enough, but for right now, it's good. Was a banker before I went to our operations department. Didn't like selling equity products, but if you like that, it's great!"
good,"Advancement opportunities are present, however, the pay increase has a low cap. The opposite is true of talent brought in from outside. This creates an atmosphere where new hires are paid higher salaries than those who've earned a promotion and ultimately makes folks leave. Bad business model"
good,"this job is a lot better than most. other than management within the branch that I worked for, it's worth working there. only if you're full time though. part-timers don't get as much perks as us full-time employees. pay is nice."
good,"One thing I learned is this, I cannot allow the personalities of people to be the set thermometer of the overall vision, but rather realize we are all a gathered people who are set to reach one common goal and that is to increase the value of the company and to change the overall demographics of a culture, where, through the initiative of PNC every person, family, business, etc. is prospering. "
good,"Nice to work with costumers, working with our customers helping them reach their goal in saving and learning hoe to manage their money. Working in customer service, giving them advice on their financial problems."
good,"PNC is a really great company, I work in the collections department and it's a very fast-paced job. If you get stressed easily, I don't recommend this job. The people here are incredible."
good,Excellent company to work for. Provides a competitive environment while keeping the cliques to a minimum. Compensation isn't great and takes a while to kick in.
good,"The environment was great. The people are great.  The only con I have with PNC is the compensation is on the low end for finance.  "
good,Normal banking job. Your day will be based upon what office you are in. Decent corporate culture. Very involved in the community. Room fro advancement.
good,"My time here was short, only because I was going to college full-time. On an average day, our branch manager would do funny impressions and make us laugh. He was a kind person who opened his home to us every Christmas. I loved working with my coworkers and enjoyed the regular customers."
good,"The pay was nice, they did suprise bonuses for employees and we had a pension. PNC as a company is a great place to work. Banking in general can be very competitive and catty so it just depends on who you work with. Some managers that are still there, are great."

good,"Working as a financial specialist.  Normal work day is M-F, 8:30am-5:15pm.  Work two Saturday's a month and a late night calling session.  Management was pretty good and always available for a phone call if needed.  As far as PNC as a company, I like their benefits and work / life balance.  As for job security, they are doing away with the financial specialist roll so I have to find another position within the bank or look elsewhere."

good,PNC is a great company to work for but over the last two years I have been passed over for a promotion.  I was told one of the reasons why I was passed over was because I did not ask for a promotion.  I have played sports growing up and I never asked my coach to put me in the game when the coach saw that I was ready and prepared  then he put me in the game.  I guess it was a learning experience.
good,"A typical day in work is busy with no stopping just working to your fullest potential.  I have learned that everyone has different expertise don't expect everyone to work you.  "
good,"Great company to work for however for  employees who are located in area where PNC is not prominate, it can be challenging finding growth opportunities."

There can be obstacles to getting things done (departments, old thought processes, ect.) that make this job frustrating at time. However, leadership is receptive to feedback."
good,"Working 14 years in Banking it is changing. My roles are:"
good,"Working for PNC has been by far the most rewarding job I've ever had. Great hours, along with management that takes an interest in your advancement and a fairly generous bonus structure, makes it a great place to get your feet wet in the world of finance and banking. The one thing that I could ask for is greater compensation. The quarterly bonuses are great but hourly it is a little lacking. The most rewarding part of PNC has been dealing with customers face to face and getting to help them personally improve their financial well being."
good,Not much growth opportunities.  There are positions available but they would rather hire outside than promote from within
good,"PNC has been a great company to work for however I cannot reapply into the company with in the first year and I believe our branch will be closing due to low customer usage. Otherwise, I would highly recommend this company."

good,"I was able to obtain and learn a lot of professionalism and customer service from PNC.  Day to day was hectic, usually handling about 200 to 300 calls.  When promoted to a Tier 2 became more tedious in correcting many mistakes by lower level employees, many stressful calls and constant volume.  Very high turn over in employees made it hard to maintain a good culture in the workplace."

We talk about accounts to non customers and about opportunities to existing customer to see if we can get more benefits.  Overall satisfaction is positive, management for the most part is nice, co-workers care about each other as more then just co workers, the job itself is not very difficult, and you get to meet people all the time.  If you are just out of college and need a relatively steady job while you are looking for a career opportunity, or you wish to make banking your career this is a good place to start."

good,"I really enjoyed my time at PNC, I learned a lot met some great people."
good,Very enjoyable company to work for but the mortgage business has too many ups and downs
good,Monday- Thursday is basically slow. Tellers handle all customer needs at the window and refer additional services to customer service reps. Fridays and Saturdays are very busy. The hardest part of the job was managing long lines at some branches due to few tellers on staff. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know regular customers and helping serve their financial needs.
good,"The HR Project Coordinator role consist of a combination of responsiblities and adhoc requests. In my department, I support HR Operations and Talent Aquisition initiatives. I've also had the opportunities to partner with the Training and Development on various projects."
good,"This was an excellent place to work. Professionalism was very important when working for this bank and that is something I can really appreciate. Employees were valued and often rewarded for doing well. Management was laid-back but would get down to business alongside you when it was necessary. The only complaint I could make about this company was that the pay was fairly low. Of course, getting the experience of working for a bank and all the perks that were offered made it worthwhile."
good,This is a good company to work for but the turn-over was ridiculous.
good,PNC was a great company to work for. I was impressed with the amount of training that they provide. The only item I would  address is there seems to be a lack of communication within the company overall.  The recruiting processes for new hires needs work.  Seems to be many shortfalls in this area.
good,"Good experience to start my career"
good,PNC is a great place to work for they really care about their employees and it has a family atmosphere. I learned a lot about banking and how to assist customers. I got along with all of my co-workers and I really enjoyed it when we were busy because I prefer to be busy rather then slow. Hardest part about my job was trying to keep up with all the banks changes.
good,Great company to work for.  Not an easy place to work for as a working mother.
good,PNC was a great place to work. The culture of the bank is what makes day to day success not just a possibility but a reality. There is always support there from management if you need it.
good,Always enjoyed getting to know the customers. Our branch was located in a smaller sized town and you got to know them pretty well.  Enjoyed working with the staff also.
good,Marketing is devoted to growing in a new market. Working with an outside marketing firm to ensure positive growth for each branch helps to increase market presence.
good,"PNC is a good company to work for, however like anything that you do there are going to be imperfections.  Be careful and ensure that detail is top of the list when it comes to your work."
good,"A typical day at work begins with reviewing credit approvals for new and existing accounts to determine whether or not real estate is being taken as collateral. Reviewing the details of a credit approval is necessary since not all accounts and terms therein are the same. Once it is determined that real estate will be taken as collateral, then we follow certain guidelines to determine whether or not the real estate in question is located in a flood zone. If the real estate is in a flood zone, then we are required by the Federal Regulators to perform what is called flood due diligence to ensure proper flood insurance is in place before a loan can close on an account."
good,"A typical day at PNC consisted of meeting with clients both current and new. It also consisted of conducting cold calls to clients to offer products/services, which the client was not already utilizing."
good,Great company to work for.  Many opportunities and a great leadership team.
good,"The PNc branch I currently work at is normally pretty relaxed. The only problems are with the customers who can be needy, overbearing and to be quite honest, pretty stupid because they are grown men and women who do not want to learn how to do things for themselves. Frustrating can be an understatement at times, but like i said, that is only like once a month because we have certain busy days. My co-workers are great, the management is very helpful and is always willing to teach."
good,"Responsible for planning, organizing, directing, and controlling transactions related to processing operations  Provides direction to staff members in resolving problems which arise with internal or external customers.

good,"With my job, there is not enough time to accurately do your best. In the branch I work, Pressure to hit sales goals is extremely high."
good,"My day starts out with getting my drawer, and signing onto my computer, making sure that I am stocked with cash, and other essentials that is needed to run a smooth shift, then we have our team meeting, which is sometimes fun, but mostly informative, then our doors open up to our customers.  I have found that everyday is a learning experience at my job, for one we have courses that we take, and just customer interaction, you never know what a customer needs, would like you to do, or find out for them.  I enjoy my co-workers we work as a family instead of a team, we help one another, we can also make the day go by fast just for the little things that we do to encourage the other person.  The hardest thing about my job I think is when you work for a big branch, you lose some of the personal connection with your customers, and sometimes that is difficult, most customers want that personal one on one, and in my position as a teller you have to look at everything and sometimes not that you want that but it gets lost because you are trying to help and get your customers in and out in a reasonable time.  The most enjoyable is when my customer have a problem and you have helped them  and the look on their faces have that relieve smile, and you hear thank you, to me helping my customers is  so important, and making sure that their needs are met me alot."
good,Its a good company it just has a huge staffing issuse and the work life balance is not great.

Management was nice, I enjoyed being recognized and appreciated. The hardest part of my job was not being able to open an account for customers that really needed them.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the relaxed atmosphere.  It was professional and easy,  I liked making the customers smile and leave with a better attitude overall.  My co-workers were easy to work with.  I didn't have problems in that area."
good,"pnc bank is a great company to work, good benefits, life and work management, great advancement opportunities. "
good,"Very productive work place that finished each month as one of the top branches in Louisville. Very high volume of customers that we took care of each day and majority of those customers always came back with a smile. I learned a lot about handling large amounts of money and working with older woman with a common goal of being the best bank representatives we could be. I also learned how to increase my abilities as a leader, because many things that needed to be done I would just take care of them myself or contact my manager for help if needed. I loved my co workers! I love working as a team. The hardest part about my job was balancing even at the end of the day, because one small error could throw all the numbers off. And, I most enjoyed coming to work each day, seeing the smiling faces and taking care of the communities banking needs."
good,"PNC was a great decision I made to begin my career in a financial institution. The management is wonderful and helpful in helping learn and perfect all aspects of the daily teller duties. The hardest part of the job is dealing with irate customers. However the training and guidance I have received has allowed me to be able to diffuse any situation I have control over, or if I do not have the ability to solve the problem myself, I know the right procedures to get the customer to the individual who would be able to help them in the most efficient way."
good,At pnc I have had the opportunity to learn and grow with an organization that supports it employees. I have learned to work independently as well as with a team. Management has supported my decisions to move forward with my career both inside PNC and outside the company. I enjoy going to work and learning more from my coworkers and meeting interesting people. The hardest part of my job is adjusting to working for a seven day branch.

good,A typical day at PNC as a Financial Sales Consultant involves providing clients with the best customer service possible. I look for ways to make customers day to day banking easier and more beneficial by reviewing accounts and finding ways to save and make more money. I work with management to improve my skills and to help solve more complicated customer problems. The hardest part of my job is making sales calls everyday. Its not really hard to make the calls but not real enjoyable. The most enjoyable part of my day involves interacting face to face with customers and learning a little bit about their life.

I learned how to manage my fellow employees and came up with ways on how to improve the work pace. The hardest part about my job was being in a production setting, you never know what the day is going to be like. The most enjoyable part was we never had a dull moment at work."

good,"We always were to be at work on time and use our breaks and lunches on time.  "
good,"Overall this is a  great job to grow with. I would recommend going in as a plat form member though. Being a teller means you have the most transaction in the bank. Meaning they constantly set high goals for you to reach.which wouldn't be bad, but they keep making it harder to hit the incentive goal. meaning you don't get the incentive pay. Since i started they have taken 3 things away that would've been a referral for us. meaning now its even hard to hit the goal. also when you are hired on, they say it isn't a sales job, but it really is. They want us to push credit card offers, and that's fine and all, but asking the same person more than once is rude. especially when its not in the customers best interest all the time. We also don't get a lot of new customers in the branch. most of them are older, or have some debt. Generally those customers do not want a new credit card. But we are told to ask and make sure they leave with a hand out.  even if you hit your referral goals, its never good enough.."
good,Great people to work with and help each other in increasing sales by observing each others' conversations with the customers and making suggestions where needed.
good,"Exposed to innovative technology stack. Enterprise is moving towards micro-service, modern architecture. Agile and DevOps cultural changes are getting matured"

good,"its an ok company to work for, pay can be a bit low but it is Pittsburgh, good food at locations no isseus with moving up, lots of support typical day varies"
good,Good place to work at. I dont think tellers should have a lot of stress about selling bank products. And consistently calling and repeatley asking the same customers over and over about a bank product that they already said no to. And diffently not investments. Tellers should be able to go to work not worrying about if they are going to get written up for sales not meet. And not getting a raise because they dodnt meet their goal.

good,Clear focus and commitment on employee development to prepare for next level opportunity and contribution.  Numerous strategies in place to provide a world class customer service and sales experience.
good,"Overall is good, the only thing that I don’t like is the salary. Salary is too poor for the amount of responsibility you have to deal with. Then advancement is possible but they don’t offer you much money to advance you."
good,Enjoyed my time working for the company. Overall good management time and ample on the job training. I only left the company for a better opportunity. It was an opportunity for more growth and ability to make more money.

good,Direct managers are wonderful to work with. My manager takes an active interest in my development with my career and me personally. We are given 40 hours per year paid to do sanctioned volunteer projects. This contributes to a positive work life balance.
good,I loved working for PNC. I was able to learn and grow in different positions. It was challenging but enjoyable. My only issue was the location and the robberies and attempted robberies that happened while I was there. It was difficult to relocate so I had no choice but to leave the company.
good,A busy place to work with wonderful people surrounding you to support you and encourage your success.  Helping customers with their banking needs and helping branch employee be successful is a rewarding experience.
good,Company is good to their employees. Alot of advancement available. work pace is fast. They train well before they place you. A lot of company inclusion.
good,Timeframe for advancement dwindled away over time. New hires would start at same level as senior reps. The most recented promotions were given to rrps with less experience and time with company.
good,"Motivated company with great benefits, compensation and recognition.  Company promotes a good work / life balance, while promoting career advancement within."
good,"Loved working at PNC, they made sure there was a great work life/ home life balance, pay was good, and the atmosphere there was always positive, highly recommended working there"
good,"Very nice company, with great values and goals. Company is trying to find new and innovative ways to do business, but not all of them hep making job easy and productive."
good,Good company great opportunity to advance as long as you do your job. your not micromanaged there and you have good managers there who have positive things to bring to your advancement & help you and look forward to do so. Wish I had not left. Good company!
good,"I work in the Bankruptcy department at PNC, so there's not really a typical day. The reason being, is because no one customer's situation is the same. However, every day is a learning experience. Overall, I find joy in assisting customers in getting there life on track, post bankruptcy."
good,"Good environment if you are an achiever.  Heavy emphasis on sales performance.  Goal always go higher, which given the limited territory, can continue annually."
good,Friendly yet professional work environment.  Everyone is willing to help and willingly communicated.  Wasn't there long but got the impression that there isn't much opportunity for advancement.
good,"PNC is a great to work, pay is not competitive but the work equals the pay. not too diverse, has great core values that I love but was loosely  followed by everybody including management."
good,It was a pleasant place to work from what I can remember. I learn a lot about the banking industry and wouldn't mind working there or in the industry again.
good,"A very agressive sales centered culture. The bank however, does value and stresses a well balanced job work/life balance. While the pay is average if you are able to meet your sales goals the incentive pay is very attractuve. This bank too, values good customer service inspite of their agreesive sales goals."
good,"I enjoy working as a branch Associate because I like helping people and me and my customers connected pretty well. That was confirmed even when my new manger came, customers would declined being service at times in my absence per her when I return from my short leave."
good,Working for PNC Bank was an great opportunity it helped me learn the banking field and work with wonderful people that showed you different parts of the business.
good,"If you value work/life balance PNC is a great place to work.  Compensation levels are below industry norm, but they overcompensate by providing a slow-paced, easy to balance workload."
good,Enjoyed working for PNC Mortgage.  There was opportunity for growth in the company.  I feel that they where very diversified and the workplace culture.
good,acquires and deepens the branch customer base through a variety of proactive sales and service activities. Manages the customer experience by identifying opportunities to improve the customer’s financial wellbeing. Collaborates with ecosystem partners to grow customer’s share of wallet. Positions PNC solutions to drive new revenue and customer loyalty.
good,"The typical day starts with 2nd day maintenance. We go through the previous day numbers and discuss our goals for the day. We review all the documents that come thru our system to open/close accounts, mainly DDA and CDs."
good,I managed a business banking center with high small business clientele. I was able to handle the pressure of sale goals mothly and quarterly. It was very transactional branch.
good,"Work hard and you will be rewarded with easy and quick advancement opportunities. I've had great managers in many different departments that truly cared about your growth and development. As long as you express your interest in advancement, they will get you to where you want to go."
good,"Typical Day is inquiries by customers. You are a problem solver for many, and a familiar face for others. People trust you with their hard earned money, therefore want to understand exactly what is happening (and can happen) to their hard earned finances."
good,It was great working at PNC. Recently they have adopted the Agile framework. I have loved my days of work at PNC. The team has been very supportive. It was fun work environment.
good,"very busy teams"
good,During the time I spend at PNC I was able to learn and develop personal and professional growth that helped me achieved goal at work and personal. Great company to work for.
good,"One of the best things about working at PNC is the opportunity for employees to take on new challenges. This engages employees to search out opportunities to help improve not only themselves, but the company as well."
good,Everyone is always friendly and willing to coach you. There is a huge push towards sales. So that made me uncomfortable at times. For I am not much of a pushy person.
good,"Excellent atmosphere with ability to grow and develop, challenging yet supportive. Wealth of on line classes and courses to learn. Well run organization."
good,I was employed with PNC for about 4 years and would have loved to continue to grow within the company and advance but something happened and I was not able to. However I recommend them as a great place to work.
good,"As a teller I handled basic transactions, withdrawals, deposits, recommended new accounts, and other products.  I built many relationships with the clients, who would wait for me to deal with their transactions and accounts."
good,"As a part-time employee, I was able to gain extensive knowledge of daily banking routines such as balancing drawers, analyzing accounts, and offering products and services to clients. There is some stress involved when it comes to reaching individual goals but working as a team can help tremendously in enjoying the experience."
good,"I have enjoyed being employed with PNC,  I have been employed with the company for 6 years, have a flexible schedule, great management, open door to reach all management levels. This has been like home for me I have much respect for all of my co-workers and hope that I'm able to find another great home due to restructuring of the company."
good,Good reports at the time to work with.  Come in work with bankers to complete loans. Bankers were okay to work with.   Some managers were not friendly with even a good morning. Culture was divided
good,"Nice environment to work in. Management cares about their employees and helps them overcome any issues and succeed."
good,"Great place to work, flexible work schedule, tuition reimbursement, and incentive plan. Offers in-depth training. Would like to see increase in the tuition reimbursement amount."
good,"PNC is a great place to work.  There are definitely heavy volume times, but the team always finds a way to get the work done.  I do feel as volumes increase that PNC should take a better look at staffing appropriately to handle the increases in volume and additional products being launched that also bring in additional volume to the Line of Business."
good,When I was hired I was able to be promoted within a year. I was able to go to several different areas within the bank to grow my career. They have a great process to follow to enable you to be promoted.
good,"I truly enjoyed the culture an work environment, teams worked cohesively together and supported one another.  Management recognized those who achieved and exceeded expectations."
good,"I loved my job with PNC, but was unfortunately displaced after 27 years of employment after an acquisition. They were not helpful at finding me a new opportunity within the company."
good,PNC was very competitive in its price on all products. Focused on only a few industry types which limited its revenue stream.  Works well as a team and immediate supervisor was always accessible.
good,"If you go in and do your job, they will easily move you up. They say you have to wait a year; but I moved up in 6 months, and again in another 6 months. Being at a call center can be stressful, especially inn a banking environment where people blame you for them not having money. Just smile and wave until the end of your shift and until you can get in a role where you do not have to be in front of customers."
good,if it had not turned into just another sales position it would have continued to be a great place to work for.  we were not looking out for our clients best interest but pretending to act like we were
good,PNC prides themselves on great customer service and strive to be the best. They take customer privacy very seriously and are always looking for ways to improve.
good,"Good work environment  - fair management  practices and sales goals "
good,"We used to say we were a technology company, but our current CEO means it. Technology is no longer a cost center or order taker for business. IT must be the business and drive the future. PNC has many IT jobs, allows most IT employees to work from home 2 days a week and allows employees out of our footprint to work remotely."
good,PNC is a nice place to work that all I have I was a contractor and I came in and did my job every day and the people are a good group of people to work with.
good,"Read above. Pretty simple. Pretty much if you came into work and did your job, that's all that was expected of you. However, if you are a minority, you will get promoted fairly quickly as PNC prides themselves on Diversity - It's one of their core principles."
good,I worked at PNC when it merged with Midlantic Bank in the back office and enjoyed the work as it was very challenging.  There was always something to learn and people willing to train you.
good,"Good Company, I was a teller to start, then new accounts.  I left to further my career. "
good,"job was great in management, flexibility, culture and requirements of job. Training was given and it was an overall great job. The only thing is job security was bad."
good,My time at PNC was over 20 years ago.  This gap in time makes my comments about the firm no longer meaningful.  I did enjoy my time there and would recommend it to others.
good,"good company to work for, pay was on a bit low side, management is understanding, people work together well, location I worked at was in suburbs, low customer flow,"
good,Great work place. Great management. Flexible schedule/hours. Can do part time/full time. Good for high school graduates. Many branch locations. Many positions available for advancement.
good,worked in trading room sending wires to buy trades and received wires  in for selling it was nice company to work for  was laid off for down sizing ..
good,"A good place to work, good benefits, bonuses area a plus, good management. potential for advancement and convient location was emplyed there for about 2 years."
good,The banking world has changed so much in the past few years....if you love helping people get to their financial goals than this is for you. The benefits are excellent
good,"I had always heard that if you loved your job, work was easy to handle and coming into work in the morning felt invigorating. I never really believed that until I went to my small rural PNC branch, where everyone treated me like family. I was worked hard, but rewarded for my work and treated well. The benefits are great as well. When I worked there, the pay was significantly less than other banks, but I hear that is currently being changed."
good,i had a great time working for this company. i learned a lot of new things and great work environment. Overall I would recommend this job to anyone because of the room for growth
good,"Dailly interaction with customers, driving sales and understanding products. Very good management process in a very conservative environment. While at times pushing products stressed the working environment, facilitating people with their financial needs provided a satisfying workplace."
good,"pnc was a great company to work for, i did not personally enjoy the work that i did, but everyone was great . if call center work is your jb i would go for it"
good,A very structured culture and opportunities are unlimited. Some of the bureaucracy can lead to slower turn times on loans. Very complicated processing and underwriting system. Which is shifting to a more streamlined approach. Hopefully for the better.
good,Promotes Inclusion and Diversity.  I believe that PNC works hard to be the leader in the industry and wants their employees to thrive in the workplace.
good,Worked in the Trust Department and enjoyed working with my fellow co-workers and work was challenging and fast paced.  I enjoyed this. Great company to work for
good,"At PNC Bank, the sixth-largest bank in the country by assets, customers can earn a $50 sign-up bonus with a checking, savings and money market comboca"
good,I've had the opportunity to learn a lot and advance my career within operations. My manager cares about me as a person and promotes my professional development. I moved to a larger city in my same role so pay is not where I'd want it to be.
good,I love working at PNC it was  great place to work I enjoyed my time there managment was amazin and i would have stayed had it been eady to advance with in the company
good,"Good work environment, good pay, friendly employees, employee discounts, plenty of time off..........................................................."
good,"I have worked in many departments at PNC providing excellent customer service, but the most enjoyable part of the job is to be able to help customer to become financially independent."
good,Good job for someone who likes to be inside all of the time.. I quickly learned that I didn't enjoy looking at the same walls all day. Micro management.
good,Balancing commercial and private accounts. Debiting and crediting accounts accordingly. Providing business and personal services to clients to fit their individual needs
good,"A typical day of work consists of answering phones, originating applications, closing loans and assisting customers with their financial needs as well as their financial goals."
good,"Typical day was waiting on customers and taking loan application opening accounts, Getting loans was the hardest part getting them approved. Worked with tellers to make sure they balanced and to follow all audit procedures. Worked with business partners to obtain new business customers. Workplace culture was good, enjoyed my co-workers and most enjoyable my customers."
good,PNC BANK is a great place to work and advance your career. The salary is way lower what other banks pay but there are opportunities of advancement in reach for all employees. Comfortable work enviorment and structured very well.
good,"Great company to work for, only moved on to make more money.  They tried to match but at that time they couldn't.  Corporate called when I left to let me know that I would always be welcome back."
good,"Nice benefits, co-workers.  I am currently working here.  40 hours per week, incentives.  Plenty of days off and floating holidays, Teledoc system is very helpful."
good,"Jobs there are limited...if you get the chance, take the job."
good,A typical day at PNC is average.  We help the clients that come in by helping them with their financial well being.  We make sure that clients have the best financial needs that will better their future.
good,"I work in a retail branch, which has a high customer traffic volume. I have had the opportunity of handling all aspect of banking because of the traffic volume. I have experience in Investments, Mortgages, Personal Loans, Auto Loans, Monet Market Accounts, CDs, etc."
good,"Jacksonville site is clearly the best. We have great managers, but they are also underpaid. So you lose good people to lesser companies because they pay more. Recently losing our site lead was shocking, but we are doing fine. Id like to see more competitive pay across the board. Incentives are good if you work hard."
good,PNC is a great place to work. The pay and benefits are excellent. The only current negative is that our region is working 6 day works weeks and meeting the sales quotas can be stressful.
good,this was a good company. Besides the low pay it is a perfect job for individuals are content doing this job forever. you have a good chance to travel with this company
good,"You typical day varies greatly depending on  your position there. IF you are customer facing, be aware there ARE sales goals for you to meet. PNC has been working to make itself a more competitive company, pay wise, and has been reinvesting in their current employees. The maternity leave here is GREAT."
good,Great training program. The work atmosphere is friendly and inviting. Managers seem genuinely concerned about your performance and agreadvancement. Opportunities for advancement.
good,I loved my job but I needed more money so I took a banking job in suburbs....Worst move ever. Money does not trump working for  a company you enjoy working for.
good,Great company to start out with and look to advance through out the company. Clients are great but are probably different in south than they are in the north. Management is a shot in the dark because some are great at their jobs and others need some coaching.
good,PNC is a quality employer to begin a career with. It may be challenging to receive market compensation commensurate with job titles as you move up in the company.
good,I did not always know how or when the mail was going to arrive to be processed. It made the daily work flow hard to plan and many days I had to plan on the fly with my team to get the work completed.
good,"decent pay good benefits and great people "
good,"I like the hours that I was working Monday to Friday 9-5. very professional, office was  nice environment, I was able to work in other branches learning more"
good,"I was only part time so I did not get the benefits most got, this was a great company to work for.  There is good training before you take the position and advancement opportunity if desired."
good,"Consistent work place, chances to advance. High turnover rates. Does require some weekends and nights.  Somewhat micromanaged. Overall good place to work."
good,"typical bank hours and the people are great. in charge of opening and closing branch, learned a lot about the financial industry, coming into it completely new; the management was very patient and willing to teach everything to me. I am very grateful."
good,"I come in and pick up my mail, sort it and put it on sharepoint. I have learned different functions and different areas of the bank.We receive quality coaching.Teamwork and always serving the customer."
good,Probably one of the best  ways to make good money if you are willing to put in the time. Biggest skill required is willing to follow instructions. Processing or keying for a full work day.
good,It is a good job for people who work hard. Can be stressful and some managers are better than others. If you don't put in the work you wont make much.
good,PNC is a fast paced financial institution. Work life balance is ok. Management seems to care and will help you to advance in the company. Goals were attainable and you are rewarded for reaching your sales goals.
good,"I enjoyed my time there. I had a great flexible boss-that always helps. I had to relocate due to my husband's job, but I would have stayed a while. Great place that will advance you."
good,Good place to work and good balance with family life. The pay is decent and the management group is awesome. I would love to work here again if a position opens.
good,"Very fast paced environment, with multiple goals to achieve. We worked as a team, supporting each other along the way, but wanting to achieve our goals."
good,"Sales calls, meeting with clients team meeting."
good,Did not like the job. I was clueless on alot of things there. I wish i could have not applied foe the job. Great people to work with awesome hours. Good days
good,probably my most enjoyable job experience as I was at PNC for the longest stint in my career - 8 years.  An rewarding job experience - though my salary was low - I was able to get good incentive bonus pay in bringing new business into the firm.
good,"Fast Past, Competative all the time. Expectations were very high with no real rewards. Loved meeting all my clients. Had many managers while I was employed by PNC. No real leadership that you could connect with and push you along."
good,PNC's a great place to start your career and to get exposure to different lines of businesses (verticals) within the bank. The culture is very relaxed and managers are very understanding.
good,Truly a very challenging and fast pass work environment.   If you are young and energetic this is the place for you.  They teach constantly to keep you abreast of chances in the industry.
good,"she was employee of the month a times, always met or exceeded goals, prompt, always customer aware, product knowledge with client, always trying to make the sale"

good,The benefits were great with this company.  I learned a lot from them and was able to advance my career due to the knowledge obtained with them.  A very secure company.
good,"I was under contract for a Lender Transformation project.  The people I worked with were very knowledgeable and helpful when I needed assistance."
good,"Good place to work, I left because I was recruited by Suntrust and persuaded by salary increase. Mgmt was fair and engaged, I enjoyed working with PNC."
good,I enjoyed learning in depth about your finances and how important it is to budget and pay your bills on time. I love the fact helping other clients manager they're monthly statements.
good,Your experience at PNC is what you make it. Bank owned subsidiaries like PNC Capital Advisors are internally focused sales cultures highly controlled by risk management. It's not Google.
good,"Honestly a great place to work at, company wise. Compensation does need to be a tad more especially in retail banking. You do twice the work and get paid for 1."
good,I would come in at 8am open the branch clock in count the money in the safe and also at my register. I would look at the message board for any up coming promotions or objective for the day. Greet every customer with in the 5Seconds of their arrival  and assist them with anything the might need.
good,Pnc bank cares about its employees. They are easy to schedule around and there are get working enviroment.Pnc has the easy going managment that you can talk to if there is ever a problem they are always willing to help.
good,"I started my career at PNC Bank in 2005 and have been here ever since. It was a great place to work many years ago. "
good,Nice workplace.  Enjoyed working with coworkers.  A typical day is being productive of mailing out the customers packages correct.  The hardest part of the job is trying not to get paper cuts.
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working for PNC. I truly feel like this is a company that cares about their employees. There are always advancement opportunities with this company.
good,"Nothing spectacular, nothing to crazy. Great people to work with. Most of the time it is a relaxed place. Not extremely hard on goals or  sales. Overall great environment to work in."
good,"Wish I was able to be trained for everything that came my way , job was very hard with little to no help , call off by cashier may the job very hard on CSM"
good,"If you want to advance your career, I do not suggest that you work at an in store branch. do yourself a favor and work at a traditional branch."
good,"PNC is full of opportunities for anyone that is willing to work hard and earn them. They offer peak-time, part-time and full time hours, which should work for almost anyone.  The welcome students and work around their schedules. One of the few companies that still matches your 401K deposits, up to 4%, has very good medical benefits at an extremely reasonable cost for full-timers, and also for part-timers. I believe if I were just starting out in the business world, PNC would certainly be on my list."
good,"It was a very good experience to work there. employees are treated farily. Its a fast faced environment, you can be very productive. Extensive training provided for success."
good,"Working at PNC was fun and challenging, but sometimes it got boring and didnt feel like there was room for advancement."
good,"I enjoyed working for pnc, they took care of their employees. i loved working with customers and felt good in helping them reach their financial goals"

good,A great work environment. Family oriented and everyone was very helpful. A great establishment. Many are willing to assist and help whenever needed. Easy to adjust to the work environment.
good,PNC offers great training initially and ongoing. You can learn a lot about banking and customer service and helps you to further your career if you desire. There are many locations in the NJ area.
good,"This is a technology driven company and maintains a well balance between professional and personal life."
good,"fast paced and fun always learning new functions, continued learning process. I have learned a lot about banking in my time here. They care about the employees."
good,NICE manganment. Nice offices. Good compensation.  Good personel. There are areas of oppurtunity.  The branch needs to be given a little more power to make decisions.
good,"A diverse workforce that employees feel valued, respected and proud of the work that is achieved daily. The company creates an environment of teamwork, integrity and quality of life. Great employee benefit packages for employees and great quately incentive plans."
good,Great place to work the atmosphere was good as well as the co-workers. Management really helped out with any questions. The rewards program is awesome.
good,Pnc is a very easy company to work for. the environment is very friendly and fast paced. If you love helping people with their finances Pnc is the place for you!
good,"I really enjoyed myself working here at PNC Bank"
good,"A typical day at work is fast. I verify the income for the underwriters and sometimes have to help in some of the underwriter duties. I verify all types of income from military, retirement, self employed and wage."
good,"As an underwriter, the work life balance is not comparable to larger corporations unless you are hired to work from home which many underwriters do at PNC."
good,"Overall PNC is a great company to work for.  There really isn't a ""typical"" work day which can help to keep you engaged and make you want to keep going.  Management for the most part does what it can to assist you in reaching your goals and ultimately getting where you want to go.  The people are great that you work with and it is one of the things that keeps me coming to work everyday.  The hardest part of the job is working with so many different personalities and working on your employees development while trying to work on your own at the same time."
good,"Processing loan transactions throughout the business day."
good,This was a very nice place to work which allowed me to experience and share many technical issues/problems and solutions.  I was here as a consultant but would love to come back as an employee.
good,This is my first entry level job and it has been a great experience. Great job stability along with compensation for a recent college graduate. Would recommend to anyone wanting to get into finances.
good,My experience was great. This is a great company. They are very informative and detailed in regards to their training. I really enjoyed my time there.
good,Customers were the focus point of the business. I made many great relationships with my customers and enjoyed interacting and servicing their financial needs.
good,The hardest part of the job as with any csr position is handling the irrational customers. Sometimes situations cannot be resolved with only one interaction.
good,This was a great place to earn while in college and also meet leadership from across departments in the bank. At the time we generated the most revenue in the bank. We were a highly prized department.
good,"Not bad if you like big companies.  New talent and job structure is a bit confusing to understand.  Meager annual raises, but improved vacation time off.  Medical insurance seems to be pretty standard and rather affordable.  Can move up or around after one year, but as mentioned, the new structure makes it confusing and can lead to large discrepancies in salaries for the same job"
good,Best job to have while satisfying client needs. But the manager there was very weird and iffy. Always kept asking questions that do not pertain to the job and making a lot of excuses.
good,"Love the work environment a typical day for me was verifying that funding was cleared to be submitted to the following parties. I reviewed all the documentation from the title company and the borrower, buyer and seller."
good,Great place for advancement and great training program. Great for anyone looking to balance work and family life. There are plenty of opportunities to grow and make extra money with overtime and bonus checks.
good,"Have worked at PNC Bank for five years as a Personal Banker ( Branch Sales and Services Associate). Great benefits including 401k, Pension and HSA. "
good,"Great company to work for"
good,i learned a lot about Customer Service. i learned how to different with various personalities while working at PNC.  PNC also offered a lot of opportunities for advancement.
good,"the job was great, regular working hrs. Day or nights hrs will vary btw to shifts 8-5pm or 12-9pm. this job consist on an hourly pay and there is commission involved if production is met. NO HARD PART. unless you dont like talking on the phne. Managements awesome. they are there to help you move forward."
good,"If you work hard, you can advance in your career. Company focuses on Work life Balance and Diversity. Company has a lot of programs and training to assist you in your career development."
good,"PNC is a great company to work for, they have a great management team and your best career interests in mind. Job stability is not particularly high in a constantly changing investment management position."
good,PNC promotes the wellbeing of their employees as a top priority. I've learned a lot from PNC since employment but would like to find more challenging opportunities.
good,"Pros:"
good,"I loved working for PNC, the only reasons I chose to leave was location and lack of advancement in my position. If I could work at PNC here in Texas with a supervisor or managerial position I would leap at the chance."
good,"PNC is a large national commercial bank.  I enjoyed the fact that I was part of a great group in workout and we enjoyed camaraderie.  The bureaucracy could at times be overwhelming.  However, there are substantial opportunities for advancement."
good,"It was great place to work, because location was close to my home. I learned everyone is not going to acknowledge when you do good. Management was not the great. The hardest part of job was not being recognized for a job well done, and most enjoyable part was being able to go home for lunch to spend time with my son."
good,Lovely groups to work with.  Training was done well. Onboarding was done correctly.  Sometimes it was a challenge to get the fund NAVs in before the stock market closed due to the pricing system being late or going down.
good,"Enjoyed working with Tellers and motivating them to reach sales goals.  Enjoyed holidays off. Enjoyed benefits like free bank acct, tuition reimbursement etc"
good,review loans before submitting to title reconcile CD then send to borrower. work off pipeline to determine what needs to be completed for the day

good,"It is a great job, great people to work with and definitely enjoyed my time there. Gave me experience within the realm of banking and business."
good,"This job worked with a variety of computer issues related to PNC's technical infrastructure. Learned how to troubleshoot either using remote assistance or visualization."
good,It was great experience working with the company. I gave me a platform to execute my skills in the apt direction. I could develop both personal life and professional life balance.
good,"Relaxing company, Fair Sales Structure, good compensation. Medical isn't great and the systems constantly crash and are out of date compared to other banks. If you are employed in the south your options for advancement are limited most corporate jobs are in the north."
good,"Loved this job in Gobles, but left due to it closing. The company itself is okay. Lots of pressure in cross selling. It was hard to do the pnc conversations to there satisfaction."
good,what should i say after an year it was afterall the experience that mattered the most.Make some memories and learn new things.
good,"I've worked for other lockbox companies and none compare to PNC. Fair, positive, laid back environment. No micro managing, at least on my shift. Incentive program is awesome! It is production driven so the more you produce the more you make. Starting salary could be a better though."
good,"My working environment was awsome and we where all like family at my branch. Because I was there for some  time I got to know the customers, their wants and needs."
good,I love my branch and I love my manager. I just don't agree in the direction that the company is headed towards. If you would like to know more you can definitely ask me.
good,i had an opportunity of learning many new things.the work environment was really good.it has been busy learning all the time
good,"Good break room and I loved walking around the job, helped me maintain a good healthy lifestyle as opposed to sitting behind a desk all the time. I was the most fit at this job then any other job I've had."
good,"Balance debits and credits on client accounts, research client atm transactions if there was an issue. liaison between clients and bank branches. Looked through atm tapes and client statements to rectify any errors."
good,It was a challenging position very demanding but not really compensated in the same level. Employees are just a number and the was not training or career advancement.
good,PNC Bank is an excellent employer.  They offer a host of products to suit the growing needs of both the individual consumer and the large corporate customers.
good,"Distributing and collecting mail, stock floor orders; handle inquiries from PNC employees; provide office support; answer incoming calls and perform data entry. It is a lot of walking and you must have good memory."
good,"As a Lead/Project Manager I have to monitor workflow, do all reporting, head meetings, and put out the day to day fires. It takes great organizational and time management skills. "
good,Great company and culture.  Benefits are pretty good if you take advantage of what is offered.  Work load is high and pace of everything is fast.  A lot of turnover/transition can further heighten stress.

good,"I was responsible for managing a group of 12-18 consultants that serviced customers on a daily basis. The group that I managed specialized in loan servicing. Essentially servicing and providing insight on  all the lending instruments provided by the bank with the exception of first mortgages. I have learned a lot about the banking industry during my time with PNC. Both within my area and across different departments. I would say the most enjoyable portion of working with the customers is helping to find products that best fit their individual needs and then making certain they understand any pitfalls or potential nuances they may encounter. On the other hand, not all customers choose to follow the right path and sometimes get into products or services that do no best represent their needs and can cause high levels of frustration for our clients. Which in turn is reflected in our conversations. This is not one of the more enjoyable aspects, but it does provide the opportunity to turn the business around and perhaps even secure a greater wallet share.  "

good,Overall GREAT company. The challenge is with newly acquired markets.
good,PNC is a major employer in the Pittsburgh area. There is a lot of room for growth and advancement and they offer a competitive compensation package.
good,A typical day would be having a morning huddle to make plans on how to achieve monthly goals. Discuss a schedule for all team members for lunch breaks and Lobby management.
good,overall it been a great experience. I started as a teller and made to universal branch specialist/ assistant manager in a universal branch withing 4 years.
good,"I may be the wrong person to ask about this, because I am actively seeking to leave employment with PNC, although they have been good to me and I have made many meaningful connections and have learned so much in my time there, I have grown the need to seek change."
good,A typical day at work is good. I learned different cross functions in groups and teams. Workplace culture is good. The hardest part of the job working with different personalities.

good,"The hardest thing about working in a branch is that every branch entirely depends on its manager. If the manager is out of sorts, the entire branch will be as well. I have worked in several branches with both good, attentive managers and also extremely poor, callas managers. Every workplace will have its issues, and professionalism should always come first. You should never see your manager and teller lead arguing over how to do lunches and yelling in front of customers threatening to quit the job. I have seen fantastic, helpful managers make sure that every employee knows how to do their job and willingly answer any question they have. I have seen managers treat employees like they're stupid for asking a question. The job culture and what PNC represents is a wonderful product and theme. They truly do want to do good by the customer and expect their employees to always do the right thing. As long as you've done your research into a branch, you can have an amazing work experience and enjoy coming to work everyday to see your friends/co-workers."
good,PNC is a great company to work for. Conservative bank. Main issue being products are not very competitive. Customers/clients can usually find better deals elsewhere.

good,"PNC is a ever-changing banking environment that leaves much room for growth opportunities. The company is still young while also well established which can cause difficulty, yet it provides a unique template for learning and gaining experience."
good,Not paid quite as high as some other banks. Benefits may be better or at least comparable. PNC will NEVER fire an employee for lack of sales. Be prepared to endure a ton of micromanaged behavioral activities.
good,Get licensed. It was a fun place to work as a young person out of college but it was best used as a launching pad for where I really wanted to go. The salaries are low for the amount of revenue they generate.
good,"Policies and Procedures are impossible to fully comprehend as they are taught as you go with the try and fail approach. Training is mediocre and once again, as you go, however, the manager won't have the time to be the one to train you. Turnover is fairly high. Upper management will be in your branch all of the time if you are not hitting the numbers they want. Pay is decent compared to other banks. Benefits included are healthcare, including dental and vision if desired, 3 weeks of vacation (1 of which must be used all together), 6 sick days, 1 Personal day, 401k, pension plan, decent maternity leave. Typically may work 1-2 Saturdays per quarter. Work day is 8:30am-5:30pm with 1 hour lunch. If you don't like sales, it is not for you."
good,I loved my job because it aloowed me a set schedule for my family when I first started. Im not a sales pusher and it seems that that's the way the company is going even though they try to change the wording of the things they ask or require to seem less pushy
good,Take payments from Borrowers  and apply  to accounts. Send out letters to Borrower for documents needed. Called attorney to see if borrower can be put on payment plan and up date attorney on account. Talked to borrowers to give  up date on loan and answer any questions they might have.
good,Great place to work.Great co-workers and management team. Excellent benefit package.  Many bank branches thruout the
good,Meet alot of new people and had many different positions there. I have seen alot of changes also. To make and maintain the company  compliance wirh state and federal government
good,"Many complaints within the company from the top down. Upper management complains about processes, systems, overall strategy of PNC. Managers, Bankers and tellers are mostly unsatisfied with their jobs and salary."
good,"Worked here for several years and loved the team I worked with. They are so tight knit as a team. I enjoyed this job very much and had we not moved away, would still likely be there"
good,"my current manager is amazing, however the pay just isn't there for the amount of work we're required to do. I love that I have the option to work at home, however."
good,"My branch was very relaxed and was a younger branch. It was very easy to be-friend coworkers and the manager understood a younger mindset. The customers were positive for the most part and as long as you were careful with your drawer and followed the basic safety measures, the job was easy."
good,"I hate call centers, but as far as they go, PNC is a good one to work for.  I truly feel that this is a company that cares about its workers.  They are very accommodating for many different life events."
good,A great place to work.  Pay is good and people are friendly.  I have learned a lot in all different areas of banking from each department I have worked in.
good,"PNC offers ok benefits, but really benefit in the environment.  I feel that the environment is great for creativity and motivation.  Management creates a collective group effort."
good,"balanced day, sometimes busy, sometimes not. the compay employees great people. I learned a lot while i was there. I'd recommend this company to anyone who asked about it."
good,I happened to luck out and my immediate manager was great but I think a lot of if you like PNC or not depends on this. It is a sales position so you have to like talking to people. PNC takes work/life balance very seriously and makes sure you have the time available to you.
good,PNC now gives you 3 weeks of paid vacations and floating holidays. My manager happens to be one of the best managers I've ever had. He loves to motivate you and show you ways on earning more money!
good,"very fasted paced, you must have good customer service skills, be able to multi- task, be willing to sale & refer products& service to clients. Need to proficient with technology"
good,PNC is a very good company to work. I would recommend this to anyone. I like the work culture and the management. I am able to balance both my personal and work life.
good,Great culture and environment. They have a great culture where you can advance in the company. The salary was the only reason why I left PNC. There was a 10% cap on advancing in the company. I am a college graduate and deserve much more to live comfortably.
good,As a student this was the perfect opportunity for me. I was able to make more than minimum wage and provide for myself. This is also a fantastic place for people that have families as well.
good,"I was mostly involved in my daily work like Conducting JAD Session, Attending meetings( Walkthrough, Retrospective), Making BRD, FRD. Data Mapping using MS Visio."
good,"I enjoyed working for PNC Mortgage. Had great management, team environment, and I felt they were very understanding of work and family life balance. Can be stressful sometimes, but overall, great place to work."
good,"PNC is a great company to work for. This has been my first ""adult"" job starting out and the tools they give you to learn the material is fantastic. A typical day at work starts at 8:30am and if you close, ends at about 5:45/6PM. Management is fabulous and how the branches come together as a team is fantastic."
good,"Good Company but just like most institutions very sales driven. Good work / life balance and ""Bankers Hours"".  Good for family life but there is an expectation of production."
good,The team you join becomes a family. The people are great. My particular team lead was understanding and easy going.  They are pretty fair with pay and your experience.  You get raises on time. Work is steady but at peak season you will be very busy. Pretty good place to work
good,Hated all the sales goals/requirements. Many of them (QIAs) are very difficult to get. I felt much more like a sales person/telemarketer than a banker.
good,Moved up and around within company very easily. supportive supervisors that are willing to help you advance. Most departments offer a competitive commission based pay option.
good,"It was typical, great to learn many new things. We used some new technologies. Management and co-workers or good to be be work with."
good,Friendly and professional atmosphere...great working as a team environment..wide variety of customer contacts...ability to do what you do best every day
good,Typical banking environment. Get to meet a lot of people. Goals are constantly changing. Cannot keep up with management. The co-workers make going into work everyday a favorable experience. Hardest part of the job depends on what location you're working in. Customers make your job harder. The pay could definitely be better and management cold be more structured.
good,"Work environment a little stressful"
good,"It was a great place to work."
good,"Great corporate culture and stable, though hard to advance once inside due to a very poor pay band structure that favors outside talent over inside talent."
good,"I learned a lot. There's opportunities to grow and get promoted. The hours were excellent in-store honestly. I loved my shifts. I performed very well, so management really encouraged and helped me grow even more."
good,"I had gotten the opportunity to listen in on the more experienced co workers with the customers. I learned a tremendous amount of not only customer service but, seeking the best for the customer. Hardest  part of the job was i felt as if i was pushing product onto the customer more than seeking what best to fit there needs.."
good,"PNC is a good company. On par with many other companies in terms of compensation, benefits, etc. They are loyal to their employees which is a good thing. Favoritism can play a role in promotion and management, but if you stick with it you can advance fairly easily (if you work hard and are competent). Technology is so-so and they like to think they are on the front of trends, but really seem to be in the middle of the pack."
good,its a good company to use our skills and work development.all collegues are good to be a team player .management is cooperative with all team leads and members.
good,"A typical day at work consist of opening the branch and setting up an interactive activity to attract customers. This position can be a lot of fun if you are grouped with the right set of co- workers. The most enjoyable part of the job is the interactions with customers and being paid to be a part of games from time to time. However, the hardest part of the job is meeting monthly sales goals from time to time."
good,"I've been working for PNC Bank for a little over 12 years. I can honestly say that I do not have any negative feedback to report.I come to work daily to a good working atmosphere. At 6 AM I run my daily totals reports. Next I began logging in work for a team of 35 Statement Spreaders, then I log out all of their completed work and finally I take a look at supplies that may e running low and make sure our printers and faxes are working properly. I have a great relationship with my manager and my coworkers. In fact, my manager knows that I am looking for employment outside of PNC Bank because our opportunities for advancement aren't as high as they use to be in previous years. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to come in at 6 AM because I get to leave at 2:30 PM which lets me schedule all of my appointments for after I leave work.   I also enjoy the conversations I have with the diverse people in our group."
good,I enjoyed the interaction between myself and the guests. They were friendly and I had a great teller supervisor and general manager. I would definitely recommend this position to anyone.
good,It was a great place for me to gain many of the customer service skills I still use today. The culture feels like family and there is ample opportunity to grow and expand your future due to the company's size.
good,Great place to work and is really there for their employees when needed. Great work environment and will work with you to help you understand and to perfect your skills for the job.
good,A typical day at work is filled with smiling faces and employees ready to assist customers. I learned the banking system and how to identify a financial need and/or benefitfor clients. The most enjoyable part is the customers and getting to know them financially and personally. The hardest part is closing every night and working every Saturday.
good,Great company to work for! Very low compensation! Turnover rate seems high especially at the entry level positions. A lot of job opportunities throughout the company
good,"Foot traffic in banks is slowing down as online banking becomes more popular, so it was a bit slow working in the actual branch. Customers were generally very friendly, co-workers as well. Management...well it depends on who you count. My direct supervisor was a bit passive aggressive and rude, very loud and intimidating. Her superiors were very nice, and very understanding of my scheduling needs and availability. I guess depending on the location, you may either sit at your computer scrolling through the same news feeds day after day, or you may be on your feet running back and forth for hours. Hour long lunch breaks, VERY nice. Shifts were reasonable, and it was fantastic to have every sunday and most of saturday off. The hardest part of the job was training, considering it was 55 miles one way to get there and lasted about 6 days. Miles were compensated, no issues or hassle there."
good,"good culture, respectable management, considerable training available, but company is like a training ground for other firms.  PNC takes great effort in hiring and training good people but seems to have a difficult time retaining talent because they refuse to pay at a competitive level."
good,"PNC was very good with training specific to  a SPOC's role and Freddie and Fannie Mae guidelines. Management was very sensitive to any personal or professional needs that may affect your performance and always maintained an open door policy. "
good,I would highly recommend someone new to this Organization great! for starters good management team we have deadline on a daily basis we have huddles to make day go smoothly the hardest is being one team one shop one goal sometimes
good,Easy to take trascations from customers. Easy environment to learn from. Opening and closing accounts. Helping customers with their everyday money management. Balancing cash drawers at the end of the day.
good,This was my first job.  It taught me a lot about work ethic and focus.  I became close friends with all of my co-workers and I would go back if I could.
good,"PNC is a good place to work. Management has always been top quality, they do seem to care about you as a person. The pay could be better. The goal are very difficult to reach."
good,"Logged on to work /underwrote FHA & conventional files"
good,PNC was a very fast paced and energetic company. A typical work day included inbound calls from insurance agents and customers inquiring about loan status. We would then have a team meeting to review work stats from the day before and set daily goals for ourselves.  We would also update the team with any changes within the company/systems.  From there we would work directly with underwriters to process loan applications and assure that all the required documents were received. The many tasks that were involved in the loan process included over 52 daily activities for my team.
good,PNC is a great place to work with a continued emphasis on employee engagement and career advancement.
good,PNC (fka National City) provides one with the opportunity to excel in various areas if you show initiative.  I was able to use my ability to communicate and analyze data plus decision making to promote into other areas of interest and need.  Co-workers are generally very conscientious and aid in building a very good work environment.
good,Pnc is a great place to work and bank. The job is very diverse with lot of room to grow and learn.  Each day is not like the last one.  Employees are pleasant and willing to help.  I enjoyed each day worked there. There was nothing hard about my day
good,PNC Mortgage has a good management team and a great understanding of the market. They stay on top of new products and programs and provide a lot of support for their loan officers.
good,"At PNC we provided all financial services to Customers, from Retail Banking needs, to Mortgage and loan services, etc."
good,"Sending car titles to either customers,  insurance companies, credit unions, or dealerships once the loan has been paid in full."
good,"Excellent management. Good, hard-working employees. Opportunity to earn valuable and insightful financial tools that can be both used in and out of the workplace. "
good,"Wonderful hours, very structured day.  Nice customers and coworkers."
good,similar work culture as fedex. very organized when coming to planing and distribution of work among the team mates.
good,PNC was good place to work for and seems to care about it's employees.
good,A typical day at work was at least a steady flow of people who came in the lobby or through the drive thru. I have learned quite a lot from the clients and coworkers at PNC. My coworkers were friendly and helped me out when I had any questions. Hardest part of the job would be dealing with clients who had a bad customer service experience and try helping them come to a solution to their problem or frustraion.
good,"Depending on the schedule that was always changing based on having a staffing issue, some days I would open the branch but usually i would always close. My manager was fantastic but my supervisor had communication issues with explaining scheduling conflicts. My coworkers were a joy to work with and they really made the transition from one banking atmosphere to another very smooth. The hardest part of the job was being treated the way i was by my supervisor. She acted as if i was completely new to banking instead of acknowledging that i had been doing that job for 7 years. The most enjoyable part of the job was bonding with my coworkers and getting to know the customers so as to gauge their banking needs."
good,I really enjoyed PNC. The message is great. Great benefits. They do care about their customers. They're trying to do more!
good,The job itself is pretty easy. The best things about working there are meeting new people and helping customers. 
good,training was a week long and very thorough. mileage reimbursement for training and awesome benefits.
good,I mostly enjoyed working with a team of seasoned professionals in the banking industry. 
good,"data entry extreme sitting, process claims medical bills. working second shift 330p-12am"
good,High risk environment allows for risk assessment skills and judgment. The ability to accept responsibility and take control of customer issues is important.
good,"The typical day at PNC Bank, was very family oriented. Constantly being informed about the changes that were occurring in the financial world and constantly in class to better you in your job. OUstanding management team that cares about your well-being and making sure that you balance work and home. The best part of the job was being able to discuss your work with other employees to get there perspective of what they would do differently."
good,"A typical day at work includes coaching and development. Handle routine financial transactions (deposits, withdrawals, advances, loan payments, merchant transactions etc.), and balances these transactions daily while ensuring a positive interaction with customers and non-customers"
good,The values of the company are strong and there is a desire to meet customer's needs and exceed expectations.
good,"overall was a friendly, efficient, professional place to work"
good,"My time spent at PNC Bank was a learning experience, not only for the customers, but also for myself in understanding my banking and the benefits to each accounts offered. The most enjoyable part of my job was the relationships I was able to establish with consumers that came into our facility on a daily and/or weekly basis. The hardest part of my job was having to handle technical difficulties as they occurred during the day, these were far and few between, but caused a decrease in our efficiency when they did occur."
good,PNC is a great place to work for someone interested in a long-term banking career. New branches are being built rapidly and customers continue to use PNC Bank to meet their financial needs.
good,It as a great place to get your foot in the door for basic customer service skills.
good,Hours are amazing and are more flexiable than standard retail hours.
good,"The branch I managed was moderately busy. The typical day began with me checking my e-mail and reviewing my ""must do"" list. On days that I opened the branch, I arrived at 8:30 AM, and opened the doors for business at 8:55AM (our market manager urged that we try to open the branch 5 minutes early). As a Financial Sales Consultant III, I was responsible for achieving and surpassing company issued sales goals through direct sales, cold-calling, and establishing off-site opportunities. In addition to the sales aspect of my position, I also had an active role in managing the branch. The management aspect of my job included: training and developing our tellers and CSA, assisting the branch manager in establishing our annual budget, handling escalated issues, and loss avoidance."
good,PNC was a had a great work/life balance plan. They cared about their employees and making sure they had time for their families.
good,"The job was hard at first, but then after a week of training and being supervised, I learned how to work a 10-key numeric machine. If work was not done, co-workers would help others if no others checks were left."
good,My manager and co-workers are the best I have ever worked with. PNC offers nice benefits and is really good about encouraging a nice work/ life balance. The only downside is that the entry level pay is lower than any of the other banks in my area.
good,Co-workers were pleasant. Atmosphere was good. Customers were always friendly. I've learned to be more detailed in things I do.
good,"Washington Mutual bought out PNC. I really enjoyed working for them. Management was very good, everyone helped everyone and the work was completed."
good,"Was a great company to work for, would recomend. Pay was good for area. Would have given 5, but managment a little slow on getting things done for employees. Advancement is done by work performance not time with company, which was great for me!"
good,"This company will support you in your endeavors with things like tuition reimbursement and paid job training. PNC promotes being a team player with quarterly employee surveys, spot light awards which can be redeemed for various types of gifts, and weekly one on one meetings. In my area of the market PNC also has biannual sales rallies where employees are recognized for their achievments."
good,The culture at PNC is inviting and collaborative. Great teams to work with to help meet the needs of the client and flexibile work life balance. The bank is expanding as well.
good,"The pay is adequate, the benefits package is better. The corporate culture is supportive and pushes employees to pursue advancement within the company.  The branches however, lacked staffing making it difficult to complete any job duties."
good,"You're given 15 minutes before actually required to take a call, this gives employees time to catch up on important company alerts and communications. Though there are productivity measures that seem to be priority in each meeting, they also explain the importance of taking a break and getting time to mentally recharge. "
good,Great environment to work. Recommend working here for YOUNGER PEOPLE (18-26) . Flexible hours. Really great long term job for younger people. Learning about banking.
good,I loved my position at PNC. I miss it alot!  But family took priority.  So unfortunately I had to leave after nearly 11 years.   I loved my coworkers!
good,Work culture is awesome! Co-workers tend to have good tendencies. ... PNC has been known to be one of the lowest paying banks in the industry and this has caused a higher turnover accompanied by lower morale.
good,I loved my job with PNC. The company seems to truly care about their employees. There is a lot of room for advancement as long as you’re willing to move to another branch. A requirement is that you must be really good at sales. The job is basically a sales job and pushing products - you have to be good at that or you won’t make it. I did very well with the sales aspect. I only left PNC for a better opportunity with another company.
good,"Been here for 21 years and appreciate the people I work with. Five weeks paid time off, 3 days work from home.. I'm content and hope to retire here. The offices are nice , especially the cafeteria."
good,"Atypical day off tax season was working to improve the departments functions, procedures and process to create a more efficient environment and to mitigate risk and provide consistency throughout the department.  During tax season it was 6-7 days a week making sure all of the processes where working properly to ensure we could meet all tax deadlines.The culture on my team was one of openness and sharing of ideas to create better processes.  The hardest part was making sure the department could meet the strict tax deadlines both internally and the ones placed by the taxing authorities.  The most enjoyable part was being part of the leadership team and being able to affect positive change for efficiencies cost savings and mentoring other staff and problem solving issues."
good,"I had tremendous professional encouragement to learn, work and grow having multiple and helpful resources. I worked on the technical and business side within Treasury Management. Was promoted twice in two years (which is unheard of) but I worked diligently, followed the process and networked across the bank. Benefits are tremendous, pay could have been better. Don't hesitate to apply."
good,"Enjoyed working there.  Training was not as relevant as It should have been.  Some of the parts of everyday"
good,If you are looking for a job that is very specific in time then PNC is a great 9 to 5p with possibly extra hours on Sat. if needed. Never a full day always 9a to 2p.
good,It was a great job overall. Not particularly easy or hard. Customers could be challenging. The team at the branch was the best part of it all. Would have stayed longer if it wasn't for a personal change.
good,PNC Bank is a good place to work. The management on the Mortgage side is very responsive and helpful. They provide all the support you need to be successful.
good,PNC is a nice place to work. As a teller you're able to relax a little in between customers while not having too much down time that things get boring.
good,"Over all a good company to work for.  They could learn from employees coming from other banking institutions or work fields and do a better job in training products and company software applications.  Some management were absolutely amazing and I was fortunate to have two excellent managers my last few months with PNC, however some managers were very lackluster and either did not care if they performed their job well or played favorites and did not assist in the advancement of other employees within their branch.  The benefits and paid time off were wonderful and I would recommend PNC to other for career opportunities."
good,"PNC is a great place to advance your career in a number of fields. Having held numerous positions, I have had the opportunity to hone my sales, analytical, and management skills."
good,"Worked with a 3rd party supplier that supplied services very similar to Bizbang.(company that I am interested in working for)"
good,Great management team.  Well inducted training crew.  Customer ervice is exceptional and team building instilled.  Would recommend this company for anyone wanting to go into the financial sector.
good,"At my branch, was a normal job, as in most banks there is pressure for sales, but my experience there was pleasant. customers and coworkers are very friendly"
good,"Though it can sometimes be taxing or stressful to keep track of everything that you need to do, overall it was a decent place to work. Nights, weekends, and holidays off are a great perk. In addition to that, you get great benefits. Didn't really like calling customers to try to sell them on meetings, to then try to sell them on products or services. The sales goals tended to make things somewhat stressful. "
good,"Don’t intend on leaving unless, something much better is presented in front of me. Very nice place to work. They do have expectations, but I was always one to have goals and to want to reach them. The bank does have changes from time to time and I believe they do keep up with the competitors. If I do ever switch institutions in my career idk if I will ever close my account there. Great company overall. But you do need to understand they do have goals and expect you to serve the customers by meeting those goals."
good,Typical day at work includes a fair amount of customer contact and reaching out to customers. I learned a fair amount about the financial industry working with PNC.
good,"PNC overall I think is a really great company to work for. We have great benefits offered to us which I think are competitive with other employees. Raises are semi-annually to yearly depending upon performance. PNC does not offer overtime, which allows for a healthy work/life balance. Full time employees are offer paid vacation plus the benefits of health, vision, dental, retirement and more"
good,"A typical day at work for me consisted of being on the phones with my customers internal and external.  I learned about the home preservation programs which were created to assist customers with staying in their homes. My Manager was extremely knowledgeable about the Mortgage loan servicing process and investor guidelines."
good,"This job offers great benefits and a lot of advancement opportunities. The pay is great , even as a part time employee I had full time hours. The hours are fixed so you always know which hours your working."
good,"meet all requirements of the job "
good,"PNC taught me a lot about the financing world that I still use on an everyday basis. Unfortunately, because of the 9 to 5 business hours, it was tough to schedule school."
good,"I worked here through college and it was great. The hours were flexible allowing me to go to school full time and work over 30 hours/week. My managers and supervisors were always great and understanding of my work/ school balance. When I decided to become full time, after college, they gave me the hours."
good,This is a great place to work if you can deal with the stress of being in charge of other people's money.  they have a fast work environment but a great balance to work life sue to their time off policies.
good,I learned a lot in my time at PNC for that I will forever be grateful. I rose in the ranks quickly through hard work and dedication. I would definitely return if it was possible. My co workers were the best ever.
good,"Though short-lived, I enjoyed my time at PNC. While it is a fast-paced environment full of multi-tasking, my role was well-supported by management. Adequate training was provided."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at PNC. It was a good environment to work, Management was great, pay was ok.  I come from a back ground of credit, at PNC I learned a lot about the retail side. The hardest part of the job was explaining fees and the repetition of the calls."
good,"Long tenure at this company...Hard work is rewarded.  Good, solid management team across the board.  Good community recognition and support.  Diverse."
good,"I've never worked for a company that gives weekends off so that right off the bat is a positive thing for me.  You can't beat bankers hours or all the paid holidays.  The benefits and days off are great, I think personally that for what they are asking me to do in my position that they are underpaying for what the job requires, but it's a trade off with all the benefits. A great work life balance is something that I've always wanted in a job and now I have it so that is a great thing."
good,"Everyone knows everyone. It's competitive, but fun. The sales goals can be stressful depending on your location. Customer traffic and demeanor are big factors, so sales excellence is a must."
good,"PNC Bank is a great company to work for. PNC offers amazing benefits, good hours, great coworkers, and a lot more. I learned great customer service skills, conducting sales calls, and money management. I enjoyed being able to learn about the banking industry and travel a lot within the region to help out other branches while meeting a lot of good hard-working people. Hardest part of the job was adapting to a lot of change from software to new employees/managers every so often. Overall, PNC Bank taught me a lot skills and I believe it is a great stepping stone that will lead to better opportunities."
good,"Love my coworkers and the clientele but the income is not enough to sustain myself and children, as a single income household.  There is room for advancement and great benefits."
good,I came into banking with no experience and have learned so much in my 2 years here. I would like to move to the underwriting side of banking but unfortunately that would be relocating to a different state.
good,"While in college, this was an ideal job. The flexible scheduling mixed with the busy workplace was productive. However, despite popular belief, this job is predominantly sales. Goals are set high and are difficult to meet unless you really know how to talk. You have to be willing to learn, as the coaching is there. I would only recommend to those who are willing to learn to strategically sell - and you must be a people person."
good,"Productive workplace with very good management. Stressful at times, but the management makes sure that you are trained properly and if you need help they are more than happy to step in and help."
good,PNC is an incredible company with immense benefits and competitive salaries.  There is no lack towards investing into technology as well as their employees.  I would recommend this company to anyone.
good,"PNC Bank was an exceptional place to work. Putting our customer needs to the fore front during the day was self rewarding. Knowing that I meet and exceeded my customers need reflected in my reviews, however every day came with a new challenge which caused me to dig deeper to rectify our clients problems. Of course the paid vacation days and paid floating holidays made my job less stressful knowing I had the time to spend with family and take care of personal business."
good,in this company i were work very hard and daily work is typical .i learned a lot of knowledge about work of construction and how to management the work and work in decipline . the envoiurment of that company is very good and very cultural.and this is the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"PNC is a strong employer to work for. What you put into it, is what you will get out of it. Hard work is rewarded. Advancement is available to those who seek it."
good,"Enjoyed working for the company overall. Company takes care of their employees.  Excellent balance for work and family life.  Incentives, bonuses, raises."
good,PNC has developed a great culture of balancing work and personal home life. PNC is striving to be the leader of technology and financial services and is evolving rapidly. One must be ready to acclimate to an evolving environment and effectively lead the changes with their respective teams.
good,"A typical day at work starts by reviewing my email inbox and checking my voicemails. After that, I determine what pressing issues need addressed and prioritize my work. I have learned an extensive amount about loans, lines of credits, trusts, estates, and wills. I have dealt directly with clients and internal employees."
good,Working with customers to ensure they have an exceptional experience brings me great joy. This position has enabled me to grow and develop new skills.
good,"12-14 hour days in PNC's Securitization group"
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working at PNC Mortgage, but there was no room for advancement for me there.  My co-workers were intelligent people who were kind and so much fun.  My Operations Manager was awesome."
good,"I worked there for 3 years and had great opportunity for advancement. Management was a bit lacking at the time. Overall, decent company and has great benefits."
good,I have enjoyed working for PNC for four years.  I like the people I work with and the company culture is great.  The pay (at least at the branch level) is not
good,I work from 8am to 4:30pm EST.  I spend most of my day reviewing applications and calling customers advising of our loan process.
good,"Management is great, lots of space for promotion. Great benefits, 3 weeks vacation, paid sick time. You are able to interact with a great range of individuals from all walks of life"
good,"Everyday has a new challenge and lots of variety. The dynamic culture of this company allows me to develop outstanding customer service skills, learn how to communicate and how to manage & deal with change.  The most enjoyable part of this job is providing individual customer service and making a positive impact to them personally."
good,I love my job and my coworkers. Great opportunity for development that provides a great quality of life. I would love to retire at PNC Bank but I also would like to move to another state. I hope PNC moves to the state that I would like to move to.
good,"Life / work balance is a concern for the company and they work with their employees to achieve their needs."
good,"Over the period of close to two years, PNC have given me the opportunity of learning many things related to the financial services such as: how to handle clients and how to address their individual financial needs."
good,"It's a great place to work,  there's still a lot of room for improvement especially in the technology field but it's a bank with great values and a friendly work environment"
good,The best part of my job is to help the sales team and customer in making sure the services that the customer has request to be setup are accomplished in a timely manner.  I enjoy making both internal and external happy.
good,"Fast paced environment, constantly learning new functions and supports various product groups to help service the customer in a timely manner.  Primarily responsible for servicing corporate clients and business clients that have Treasury Management products.  The management team is very supportive and provides a monthly review of your job performance. Co-workers are great and really live up to the word team player.  The hardest part of the job would be keeping up with the influx of calls that ""roll over"" to the department, but self-rewarding when you take ownership of the call to service the customer.  The most enjoyable part of the job is providing exceptional customer service to the external customer and or the internal service partner. Overall,  the company is growing and offers a lot to their employees."
good,"Working for a busy branch and due to our location it makes it less challenging to meet our goals. "
good,"Going to work everyday was a joy for me. Not only did I love what I did, but I loved being able to help others and not just myself on a daily basis. The hardest part of my job would of have to be that sometimes you have to accept the fact that you cannot help everybody. Sometimes there are things out of your control in life and you just have to accept that fact. The most enjoyable part of my job working as a customer service representative was that when I was able to help others I was not only helping them, but I was supporting there decisions and making sure that they knew that when something went wrong that I was there to help them the best that I could. Also, I loved working there because you could help people plan for their futures. Far and wide. You could help people. Even around the world. You will never see them or talk to them again after that call ends, but in the end you knew that you helped that person the best that you could."
good,"Work was enjoyable, except company/management wont sponsor visa for even highly qualified foreign associates."
good,Busy day.  Always active.  Good learning enviornment.  Policy and procedure work enviornment.  Communication is very important.  Hardest part of the job is balancing your task with customer demands which change daily.
good,"Customer Service 24/7, new product knowledge everyday. Came into this job not knowing all too much about banking what so ever. Now I know so much in a short period of time thanks to their training, and knowledgeable co-workers."
good,"A typical day at PNC Bank entailed arriving to work on time, making sure all opening procedures were followed, and always beginning your day with a second associate. We made sure the branch was opened on time and always helped customers with a smile on our faces and assisted them with any issues they had with their accounts. I learned a lot about the bank setting and how to handle cash, and maintain the operations side of the bank in order. I managed three tellers under my supervision and assigned them personal goals to ensure the branch achieved their monthly goals. The hardest part of my job was learning how to work in a bank setting, being that it was my first job at a bank. The most enjoyable part was being a part part of a branch that consistently achieved their monthly goals."
good,"Some days we are very busy with customers and other days not so much.  I act as a teller and a customer service rep.  Both areas are very demanding.  As a teller I would take in cash deposits and also disperse money.  I also open accounts, credit cards, and help customers with their existing accounts to make sure that they are in the best account that will make the most money for them."
good,I've worked for PNC for years and they are successful by doing what's in our clients best interest. They do not product push and goals are attainable. Culture is fun and you build relationships with co-workers. The only con I have about PNC is their compensation to loyal and long standing team members.
good,"Great location to work in Millburn NJ, working with customers offering bank products and non traditional products was quite the  experience."
good,Enjoyed my time working there. The benefits were decent and so was the pay for a teller position.

good,A typical day was to process customer requests regarding issue's with the PNC Points program.
good,"PNC is a very good company to work for. The benefits are outstanding. There is room for advancement as long as you apply yourself. They are very strict on inherence, talk time, and tardiness. Quality customer service."
good,It is very customer oriented and is very employee supportive.
good,"I guess my experience was different than the rest. I have an awesome group of coworkers that became a second family to me. 0010745 was the best decision for me! The manager made sure I was always trying to reach my goals! My coworkers weren’t only worried about my work life, but also worried about my personal life. I think we all grew together, while employed there.  I would recommend my hoem beach to anyone!"
good,"You could andvance in your career very quickly, they always want you to succeed. They are team players. They pay fairly and the managers will have meetings throughout the month to see what it is you want to do and put you on the path."
good,The company truly pursues a healthy work environment culture that allows internal growth within the firm as well as a strong work life balance. The employees are friendly and are enjoyable to work with.
good,"Loved working part time - great customers and staff"
good,A typical work day consists of attempting to get business with your clients. You service them in the branch but the goal is to uncover more opportunities for financial business. My consultative selling skills have strengthened. The hardest part is winning business if a client is not looking for a particular product. The most enjoyable part is making a difference in someone's life with their finances.
good,"Great pay, solid hours and a very understanding work environment (in regards to your coworkers) all mixes together to create a wonderfully progressive and diverse work space."

good,This job gives you every opportunity to excel in your role. PNC's training programs are top notch. In my experience management wanted to help you grow in your role. Compensation could be higher.
good,"One of the best places to work for, great pay and workplace culture is very positive and relaxed. If you enjoy assisting customers then this job is for you."
good,"You have benefits almost immediately , the pay is awesome . The health insurance is the best I’ve had . Management genuinely cares about their employees."
good,I really like the people there. I worked in a call center where I met a lot of cool people. It was a very competitive environment because there was big bonuses given every month.
good,"great place to work, especially for college students. In the branch appointment setting department, we get to make our own schedule. They off a ""new mothers"" room for mothers to pump ."
good,I have been employed with PNC for over 12years.  I like working for PNC because they have great benefits.  I love the fact that they focus on diversity.  They also have good job security.
good,PNC pays well but closes a lot of branches so good people lose jobs. Overall I think this company was a great place to work. The advancements were available if you want to drive great distance.
good,"I've worked in both the retail and operations of PNC bank. They provide you the tools to meet your goals. Its your choice to participate in employee engagement opportunity which they do provide. I participated in several PNC outtings and enjoyed my time to meet people in different departments. Always great to put yourself out there and network. Overall, not a bad place to work."
good,I enjoy coaching sales employees to be the best they can be and provide our customers with financial success. I also enjoy coaching and leading the management teams to empower them to be great coaches.

good,"Answered calls for customers regarding their account as well as products and  services the PNC provided. I learned a lot about banking. The hardest part of the job was the volume of calls the call center took daily, The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers."
good,"My position, EASY. Coming from a background in industrial work, working for PNC is like home away from home. I love all of my coworkers, my superiors are always very respectful and responsible. The best thing about this job is the flexible schedule. I create my own schedule 2 weeks in advance! All-in-all, great place to be."
good,"you are always learning, meeting new customers and helping people achieve financial goals...co-workers are very helpful"
good,The position I'm in is pretty good. From the moment you start (training) you are fully covered by the benefits. Some days it could be crowded and hectic but some days it could be pretty slow and calm. The employees and management are fantastic.
good,It's a great bank to work for. Everyone is very helpful and nice. There isn't much upward or horizontal mobility within the business. Found it hard to move to different areas
good,"great company"
good,"Independent consultant"
good,"Productive fast growing company. They acknowledge your hard work, including employee appreciation week."

good,It was a new a fun experience that I enjoyed being apart of. Being given this opportunity allowed me to advance my customer service and banking experience while also creating new relationships with coworkers and customer. PNC is a huge banking company that also provide the services to help start my career in the financial industry.
good,"I love working at PNC, and the environment. I've been able to move to different areas and expanded my knowledge very quickly.I started it on credit cards then was soon able to go to sales and I am now a loan analyst."
good,I loved the work environment at PNC Bank. Very accommodating to college students. I would recommend when going to the interview to be yourself so they can see your uniqueness.
good,"Proactivly adjusting their training on feedback but with constant changes, part timers can see lack of information at times.  Training is full time hours but then after training its an immediate 20-30 hours a week with little option to get second PT job, best for college students and those needing another job but not for those who need full time quicker than 8 weeks."
good,"PNC has treated me well for 5 years! There are always opportunities to advance within the company. You do have to built for the job as you will deal with customers money. Some conversations will be difficult, some you have made a friend by the end of the call. PNC has paid well enough to take care of my bills even when I was part time, still in college. The customer care center is a great place to work!"
good,"A typical day at PNC would start off with a short meeting about goals and what the focus is for the day. You will get the opportunity to learn as much as you can. Management will hold you accountable for all goals no met and what ever areas you may be lacking. My suggestion for most would be to speak with your manager about your necessary improvements, draw up an action plan, and hold yourself to that plan. That's the best way to succeed. The workplace culture is very competitive because everyone has their own set of goals to meet. The hardest part of  the job is the stress that comes with the territory. The most enjoyable part of the job is having the fruits of your labor pay off and be recognized for it among your peers at an annual company wide recognition awards dinner. I LOVED working here. if you can manage stress well and are extremely competitive then this job is great for you."
good,Fast paced and a constantly changing environment.  Allows work from home opportunities.  The people are fantastic and they really do care about the happiness of their employees.
good,Must be able to endure stressful environments  as well as you must be able to take constant critisism but not in a bad way pnc is always about your growth and development as a person and employee
good,"PNC offered me to become one of the best employees I could be."
good,At this financial institute you will learn and grow.  This company is a well professional environment. Management is excellent. The coworkers there pleasant and nice. The hardest part of this job is closing a customer with loans or convincing them to invest for there future.I enjoy this company because its a caring and diverse company.
good,I started here when I was young and it was a great job that grew up with me. The customers are the best and it is great learning their stories and getting to know them. I have learned so much from this job a lot of young people my age probably know nothing about. Greatest opportunity I have had so far.
good,"Overall PNC is a good place to work.  The retail banking enviornment is stresful in general and PNC is no different, but PNC pays it managers well and the compensation plan was lucrative when I was there.  I have heard it has changed though"
good,"I support the Home Equity Partners Channel of the business: training, communications, marketing materials, promotions, and I am the systems administrator for their application entry system.

good,"Working at PNC was a very enjoyable job. In a typical day, I would get to meet a lot of customers and help them solve their financial problems. I have a very good experience with my manager. She was always there to let me try new things. The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers, but after awhile, they became something that was not so difficult to deal with."
good,Typical day at the job is dealing with customers and trying to get all of our referrals with the customers that come into the branch.  I learned a lot while at PNC.  I learned how to be a role model and a leader within the work place.  I also learned how to deal with customers on  daily basis and give them the five star treatment.  My Teller Supervisor is a great lady and anyone that has her as a manager would feel the same way.  She motivates us to be the best we can be at the work site.  The hardes part of this job is dealing with angry customers and trying to get all the information such as referrals done since this is a slow branch.  The most enjoyable part is dealing with appreciated customers and building new relationships.
good,"A typical work day consists of helping customers with their finances, extending great customer service to every customer and keeping up with current events and technology."
good,I loved my job here.  I learned a lot and never had 2 days the same. Constantly challenged to think outside the box.  Management team was fantastic! Co-workers were the BEST!

I have learned a lot about finances and banking. Co workers are great and very welcoming.

good,"I work as a banker at PNC, I do not have any complaints about the work itself, however I wish their pay was competitive with other banks. Beside that PNC offers really good benefits and paid time off."
good,"*Assisting customers to become more financially stable"
good,PNC is a great career starter. Although our branch is located in a small town its a good way to gain experience when it comes to skills and building relationships with our customers.
good,"There is no other place in the history of ALL my jobs that I enjoyed as much as PNC. I got along with everyone and was trained well. They wouldn't accept failure, and that's awesome! They also treated their customers well."
good,"I loved working at the bank, Because I was trusted to handle a large amount of cash. I learned so many new things from working at the bank. I learned how to count money a different way, and also how to handle customers that didnt speak English."
good,PNC is a wonderful company. They take care of their people in ways I wouldn't of imagined. I loved working with the people I've worked with. The most enjoyable part of the job was working in the drive up and getting to see the same customers just about every single day. I will miss them.The hardest part was how slow our branch was. It was hard staying busy everyday.
good,i enjoy doing what i do there. its great meeting new people as well as constantly creating conversations with existing customers
good,"Not every department has the same expectations and shifts and bonuses are different in each department. Some departments do not offer bonuses and won't allow you to request time off unless you use your vacation time and that has to be available that day that you need off. No one really cares what you have going on outside of pnc and you can trade shifts with co workers but if your department isn't 24 hours and you can only trade with people on your shift that males trading difficult because more than likely everyone just about works the same shift. Money is great for a full time employee every two weeks buy be prepared to eat, sleep, and breathe nothing but pnc!"
good,"I enjoyed my tenure at PNC. I never had a more wonderful management team coming from National City moving into PNC. They all believed in my when I did believe in myself. They nurtured me into the person I am. I worked with an unbelievable team in Michigan and wonderful people in Chicago.  I enjoyed my 16.5 years at the bank. "

good,"Compensation - fair"
good,"Great Company-  Great Benefits, great vision."
good,"Bonuses are paid off of sales for products, while one person may see a product does not fit the clients lifestyle, another will make the sale to profit themselves.  Not all management agrees with this, but when numbers are concerned, they will be passively aggressive to ensure that you get the sale."
good,"don't like the company, no family life working mid shift and working around a grocery store. not cool. This is not something that can be done daily, same customers everyday. Nothing really changes"
good,Great company to work for if your looking to get experience in banking and finance. PNC Bank offers room for advancement if you work hard enough and are willing to put in the work.
good,Since the new management went in to place we are extremely micromanaged. We see no longer a person but a number. They act as if we see robots. The moral of the team is at an all time low.
good,Its a good company to work for if you are in a right branch. Higher management is very professional and very supportive. They do provide good training when candidate starts as a teller.
good,"majority of my co-workers and customers were very nice which made all the difference. my take away from PNC is to be careful who you trust. no matter how nice you co-workers are, not everyone has your best interest"
good,"Pay is fantastic, ability to work from home, good work load."
good,"Ability to grow within the company was unlimitless.  In some instances management encouraged the growth of employees reporting to them."
good,"When I started there, I started in lock box as just data entry, but I found that I needed more stimulation and took it upon myself to learn the modules and running the TRP machines, until I finally made work lead in the area. There was no movement upwards, became stuck in the same spot until I moved to Collateral Clerk position."

good,The work culture is what you make of it. I love building client relationships and helping folks with their financial well being. The hardest park of the job is making sure that all procedures are followed to ensure the safety and well being of our clients and fellow employees.
good,Banking industry was fun to work for with incredible benefits and job opportunities.  Management was incredible and level of responsibilities was appropriate.
good,"I really enjoyed working at PNC and learning sales techniques for different customers. The knowledge I learned here is applicable in nearly every other job I have had, the competitiveness was not as fun."
good,I loved working in the environment. But it could sometimes be stressful. Management didn’t make things easy to work with them at times. Salary is great but not enough for cost of living

Many of the clients weren't sure as to what was in their best interest and that is where I was able to leverage my expertise to ensure they were taken care of.

When I first became a teller it was all new to me so some of the things were a little difficult but with repetition I learned how to use all the machines , I would say up selling was my hardest learned skill I did well with it but it was difficult,"

Once when you come in to work, and once mid day, and always once before you leave. Each teller is given their own drawers. Management was perfect, along with co workers. The hardrest part of the job is dealing with dificult customers and balancing your drawer. If you are more than ten dollars off, a manager must audit you before you leave work.

I reached out to insurance companies daily to receive updated documents which helped loans get to processing at a quick rate. My co-workers and I worked exceptionally hard and had fantastic results as the first group of Fast Path team members.  The hardest part of the position at times was just waiting for the insurance carriers to send over the updated documents.  Often many calls had to be placed to remind them to send the information over.  But overall the job was extremely enjoyable.  Especially on a day when you were able to tell the borrower everything was going smoothly.  Having a good relationship with the borrower really help make it apparent you were helping someone out and made the job very enjoyable.

The most challenging part of this position were the sales goals required of me."

good,"PNC has excellent benefit options, a lot of resources to learn from and to ask questions to. They have a pension plan and 401K (with a % match) and they had just bumped Minimum wage when I was leaving. "
good,"One of the best jobs I had ever had. This company gives you everything you could ask for. Benefits, Work/Life, Competitive compensation. The biggest issue they have is with MANAGEMENT. One bad manager can taint an entire experience, and that tends to happen quite often in PNC, as Managers are often quickly replaced and/or rotated. Consistent management is key to running a good business, and PNC fails to find good managers."
good,"I enjoy working I used to love my job until they turned to sales. and all what we do is pushing products to the clients"

good,Best company I have worked for that is dedicated to employee well being and customer service.  Tremendous benefits from Day 1.  Company is large opportunity for advancement.  Has very Strict Service Requirements for promotion is only downfall I see.
good,Working at busy location gave me an undestanding for fast paced situations. I was given a lot of responsibilites that helped me understand how to multi task. Having multiple situations being ran at the same time gave me the ability to priotize my duties. Also having the ability to help the hispanic community understand the benefits of the banking world that they didn't know about.
good,PNC is a great company to work for and provides a lot of opportunity for those who seek it. The compensation could've been better but overall I had a great experience working and growing with PNC.

good,Great place to work. Typical day at work start at 8am and work hard until 6pm. The only bad thing is they have yearly layoffs they call reduction of force. I wish they would consider the work one does before just laying off good people.

good,I enjoyed working at this bank and the management team was awesome.  It was a positive environment and there were opportunities to advance in your career.

good,"Working with customers was my favorite part of this job, not only did I start to know that regulars, but I started to have my own customers that only wanted to work with me. I love meeting new people and I enjoy this work environment. I've learned that sometimes you just need to be yourself. This was also a good place to work when you have children. They worked with me and understood family life. My co workers made it fun to come into work, we were not only coworkers but family."

good,I worked at PNC Wealth Management for 2 years.  I enjoyed my Trust Administrator function as well as my EA function.  The divsion that employed me was a small boutique with only 8 employees.  There was allot of uncertainty within the location.  In the years prior to my employment the divsion had cut almost all of its employees.  The uncertaity led me to seek outside opportunity.
good,"On a typical day I would process various types of customers' needs. Count currency, and balance my drawer."
good,"PNC is a great company that provides a nice stress free environment that promotes a wonderful work life balance.  I do worry that the sales expectations in order to compete with other financial institutions are balooning to a point where the current employees will no longer value their employment at PNC.  I would like a job where I can utilize my experience in an office setting and not be held accountable for ""selling"" products and services to clients who do not want or need those products and services."

good,I started with the company already with 14 years of lockbox experience. I learned quite a lot from all my management team.. i had several managers durint my years there and they all encouraged me to follow my dreams. The hardest part of my job was the shift changes. I started out on weekends and then went to day shift and finally ended on night shift.. The night shift was the hardest.. I enjoyed the fairness and recognition all employees are given and the rewards also. Overall PNC is a great company..
good,My coworkers are great. I really learned how to deliver great custonmer service!
good,Market banking products and services to small-medium size business. Managed and service existing clients but spend most of my day cold calling. New household and retention is key at this company. Senior Management has recently changed and the culture is changing at this company.
good,This was my first job out of college. Working with PNC Bank provided much of the support and guidance needed after completing your education. There are so many avenues across the business/financial services one can provide. Working here demands a lot of patiences to see your results grow.
good,"My only issue with PNC is the work load vs compensation. I understand a lot of employees claim this but the amount of certification I have and legal stress, threats of legal pursuit, actual subpoenas being served to employees for things out of our control, the amount of hostile customers dealt with- it is not worth the pay."
good,"I've learned so much. Enjoyed working from home and helping people so much it's unbelievable, it's been the best of my life. Bad management ended that"
good,"Very good place to work. Diverse staff and great work life balance. Secured parking lot, key card access, cafeteria, and snack room to keep you hydrated and ready to work."
good,The team I had the pleasure of working with were supportive of myself and my role.  Were always willing to develop my skillset to better enhance my performance and conversations with my client.  My bank family were always aware of others and made sure home life was balanced with work life.
good,PNC is an awesome bank to work for.  They truly car about their employees.  They take the time to understand their unique situation.  By allowing flexible working schedules and work from home options.
good,"Great training program, benefits, and management team. "
good,Enjoyed Working there. Learned some new skills. Great place to learn new technology especially for fresh graduates. Pretty relaxed and professional environment
good,Overall PNC is a good place to work. They provide a career path and incentives to continue on that path. The work environment has open workstation are to foster collaborative working environment however can be distracting to some.
good,"Worked at PNC on mainly IT security projects and learned a lot. Additionally, my team streamlined identity management processes in the whole organization."
good,"A great opportunity to take initiative and implement strategies to grow the business, improve client experience and reduce risk to the organization.. Its a growing division with excellent operating leverage,  There is strong leadership at all levels of the company and its created a great reputation in the industry."
good,"I can not review,  I still work here currently. I would not want this posted as many of my colleagues are on LinkedIn. I could loose my job due to our social media policy."
good,"PNC is a Great Workplace and I thought I would retire from this Company. In the last 7 years here in Florida I learned and had an awesome experience in Weston. I love my clients and my clients are very loyal to me. "
good,Consistent work structure with routines that allowed for expectations to be understood and met.  Branch work environment allowed for comfortable work atmosphere with associates.
good,"PNC takes great care of their employees, one of the few companies that still over pension plans. However, they are also the lowest paying financial institution on the market."
good,"PNC is a competitive yet fun place to work. Training is well conducted and the tools are always available. I believe that they should pay up to their standards, other then that PNC is a good place to work."
good,"Worked as a Private Client Group Relationship Manager. The position was FANTASTIC!! Great pay, great incentive opportunity, decent benefits, and excellent work/life balance. However, PNC has very poor managers. The managers are more concerned with sales production that they do about building relationships with the customers. And as a whole, they aren't very supportive of their employees. I'd recommend PNC to anyone as a place to work, but encourage caution with the management. Excessive office politics!!"
good,This job entails a lot of customer focus. Can be very demanding as far as working more than 40 hours. They offer a long of training materials. Good banking experience.
good,The work/life balance was an issue.  Work schedule and remote was not flexible. Co-Workers were great.  We had a collaborative and challenging work place.
good,"8 hours a day 8-5  Monday through Friday.  60 day training program with a mentor  that includes both online courses and classroom.  quiet, slow pace position."
good,PNC has rigorously taught me more about banking in all its meaning. I truly appreciate their training and dedication in teaching new individuals to succeed.
good,"great place to work not paid enough. I enjoyed working with the team, everyone was friendly. management was understanding when came down to my hard pregnancy."
good,"Productive worked a typical day will be making deposit, loan payment, withdraw money from checking or saving, issuing cashier check, cash advance taking phone call and reviewing customer account when they have a concern or an unauthorized transaction, solving customer account issues and referring other products."
good,Greatful for a company that invest so much time and energy into its staff. training is consistent. tools and recourses work magic. things within the branch need to change not the company.
good,"PNC is a great company to start a career at. The managers will work with you to make sure you are getting into the line of business that you want to work in. They have plenty of opportunities for advancement if you are willing to put in the effort. Your day varies based on the position you are in. We have branches, call centers, out of branch sales and multiple other lines of business. The culture is very friendly, I have always enjoyed the environment created by my coworkers. The most difficult part of the job is the amount of goals set for someone to accomplish, it can be overwhelming, at the same time extremely motivating. There is always something to work on. The most enjoyable part of the job is the relationships created within the workplace and with the customers."
good,"There is a reason why PNC is always on the top of 2017 NAFE Top Companies for Executive Women.  The work life balance is great.  The positions are generally very secure.  The salaries are lower than the industry average, healthcare isn't on par.  Raises are incredibly, shockingly, and insultingly low."
good,great place to work right after college. PNC will invest in your training and development unfortunately your pay will not reflect your training. Best advice learn all you can and find a job with a competitor.
good,"I loved my job at PNC, although management could get a little picky at times. Recognition was one of the best things that PNC had going for them."
good,I loved working In PNC. Its avery good place to work. Coworkers are awesome. Technical support center and resources are amazing. I have learned lots of awesome thing from the diverse work culture of PNC
good,"As a QA career i was involved in portal testing as well as database testing.As a QA Analyst i  attended walk through meetings with BA,Project Managers and QA Leads.I have attended Requirement review meetings and provided feedback to the BA."
good,This bank was great and had good customer service. A lot of focus was on selling the services providing by the bank. Customers were very pleased and didn't feel pressured.
good,"PNC Bank							October 2014 – Sept 2015"
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my co-workers. There was a lot of variety in what I did each day. The hardest part of the job was the extensive amount of changes everyday.  Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a large corporation."
good,It is a great company to work for!! There is a lot of opportunity to grow there if you want to. The management and my co-workers were very friendly
good,"A great diverse environment that values their employees job performances, driven focus on customers financial needs to companies standards. Team oriented, awesome experience."
good,"Great company to work for, but the pay is horrible for what all you need to do. There is not much room for advancement. People in upper positions stay forever."
good,Good place to work. My department very flexible with work/life balance. Room for advancement. Friendly co-worker. Great community programs.
good,Assist ONC BAnk customer with their Accounts . I learner the how the customers concern .  Co-worker were very helpful to each other . The enjoyable part of the job was being able learn Banking .
good,"A typical day would start out by everyone goofing around and laughing. The branch manager would begin with our morning meetings and sharing with everyone our CIQ's and how everyone is doing. My co-workers were great!! I made a family there for life, I expect where I work to gain a family. The hardest part of my job was not having enough time for my family, I was out of the house at 7am and home by 8pm. My most enjoyable part of my job was just simply being around the people I worked with, the group we have down there is by far the best group of individuals I had ever worked with."
good,"Good work enviroment to learn areas to sharpen, the leadership role is great!!!"
good,I have been with PNC for many years and have had great opportunities.
good,"PNC Lending Services care about their employees and are fair. They provide employees with continued updated information of new laws and regulations regarding the banking industry. Meetings, team building, one on ones, etc. Promote education, team building and assist in personal growth and development. Also participate in community support, volunteer work for the less fortunate. A fun place to work that offers job security within a corporate environment."
good,"Very pushy with sales, yet the coworkers are great.I learned how to solely manage a bank."
good,Process transactions for clients and learn about their financial situations as well as their personal life. My managers and peers coach each other throughout the day on ways to better the experience for our clients. My coworkers and I have good communication between us and we can go to each other for pretty much anything. I love the environment I'm in at PNC because I feel comfortable and clients really enjoy coming in and talking with us. The hardest part for me is getting referrals in for our products.
good,I like going to work each day always a new challenge and things where very pleasant there.
good,I really have enjoyed my time at PNC Investments and I think others will too.  Great place to call home!
good,A day at PNC Bank was always different never know who's going to call and what their going to say. It was always a challenge but a good one. They have a Daycare on site for emergencies (snow day etc.) Co workers and managers were great to work with. Some days we had fun time where we play bingo or bowling for small bank prizes.
good,"Good bank to work for, and good corporate culture.  The bank is very strong financially, and understands that clients are the most important thing"
good,"I love my job, enjoying helping others. I work with a great group of co-workers. My job can be challenging at times, but I can handle it. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers remain in their homes."
good,"As a customer banking teller and mentor, my primary goal is to create a welcoming environment in the branch, build rapport and provide outstanding service to the bank clients and new employees. I am responsible for performing accurate account transactions which mirror the sales process (Opportunity Management, Needs Assessment, Present/Pitch, Fulfillment, and Follow Up) in my daily work to create a positive client experience."
good,Come in at 4 assist the receiving department to prep the work for proof encoder. Correct and balance customer accounts to ensure they received the correct amount in their account. Encode when needed.
good,"Hired as a partner for PNC Bank Retail to service current mortgage customers, generate and acquire new mortgage customers, partner with realtors and title companies, and supply customers with new banking options to meet immediate and long term goals."
good,"I was able to interact face to face with customers experiencing hardships and assist them in anyway possible to remain in their home. This was also one of the hardest aspects of my work because you become involve with people going through one of the hardest phases of their lives. I worked remotely from home and traveled weekly in order to attend different events set up by government agencies and non-profits organizations as well. I attended both contested and non-contested trials as a witness in behalf of the bank in order to prove ultimate ownership of the note/property once in default. I had the pleasure of being part of an eight person team, while only three of us participated in the default work; we all got along and could count on each other as necessary. I learned to be a better listener and understand that a little compassion and empathy goes a long way."
good,Very good place to work and get your foot in the door for this career path
good,"Company was fantastic. They have excellent people throughout the organization that would like to help you succeed and advance. Typical day included customer service, looking to uncover needs, selling loans and investments and making phone calls. My co-workers were great and very easy to work with. Far and away the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to put customers in a better place financially."
good,A good company to work for. I would recommend this to a friend.
good,The call center - it honestly was a great place to work - lots of fun with co-workers and a lot of team work. I use the training about owning a problem all the time. I wish more companies cared about their employees half as much.
good,"Can be an easy place to get promoted in. You tend to learn alot on the job as opposed to web training or conventional training. Branch management is very good, but above that it gets iffy. Hardest part is the customers, and on top of that, customer service surveys that you have to deal with every week(and having it tied to your pay). Most enjoyable part of the job is the people(some customers but mostly co-workers)"
good,"answer customer calls, gather documents together for a loan closing, talk to the BDO to see if he has been in contact with other borrowers regarding other deals. Contact borrowers to requests documents, ask fellow co-workers a question possibly. Conference calls, clearing exceptions if needed. Updating pending report. The hardest part of the day could be trying to set a closing date. The most enjoyable part of the day is getting along with all of your co--workers makes the job a real pleasure."
good,This is a good company to work for I think management is overall pretty good A my experience has been nothing but positive since coming to work here I have met a good team members as well as management staff I enjoy working with my customers and the relationships I have built with the clientele is amazing
good,Great sense of team but highly competitive. Plenty of room for advancement. Management is very transparent. Incentives are easily achieved with a self starter attitude.
good,I love the the people I get to work with on a daily basis. We get along great and communicate well to get things done in the office. If I have any issues I know I can go to them
good,"I had an awesome experience at PNC. I learned a lot during my training and working with excellent co-workers. There is also a lot of opportunities to grow in the company, but without a degree, you cannot have a manager's position."
good,I enjoy my work from home position with PNC Mortgage. They have fair wages and paid time off as well as the typical bank holidays off which is always nice.
good,"Definition corporate banking job. Its great money for lower positions such as tellers (full benefits for full time and partial benefits for part time)."
good,"Handled many things with clients in regard to their money. Ran basic teller transactions, dealt with loans, mortgages, insurance, and wire transfers. Built a book of business and cold called clients"
good,excellent for those post high school thru BA degrees.  compensation for education above BA is unrecognized.  A day of employment consist of 2 breaks/ 1 lunch.  flexible scheduling based on department.  Lots of training in bank servicing.  Partially diverse.  pushing for more diversity however it starts from the top > down; with a widespread of backgrounds!
good,I enjoyed working for PNC bank. It was valuable learning about banking procedures. The work atmosphere was relaxed. I left to pursue other job fields.
good,"Great place to work, great benefits, current branch will be closing in April of this year.  I enjoy the work and the customers, on the job training could have been better.  Traveled to Columbus for training but was taught the very basics."
good,Their are so many different skills that one could obtain on both the teller side and the Sale and Service side of the banking world. Tellers learn the importance of cash management. Bankers learn the ins and out of products from DDA's to HELOC's.
good,Great place to work. But really banking is changing so much. The pressure is way more than what it use to be. Other than that. Great work life balance and great benefits.
good,I ended up in a different office where I didn't fit in as well. But pnc as a whole is a wonderful place to work. They offer lots of help and benefits.
good,"This position was a relaxed, entry-level title. Management was made up of a collection of managers that oversaw their own team. My manager and my team were all very nice people that cared about work-life balance. PNC offered up to 3 weeks paid vacation, in addition to 6 occasional absences and one personal day that you could take throughout the year. The pay started at 12 an hour when I first came in, but changed to 15 an hour as PNC upped their minimum wage. Overall, I saw that employees and managers were all very happy and content with what PNC had to offer. However, living in Pittsburgh is very stressful and expensive, so it's not for everyone. I would recommend PNC to anyone that likes a quiet, independent work environment. Don't expect to get out of your chair very much while working this position. The only big downside that I saw is that you have to really work hard in order to ever progress. Managers dont want you to move up. I am sad to leave, but only did so that I could go part-time somewhere else and resume my education."
good,Learn multiple roles and duties and job exposure. allow you to be places in leadership and recognition. Focus on customer experiences and traditional banking within the communities.
good,Overall PNC is an great place to work.  I think that as an existing manager there should be better pay when you move up with in the company.  The offer job advancement however you are paid way less then someone coming in new to the company
good,This is a good business with really good benefits and employee development. Really helped development me as an employee. I would recommend working here to a friend.
good,Everyone is willing to help out. Good environment where I feel welcome and accepted. Job is sometimes challenging but in a good way. Room for growth is good.
good,PNC is a company that believes in providing excellent service to the customer. I have learned different processes and procedures that have helped me to grow within the company. The management staff is very supportive in your growth and are very knowledgeable. At PNC they believe that the environment should be pleasant and professional. The hardest part of the job is understanding the needs of the customer and how your products relate to them. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a team that has great communication skills and the day to day interactions with the people we are helping.
good,I really liked working at PNC and worked there for 21 years.  I left for an increase in pay but the job did not work out.  I would go back to PNC if there is an opening for my qualifications.
good,"The company gives you tools to succeed. They promote from within. They offer great benefits, especially to new parents. Great training. A lot of opportunity for growth."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed the customers and coworkers while at PNC. I also highly respected the management and their practices. However, when it came down to compensation the amount of work required was not equivalent to the pay in my opinion."
good,"Working with PNC was great. I say with because they do whatever they can to include you as a part of the team rather than some they pay. PNC's training is the best I've had. The hardest part of my job was working from home and making that transition. That type of work is for some people and not for others. Unfortunately, it was not for me. PNC also does not let you transition back if you find it unfitting. Instead, you must wait 6 months to complete all training to move."
good,An average day at PNC Bank can be very stressful. Very high pace work load but over all the daily & at times hourly changes can be a bit much but it was nothing that I couldn't handle. I am a very happy and cheery person and some seem to be annoyed with that. What I enjoyed about the job was my customers and servicing them to the best of my ability
good,Great place to work especially when you have a family. Pay is low for price of living. they have advancement opportunities. Sales oriented culture. overall good
good,"I liked the fast pace work day because it made the day go fast.PNC had great customers, they would bring the teller line all kinds of cookies, candy for Christmas. Most all were patient and polite. This is where I learned the most of all of my banking experience. I had some great manager's. The hardest part was on the first and third of every month. The customer line would be out the door and around the corner. I enjoyed most of the employee's and customer's."
good,"Great company to work for amazing coworkers and management."
good,"Typical day at work : Send memos to customers , send checks , key rebates.  Run Exception reporting answer phone calls etc"
good,"If I lived in Pitt, Cleveland or Chicago, I'd work for them in a heartbeat.  I enjoyed the culture, management and the work.  They get that success grows from customers and employees."
good,Encode the checks and deposits and check for balancing if needed. Always willing to help others when needed. Offered to help in other areas when needed.
good,"I was only a part time teller, needed full time work. The atmosphere was great and I loved my co-workers. I would not have left if it was a full time position"
good,"Great place to work, the culture is very calm and professional. The management is great they work with the work/life balance concept well. Great benefits and the hours are great!"
good,"Working at PNC isn't so bad. Working a typical 8 hour day and 5 days a week is great. Also the benefits are amazing! The only thing is if you like tracking and getting micro managed by upper management then you should go for it. Other than that, helping out the customers can be very rewarding not only for yourself but also for your paycheck. Quite honestly, I don't have to  much to say that would be negative to work at the branch level."
good,There was always a great worklife balanace and the company was always sending out things to be involved in on a large scale for community involvement for the employees it was fantastic. You really felt like you had a family at work.
good,"I really enjoyed working here.  The corporate culture was much better than the average bank and the work environment was good.  It felt more fun than the average bank, and the customers recognized it.  However, pay wasn't good compared to other banks."
good,My main goal was customer service . Making sure customers were taking care of. Astreeful day at the bank was the annual bank audit making sure we pass at 100%
good,This place was a great start to learning the world of banking. It was great to learn the financial institution as well as working with the different clients
good,"Overall, PNC is a fantastic company to work for.  They are very development focused, have great benefits, and are more or less fair in decision making, though a little on the low side for incentives and salary.  My biggest issue with PNC is the job security and some of the management I have worked with being retained when they really shouldn't."
good,"PNC really is a great place to work. Though the compensation is not as high as other banks, there are many benefits and rewards that make up for it, including bonus money. It does seem hard to move into management positions from within the company, as I've seen less qualified individuals get jobs that I have applied for with little or no business or management experience."
good,I loved my job at PNC. They really invest in the growth and development of their managers. PNC offers quite a bit of continuous training at every level.
good,The company itself was great. The training was very well planned and thought out. The branch manager usually wanted us to skip lunch and stay late to help the customers. So it was very hard to balance hard.
good,I enjoy working at PNC Bank.  I have worked with a large variety of people at all levels and have gained a ton of knowledge.  PNC is big on community and that makes working there enjoyable.
good,"Merging with PNC Bank work load was heavy. taking on additional responsibilities with additional work and employees leaving due to the merge."
good,"Working at PNC does not have limits. You can work hard, network, and gain experience in whatever segment you like. It is your choice to be content or proactive."
good,PNC Bank is a wonderful employer with ample opportunities for growth.  The facilities are primarily modern and well kept.
good,"I learned the ins and out of refreshing and imagining , reimagining , software deployment and banking system setup for tellers/management."
good,Great place to work. I was able to advance fairly quickly but also had to work very hard. Knowing that work hard=play hard. I can consider being here for may years.
good,"Really pushes for success, Great company to work for job experience. If you have trouble there is a call center that helps you do your job. You take classes while at work to learn the company product and banking rules and regulations."
good,Great work place with lots of opportunities for advancement excellent training opportunities with good work and life balance.
good,"PNC offered  great Employee Benefits which included 401K ; incentives, insurance options.  It was a fast paced environment with high goal and  compliance expectations."
good,"	Book Keeper, duties included:  filing checks, running the encoding machine, prepared customer statements and answered customer inquiries."
good,Great company to work for. The work life balance is great. The pay could be higher though. There are a lot of opportunities to learn different skills.
good,I built my professional career at PNC. It was an opportunity that I will always be grateful for. I had the experience to manage multiple teams throughout PA and NJ and welcomed the challenges that provided me. I built my foundation of knowledge there and continue to build on everything taught to me.
good,"A typical work day would always be ""Hello Sunshine"" from our CTO.  He made everyone feel as though they were the only person around.  He was always kind, even during the coaching moments.  He is my mentor today, and has turned out to be an asset in my career path.   "
good,"Supervising many direct reports, relationship banking no force selling"
good,"8 hours a day"
good,"Informative, call center, 200 calls a day, sales calls, customer service calls"
good,I worked here for years and I loved it.  It was always a fun time and the staff was awesome.  Cool products in the store too.
good,This company was very good learning experience it gave me tools that needed to grow in not only as a person but as a co-worker. I enjoyed the people that I worked with and for.
good,"The day starts by opening up the branch and clearing the premises for other employees enter. After we set up for the day I conduct our morning huddle to discuss goals and commitments for the day. I plan the daily branch activities to attract new customers and to create awareness where our PNC Branch is located. Throughout the day I help train the many new hires we have to navigate through the genesis banking system and customer maintenance service browser while opening up new accounts or servicing existing ones. At the end of the day I arm the security system and close the branch."
good,"Thank you, I don't have anything else to say."
good,"processed transactions, money counting. opening closing procedures. Notary, and balancing"
good,"I love working for PNC, just wish the pay rate was better. Much lower when compared to other retail banks."
good,"PNC Cares about its customers, and it is a wonderful place to work."
good,"All of the best managers I have worked with were working for PNC. The fact that you have to take courses to become a manager at the Consumer Loan Center made it a very pleasant work environment. The Pace was VERY fast, there was a lot of work, and you were always busy ...however, all members of a team supported all other members."
good,I feel that no matter what the difficulty or issue is outside of work they make time for you to balance it. Co-workers will work with you and it makes the job a lot less stressful knowing what is expected of you coming in and that goals are set to obtain and thrive.
good,Processed checks worked in retail lock box department.  Very fast paced.
good,"Typical days are busy with clients issues.At times being a teacher of sort to some clients in educating them on diffident products according to their  individual needs. "
good,PNC is a growing organisation from I.T.prospective. The banking services of PNC is at par than any other organisation.
good,"I was a floater so I worked in many different branches, but every branch from Dover to Middletown management was great.  The customers had to warm up to me but after that I had no problems.  There really wasn't a hard part to this job.  The enjoyable part was counting money and the customers."
good,"Financial Sales Consultant"
good,"A typical day at PNC would be processing teller transactions, referring bank products by having conversations with clients, opening new accounts, CD's, processing small loans, settling teller cash draw. I learned that PNC cares about their clients and offers a grow up great program for children, to be fast and efficient, how to set a good example by my actions, to strive for achievement and to exceed all customer needs.  Management in most branches cared about their employees and recognized ones talents and ambition to succeed and helped in advancement.  Co-workers work together as a team in down time offer to help other team members so no one falls behind during busy branch hours. The hardest part of the job is when other team members call out.  the most enjoyable part of the job, looking forward to greeting bank clients, protecting and serving client needs, satisfying client concerns,"
good,"account opening and reviews"
good,"It is a good place to work, learned a lot about myself management is great"
good,"I took care of clients' banking needs and assisted them with any issues they had. I learned how to effectively multi task while still delivering a 5 star customer service experience. The hardest part of my job was to overcome obstacles such as referring clients to other products or having investment conversations. But, with the help of coaching, I faced my fears and now feel comfortable. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with and the different people I see to have a new conversation daily. "
good,"Worked from the comfort of my home, really what else can I say this job was wonderful.  How many people get to work in their PJ's with their feet up on their desk?  Not many,but I did.  PNC decided to close the main building that I worked form so my job was moved to Pittsburgh otherwise I had planned on retiring  from this position.  "
good,"As an employee at PNC Bank, several transactions were done through out the day. Great employees and work environments. the Team would constantly cooperate with each other to meet sales goals. The most enjoyable part would be seeing customers with a big smile on their face because the customer service you gave."
good,"My typical day at PNC was talking to and troubleshooting customer problems with using the internet to view their accounts online, paying bills, transferring funds, and other various banking needs."
good,"A typicall day at work is open the bank, make sure i prepare myself and my co wokers for th day. Before we open i always have a quick start which i talk about bank products and how we can make more sales. After we open i provide all the customers with professional and high energy service. I smile all day, I greet every customer that walks in the bank. I handle the vault and i deal wit customer complaints. I always make sure i provide the highest customer service skills that i possibly can and i make sure the customer leaves happy. I learned that providing good service is important. Staying focus and presenting yourself as a professional. I am an outgoing person i love talking to people and remembering faces. I am a team player. I believe that woring as a team makes the company stronger and a better enviornmnet to work in. Everyday i deal with things that i consider being hard. But i try my best to make it my best and make sure that i learn everyday from my mistakes. I enjoy working hard and i enjoy learning."
good,I loved working there just needed something that paid better.
good,"Always busy, training class was informative and learned a lot."
good,"I have worked for PNC Bank (formerly National City Bank) for the last 20 years primary in the Loss Prevention Operation areas. Recently our department got notice that are jobs will be relocated as result of PNC Bank recent restructuring and elimination of 23 positions, including mine, I am exploring new opportunities."
good,"Great company to work for, management and culture are excellent. Banking staff needs to be more involved in business and education."
good,PNC was a nice place to work but no room for growth in location I was working in.
good,"Sign on and process the requests in our queue (provisioning), check the ticket queue and resolve any outstanding situations all within the 72 hour service level agreement. You might get a few calls from the Help Desk for assistance and or users who need guidance and or knowledge on how to obtain a particular dataset, e-mail, VPN problem etc."
good,I've been promoted a few times and enjoy working there. It is a very good company for working mothers as far as childcare and flexibility.
good,I’ve had a wonderful experience with PNC. The work life balance is phenomenal. Being able to move up in time is also a great option. I love having options for career growth. No complaints.

good,PNC is a company that provides excellent benefits and work/life balance. The compensation is fair and management really cares about their employees. I came into the bank with absolutely no experience with banking and PNC gave me all of the tools I needed to learn and excel at my position.
good,Management is good. Bonuses are not as easy to obtain as explained but if in the right situation they are obtainable. I love being able to work from home and have the ability to start work at 9am. No overtime is a blessing and a curse.
good,"Excellent career training,coaching and overall culture. There is almost a zero error tolerance, so that would keep you on your toes(which to me was a positive). However, we were always short staffed partly because the low pay always led to a high level of turnover."

good,"Excellent place to work. I left for higher pay but have regretted it ever since.  I assumed all ""big banks"" were the same but they are not.  Good management, good work/life balance, and good benefits.  Pay below average and that is only negative."

good,I love my work place it's really nice good place to work. Management is good they give opportunity to people by looking your performance. Love my supervisor

good,You are always busy and never have a slow day. There are times that there is more work than people to do. Other areas in departments will help out if needed.
good,"PNC is a great place to work. They are flexible with your hours and you can also work from home. Their benefits package is top notch. What didn't work for me was that my entire team was located out of state, so I didn't have the daily face-to-face interaction with them that you would normally have with a location-centric team. They do have a company shuttle that goes to Pittsburgh. Even though it didn't work out for me, I would highly recommend them as an employer."
good,"This company is great to work for, but I am having trouble finding a way up the ladder.  The company does many things for its employees through out the year."
good,"Always a good day, unless there's a line waiting 30 minutes before you open. good thing the coffee is always stocked. Manager is great, co workers awesome."
good,Wonderful place to work people  are friendly. everyone is helping each other and there is plenty of room to advance for the correct person.  Always there to help
good,I have been employed for 15 years with PNC and have been around long enough to see the culture change for the better. They are more employee satisfaction driven and have worked harder to create a stable work/life balance
good,"Working with PNC bank was one of the best jobs I had so far. The pay was good even the schedule was perfect too. I always love to get in an out, I had 6a.m - 2p.m. schedule and that's what I loved. Management great! The whole facility was family!"

good,"I absolutely loved working for PNC. The company really values it's employment and the personal and professional growth of their employees. Due to the high value of the employees, it shows through to the customers so that the customers feel valued as well. I only left because they couldn't accommodate my school schedule at the time. I would love to go back to the company in a corporate perspective because I was just a teller."
good,PNC is a great company to work for and has lots of room for advancement. Days are always different but always busy. You deal with different types of people every day. I have learned a ton about finances and things I will need for my future in life.
good,Great environment and company has a focus on the customer.. great for starting out but advancement is not always coached to
good,PNC is willing to try the latest tech and will rethink the wheel - internal processes are always being improved and they listen to frontline employees who suggest solutions.
good,"Management and staff are dedicated to providing technology solutions to external customers, to our internal business teams, and to our operations team. All of these internal areas are also devoted to excellence for our customers.   We, in the systems development area,   have a very cooperative environment among other our partner teams in technology infrastructure, application development, product management and operations. This partnership  enables us to deliver  products and services with robust features and high availability  to millions of customers."
good,"Working at PNC was one of the best work experiences, as well as one of the best, if not the best work environment that I have ever been in. The incentives were excellent as well."
good,"Everyday is different. I go to work assist customers, talk to them as if they are my family. They ask about my family and I ask about theirs. Every week I am in charge of balancing the ATM, as well as every month I order the branch supplies. I love my co-workers, they are my other family. There really is not a hard part about my job. The most enjoyable part about my job is seeing my customers and getting to know them on a personal level. My job is located in a small town so everyone sticks together."
good,I only worked for a year and half at the company and I worked part time. My co-workers were friendly and easy to work with. I did not receive many benefits working part time.
good,"The typical day for a financial consultant, at Pnc Bank, starts at 8:30am. We all arrive and enter the building following safety procedures. A meeting is held to determine daily goals and special projects. Continued maintenance from the day before is completed. The doors and phone lines open at 9am. Throughout the day you juggle phone calls and clients in your office. The interactions may be as simple as changing a pin number on a debit card to helping a client recover from being a victim of fraud. Each integration is unique and the work to conclude it can take from 2 minutes to many days. During each interaction my goal is to gain a full financial picture for the client. I want to make sure they understand their banking, have proper protection on their finances, have a true financial goal and plans to achieve it as well as to make sure that they are receiving all the benefits that their bank has to offer. The best part of my job is being able to help a client achieve their goals. I have many success stories and love them all."

good,"Good Environment."
good,They were very flexible with my school hours. Everyone was nice and easy to get along with. I learned more into the banking system. The hardest part about the job was counting at the end of shifts and the best part was the interactions with customers and employees.
good,"Process customer transactions related to deposits, loan payments, withdrawals, and account transfers."
good,"My job was a customer service based position . I was conducting my business on phone. In mortgage business is a life long learning job , because with each client you learn something different . I was always very lucky to work with the best management , who had a open door policy if i needed some help management was their to help me. I always learn something new from my previous managers."

good,Typical day in management deals with customer service and team development. The most enjoyable part of the job was developing future leaders.
good,Many years as  Teller. Enjoyed most of the time. Meeting sales quota the hardest part of job
good,The first 7 years of employment gave me everything that I needed in an employer. With the reconstruction the heart has been taken out of PNC.  This has taken away my excitement and interest in my job.
good,PNC is a wonderful place to work. My typical day consisted of traveling to branches throughout the West Essex Region.
good,"Great company, it offers extensive mortgage opportunities"
good,"An equal opportunity employer. Great place to work, good opportunities to grow. "
good,I feel that I had a very supportive manager who was concerned with my success. She was also very understanding and offered a lot of her assistance.
good,"An 8hours typical day at work. I've learned to processed, received, various checks using a database entry level, Good Management overall and my co-workers are pleasant as well. The hardest part of the job was on the editing side and the most enjoyable part of the job was the hourly rate was good, sufficient enough to get an excellent group insurance."
good,"I was responsible for creating spreadsheets containing different types of data as well as helping to organize networking events for a training program. I worked with one other intern on some projects and we worked well together. I had a decent manager who for the most part always had a set schedule for me to follow. At this internship I learned how to work in an office setting, mostly dealing with learning to work under a manager, meeting deadlines for projects, etc."
good,Banking in wealth management department. Enjoyed the diversity of job task/multi task. Kept me busy
good,"Advise current book clients regularly on important financial decisions that affect the overall success of there business. Manage overall risk for the bank when providing solutions to clients. Provide lending, deposit, and treasury management solutions. Experience developer and leader of people."
good,"I loved going to work, I would start my day by checking on my 8 employees and making sure they have everything they need to start their day. If not, i reconciled these issues. I would start my own responsibilities, and do my individual tasks, but was routinely helping out my team with issues, and even my management when they were overwhelmed! The most enjoyable part of my job, was I was BUSY!!! I love to be busy and I love that I was able to do many jobs, so when someone was out, I could fill in, and my department did not fall behind, The worst part of my job, was when we closed the doors and saying goodbye to people who I became friends with and many whom I respected!"
good,"This company is one of the top companies to work for in my opinion. They offer a good benefit package even if you are part time. I loved working for the company, I just didn't like the position I was doing."
good,The day starts with me signing on to outlook to respond to all outstanding e-mails. The phones immediately start ringing with request for information or scheduling appointments for my boss. I may have to reconcile her expense report. Make travel arrangements for outside meeting. This would include making overnight hotel acccomdations. I usually have certain projects that are ongoing such as setting co-workers up to have access to research tools that would help them with projects that they may be working on. Update a master calendar of events. The hardest part of my job sometimes is trying to get information from some people inorder to complete a job assignment. The most enjoyable part of my job is completing a huge project sucessfully.
good,"The most important thing is customer relationship. The goals are good and not impossible to achieve. Schedule is kind of hard, especially not being home all day long, however the team is great in working around days off."

good,"PNC is inclusive and diverse. The pay is fair and they offer great opportunity for advancement. If this is a field you are interested in, it is a great company to work for"
good,"Great company to work for. I worked for an agency on a contract but still treated fairly. Worked for several Banks, PNC is definitely the leader as far as how they treat employees"
good,"They pay really well. But you have to be sure to tell them the hours that you want and if need be, wait until that option becomes available or you may be stuck."
good,Better than most competitors. The goals are lofty but attainable. The customer service focus and putting them at the center of all the bank does. The internal tech is lacking.
good,"Very pleasant colleagues to work with.  Management at my branch in Madison Heights is very caring and supportive.  It can be very fast paced, but that is was makes the job challenging and builds on customer service and attention to detail.  They offer full benefits including 401K to full time employees."
good,By developing great skill sets to leverages products and services to increase the financial well being of clients and build long lasting relationships.

good,"The Call Center is a very competitive and sales oriented environment. It is very structured and they have high expectations of their employees, If you are interested in that kind of environment you will thrive there,"
good,"Although I was in a contractor role, PNC was an excellent company to work for. Friendly atmosphere and the company has many core values that are employee focused, including work and life balance. I would highly recommend!"
good,"Great to"

good,"I loved this company. I was looking forward to relocating and retiring with this organization. Although they claim not to hard sell to customers like Wells Fargo, that was not the case. When you achieved your goals, you were rewarded. "
good,"I’ve been at PNC for 2 years, and I’ve been full time for 1 year. My branch is great, everyone is super friendly and helpful. However, my BM isn’t the best... Yes there are goals you have to meet but they aren’t breathing down my neck to meet them. I mostly know all my clients that come in so once you get the hang of it and get familiar, selling products will come naturally. This was my first bank job."
good,"PNC is a great corporation to work for. Management is great, but the area for advancement is at a minimum. You never know what type of day you will have at PNC. It changes from day to day."
good,This is a great place to work. Really try to make sure every employee has work life balance. They offer great benefits as well. Pay is competitive to others in market.

good,PNC is a company that truly cares about its employees and customers. The pay is competitive and that is always room to advance in whatever area of the bank that you choose.
good,"The people you work with are great and the day to day activities keep you busy, but because it is so close with government work you have to make sure you are following all policies to the letter. You can be let go on a moments notice because of this regardless of how good a worker you are."
good,Great place to work fast pace customer focused. Managers work with you if need assistance or have a emergency. Overtime is great and you get time and a half.
good,PNC is a great Bank to work for and they are much more people centric than other commercial banks.  Management takes a keen interest in your development and advancement.
good,"Being apart of Legends at PNC bank arts center was really fun. "
good,"I loved this position,  I was only part time so I didn't receive benefits or paid time off.  The company was very good to their employees.  All my supervisors were great.  "

good,"Well organized  , enjoyed my time here, fixed schedule, incentives, good management, good culture, self developed , organized company overall, good benefits 3 vacation weeks"
good,PNC is a fine company to work for. The work atmosphere is quiet  the office is a “green” building so it’s hard to hear. Management is awesome.  The hardest part of the job is it’s always changing.
good,"I loved working at PNC, the managers were great at teaching you to be a better employee, co-workers shared best practices that would help everyone out, some managers would create a fun and competitive atmosphere, be prepared though to deal with aggressive and unfriendly customers every now and then, they would say terrible things over the phone"
good,"I would recommend PNC Bank to any and everyone.  A great environment to work in. Great benefits- 401K, pension, healthcare ect.  Management guides you without micro managing."
good,"Banking gave me the experience to enter the work force. Training was quick with precision. Overall, progress and advancement was very very slow. There were challenges and skills acquired in cash and fraud management where I performed very well and even above the call of duty."
good,A typical day was fun but challenging. I was able to do multiple projects while relying on my team to help us move forward as a branch and company. The sales aspect of the job pushed me to work harder to receive bigger bonuses at the end of the quarter. My manager was invested in my growth with the company along with making sure we left work at the office and not at home.
good,"The team I worked with felt like family. Management was understanding and worked with people for scheduling. Over time was always available. "
good,"Started with this company after college. Like almost everything about it. I work with a great team and have a great manager. Each day is something new, always learning. Lots of opportunity here. See lots of familiar faces each day."
good,This was the best place I was ever employed! The company in general is great but of course as with any job you will have your certain people in management that aren't good at and that would be the only real downfall to this place.
good,Loved working there left only to pursue a higher education degree. My mentor and senior financial advisor was wonderful and helpful and took time to teach me.
good,I enjoyed working here with my customers and employees. My manager was helpful and there for support as well. I was recognized often for my work and given the opportunity to move up in the company. I learned allot from my manager and co managers as well. I would like to go back if the opportunity arose again for me.
good,"I loved my job at PNC. The employees I worked with were superior to any other place I had been, and the manager for the branch was truly amazing. There was always a push for sales, but it was always a need based sale. The incentive system was pretty good, but could definitely be improved, as your largest bonus was at the mercy of every client, which could or could not hurt you. Often, any poor reviews were due to circumstance out of your control. However, though there were bad interactions, all of the positive interactions made your day great. Overall, an enjoyable work atmosphere and a strong company to be with."
good,"Great management and co workers motivated to deliver excellent customer experience.  Strong focus on doing what is right for the customer.  "
good,"I am very pleased and honored to be working here at PNC Bank!. I plan to retire here. I have been employed in the Customer Service field for more than 30 years. I enjoy assisting my customers on a daily basis. My position here allows me to meet people from all walks of life. I enjoy my customer interactions every day. "
good,I have enjoyed working there and the place that I worked that I learned a lot about this and their management was good.  Sometimes I get under pressure and I managed to get by the deadlines.

good,"This was the best job I ever had, the only problem I had was that our compensation was extremely low for what we were doing. Their safety procedures were great"
good,"Good company that promotes diversity on all levels, strong foundation of customer service and client interaction.  Large institution with a small town feel."
good,PNC is a fantastic place to work. The culture is becoming more and more progressive. Work life balance is a top priority as is Talent Development. PNC continues to be competitive and I only see the Bank growing in the coming years.
good,friendly people good management nice workplace culture and good system to learn how can you developing your skills fast working and successfully achieving the company goal with time to enjoyable in your department operations .
good,"Company is employee friendly and believes in quality of life and a true work life balance,  Employee development is encouraged and supported at all levels.  Each employee is provided the opportunity to do their best each day"
good,"I was employed with National City Bank when it was acquired by PNC Bank. I have a long history of bank take-overs and I must say that PNC was outstanding in the way all of the employees and customers were treated. Optimum training was offered and time was properly given for each employee to know how to make the transition very smooth for the retention of our customers."
good,"Working at PNC has been great I've learn a lot of things about myself and also about the job itself ."
good,"Receiving and assisting customers with the inquiries"
good,Besides dealing with the customer's calling frantically about their money I enjoy PNC. The team leads value your opinion.
good,"I learned a great deal at PNC.  My immediate Supervisors were dedicated to our success,  I was looking forward to going full time when the decision was made to move West.  I was a Teller.  Not a Branch Manager"
good,"I greatly enjoyed working at PNC Bank for all of these years. I would still be there if it was not that I had to move back to Alabama. While there I was able to gain many relevant skills that afforded me to be very successful as a Branch Manager, Team Leader, Partner, Trainer and most importantly a Positive, Supportive, Encouraging TEAM MEMBER!"
good,Great company to work. True genuine people you'll meet. Opportunity for advancement. Great work-life balance. Couldn't work for a better company. Only downside is the pay isn't competitive
good,A typical day was i would come in and try to clock in if a computer was open then the manager would have me stand in the lobby for my whole shift unless someone in the branch wasn't their then i would cover for them.
good,PNC was very key in my leadership development. I was given many great opportunities for growth. They were great in leading the way in communicating the direction & atmosphere they desired for the branches.
good,"I found PNC, a very professional and well managed place to work. customer service is 5 star and I increased my skills in it while working at PNC."
good,"A typical day for me was driving 90% of the time, visiting a select group of retail bank branches to educate branch employees on the features and benefits of PNC Wealth Management.  During these conversations, I helped to identify the right customers who could benefit, and provided conversational techniques that could be used to refer branch customers to Wealth Management.  Often I made outbound calls directly and met with customers.  Throughout my career I created sales training materials that were effective in these activities.  In addition, I created reports to measure progress toward sales goals, and analyze bottlenecks in the sales process. These reports tracked the value of the pipeline, number of referrals, and tracked closed sales.  My role was to act as a liaison between Wealth Management and the Retail Bank, to resolve issues regarding awarded incentives for closed sales, recognize successes and support the Wealth Management sales team.  As the most tenured in my role, I was often called upon to create new processes and train other employees in my similar role.  I helped to set sales goals each year. I partnered with Marketing to create and implement sales educational materials that were used companywide, and recommended sales processes and strategies to senior management.  This is a fast-paced organization with very aggressive sales goals.  High energy, flexible individuals would be the most suitable candidates for employees at PNC."
good,Everyone was very positive when they were in the building. The teamwork there was as strong as any team I had ever been a part of. I really enjoyed being there every day and was pushed to be the best I could be at my job by my manager.
good,Top Management and work culture. Easy to find mentors and amazing employee benefits and retirement plans. The opportunities to grow internally may come with challenge. The technology and training programs available are the best and you can tell JPM made a strong commitment and investment to their training and recruiting.
good,"Worked as a travelling teller in the North Region.  I got the opportunity to see many different branches and develop an understanding of how retail banking works and how each branch finds a way to adapt to their surrounding community.  "
good,"Really fantastic work life balance, management is typically very down to earth and helpful. People genuinely care about your success in your role, ranging from upper management to peers. The only suggestion I would make would be to avoid this role if you are used to a traditional banking background. The new universal banker role is very much sales driven, and those uncomfortable with warm calling and sales quotas will not enjoy working here."
good,"Excellent company, Great Staff, but your just a number in the large banking world.   A lot of travel. Excellent ability to learn."
good,"I regret it did not work out, but I moved into a wrong position and could not return to what I was best suited for.  I wanted to return to Branch Management and did apply, but for not the right areas."
good,Coming in and doing all the safety procediures before opening the bank. Making sure I have enough money to start my day. Greeting customers as they enter and making sure their needs are met.

good,"Constantly on the go enjoyable work environment"
good,"In a typical working day i had a great team of workers,good supervision by managers.Obviously the hardest part is the end of the day where you balance your cash drawer to prove you had no shortages or overages.The fun aspect is convincing customers to subscribe to a particular product"
good,I love helping people - This was a perfect job for my skill set.
good,"As a Business Banking RM role required that you attract, retain and grow new and existing business."
good,My overall experience with the company was the best. Everyday was a joy working there. Always learning something new everyday. Being able to work along side of several coworkers who all depended on one another and believed in one another.
good,Co-workers were very helpful with all the program documentation required
good,"A nice branch with older customers..Co-workers very helpful..great training program. nice management, I learned alot about loans"
good,productive fun place to work where we form relationships with customers. We do not just process a transaction we speak to the customers help them feel comfortable and let them know that anything that occurs in there financial life we are here to help and show them everything they need and want to know
good,"PNC is a great company to work for. Their commitment to coaching and training is truly outstanding! I loved working in different areas of the branch and being utilized anywhere I was needed. You truly have to have a passion for customer service when working there, and of course like any other banking position, thick skin because you are working with our customers money. You need to be able to say NO or tell them why their account is over drawn, or say why their loan was not approved. PNC is known for being the most conservative banks around, but I was a very proud member of PNC and will always be thankful for my time there! I learned a great deal, and had an awesome experience. Banking is fun, and it's all about the kinds of conversations you have with the customers to uncover their needs."
good,"PNC to me is the best bank to work for in the banking industry.  Over the course of the past decade, sales has becoming more and more aggressive to interest and convince clients that their bank is the best.  At PNC, you are the best because we tailor a conversation specific to get information form the client and have them talk about themselves.  As a Relationship Manager, we use what they told us and fit them into the correct products and solutions.  PNC is aggressive but in a different way as they show they care for the relationship over just the sale.  The sale means that person will get their Credit Card, Home Equity, Mortgage, Car loans from a different bank rather from the person from PNC who is already discussing this with the clients.  A highly recommended company to work and gain experience in the industry."
good,"This past summer I learned a great deal about PNC as an intern in the HR Metrics & Analytics Department.  While there, I had the opportunity to work on implementing the PeopleSoft 9.1 project, a Human Resource Management System allowing for Enterprise Resource Planning to consolidate all business operations into a uniform system environment and deliver value to its stakeholders.  Another project I worked on was an analysis of turnover rates, shifting salary quartiles, and costs to move salary bands among several large markets.  In addition, I completed was a Financial Overview of PNC Compensation & Benefits compared with several other major banks in order to assess PNC’s rank and performance among its rivals in that area.  Finally, I assisted in creating dashboards in OBIE 11G, a program which allows for easier access to corporate data and provides common infrastructure for reports and analysis.  Aside from these projects, I gained experience in creating professional relationships among employees that assisted me with my work."
good,PNC has a great work/life balance and team environment. I feel that everyone cares about educating one another and growing within the company.
good,i love my job... its the best company ever.. just keeping my options open to better opportunities

good,A typical day at work would be what you would expect from a bank. we processed customer transactions while providing them with great customer service. I have a great relationship with both my branch manager as well as my teller supervisor. they really were hands-on and always willing to help. the most enjoyable part of my job was hearing customers say that I made their day.
good,PNC was a nice employer to work for.  When the opportunity came up for a work from home team I was selected for it. It was a great opportunity.  I would still be working for them if they had not closed the call center I was working in.
good,"A typical day at work is to come in continue working on files, gathering documents and closing loans."
good,A company with great values.  Emphasis on work/life balance.

Openning checking,savings and Indiviual Retirement accounts."
good,"When I first started in the banking industry it was more of a town home bank. We were bought out by PNC and joined the corporate world, naturally there were alot of changes and I adapted very quickly. I had a very good customer following. I worked well with my co-workers. One thing in particular that my customers and co-workers would always comment on is the fact I always remembered names."
good,I have worked at PNC for going on 8 years. I have grown as a person and manager in this period of time. They worked well with my school schedule during college and provided me with a great work/life flexibility. I even met my fiance while working for PNC. 
good,My day at work is at most times easy going. I talk to customers all day long on the phone and handle their problems.  I work in a team but as well have my own file that I am responsible for each month.
good,"I cant say enough good about this company! Great place to work, with wonderful employees!"
good,Helping people with their banking needs and to see if there is anything else or products that they would be interested in.

good,"Great place to work. I was hired in as a supervisor, received a signing bonus and didn't have the experience but they took a chance. Great place all around. Nothing bad to say about PNC."
good,Salary to low for tellers as we are the face of the company. We are the first people customers see and many times offend. We do alot of work and maybe have one of the highest pressure/stressful related job.
good,"A typical day at work would start by updating the team lead on the progress of the task assigned to each team member,this was always conducted in a meeting of testers for example if you are writting test cases and you realize a requirement is not clear,it was a platform to present any obstacle with regards to your work assignment,i also had an opportunity to act as a Team Lead and this was another exciting challenge at work interms of mangement from implementation of Agile methodies as a scrum master,reporting,assigning duties and setting timeframe for the assigned work..Team work was ineviteable culture nobody wanted to ignore,a failure for a single person would cost the whole team so we encouraged the spirit of consultation whenever you needed any help.The hardest part of the job is while reporting the deffects there would always a tag of war between testers and developers.and the most enjoyable part is when you identify major deffects in an application."
good,PNC has shown me support and that I'm valued. This company definitely cares about your personal and professional interests and development.  I plan to be with this establishment long term.
good,I enjoyed the continued compulsory trainings we had to complete. They kept us up-to-date. I also loved being in an environment that challenges you to push past comfort zones and continually learn new skills.
good,"Great place to work. Every day is different. Fast pace and could be stressful but not unbearable. As an employee you must own your career,  managment is there to help and coach through out the way."

good,I loved pnc they made you feel like family such a fun work environment they help you when they see you are trying and want to do better they are very reasonable
good,I had 3 managers while working at PNC all were very sweet and understanding in any circumstance I faced. Team meetings and one on ones with managers are done often and motivated me to do better. Managers are there to help you succeed and moving up is very easy if you put in the work
good,PNC is a great place to work at because they care. If you have a family to raise financially it may not be the best move to make due to the salary of a teller. PNC has a great 401k and great benefits.
good,Wonderful Job all around. Management kept things running smoothly while making it feel fun. They just need to pay more and provide better benefits and no one would ever leave.
good,"Pay is not up to par Chase pays 18.00 an hour for call center work, but Management is good, monthly insensitive is great I think its up to 850 extra a month super easy to meet goal, customers are pretty easy did not have a lot of angry calls, If you honest with your manager about what is going on personal they will work with you on personal issues going on. Manager will push you in the right direction just let them know your goals. I worked from home they supplied equipment I did have to pay or my own internet which I was given mixed messages on from the start. depending on shift hours can very."
good,Want to work for longer time in TCS but sometimes we need to grow and need to take further actions for personal development. Want to work again with PNC in future as full time employee.
good,"Great program and benefits to employees, however pay isn't competitive to other financial institutions.Management is great in helping their employees get better acquainted with their duties."
good,Great Company. Large focus on employee growth and development. Competitive Salary and work life balance. Customer service focus is also a great value that PNC stresses.
good,"PNC has been a great place to work. They offer education reimbursement, pensions, even paternity leave outside of the normal benefits most places offer. They are willing to work with you to get you into better positions, and you can always try and advance your knowledge of the company. There are remote positions, and partially remote positions. I myself work from home 2 days a week, and I have 4 weeks of vacation time, swing holidays, and sick time.  The only problems I have ever had with the company is the pay is generally on the low end of the scale compared to some competitors, but I have found the pension and other benefits make up for this. The organization is constantly changing as they expand into the West, so some positions change, butnif you are a hard worker, they will be sure you are moved to where you need to be in the company during these changes."
good,PNC is by far a wonderful work environment. Hours are normally 9 to 6 and their company values are wonderful. I love the fast pace and customer interactions that happen on a daily basis. Truly a wonderful environment.

good,Great experience and culture. Provided strong training experience and provide the why behind everything. Was equipped within months. Customer experience being top priority.
good,PNC was a great company. They care about their employees and provide a lot of awesome benefits. The only reason I left was because I needed a full time position and there were no openings at the time of my employment.
good,Pnc was a great place to work and the employees were wonderful i learned alot from working there and would recommend it. The pay was great and the care about your wellbeing. You get paid time off if you had to go on leave for any medical reasons and the send you cards for your birthday. This was a great place ti work only reason i left was medical reasons.
good,"PNC is a great work environment, I enjoy going to work every day my manager makes it easy to excel at what I am doing and What to continue to grow and learn more only down side is that compensation could be better"
good,"I loved my time at PNC. I made a lot of great friends there that I am still in contact with even though I am four states away. "
good,Lots of exposure to different roles. I have learned how to do more out of branch work and sales. The workplace culture is good they do care about your opinion however management tends to micromanage. Hardest part of job is hitting incentive with lower salary. Most enjoyable part of job is knowing that you could eventually transition into another role.
good,"A typical day at work is supporting neighborhood businesses, helping people improve their financial wealth and volunteering our time and expertise. I ensure other team members achieve their goals as we grow the business and leading by example. To be well-organized with the ability to multi-task and prioritize. The enjoyable part is when as a team we help customers reach their goals. There are also many activities our team is involved in our neighborhood to make our jobs more fun and relaxing."
good,This job has been great for me because it has allowed me to experience working full time with a company that values their workers. I feel there is little advancement opportunity in the location that I reside in. I also will be getting my bachelors degree in May of 2019 so I definitely looking for a pay increase.
good,I love working for PNC its a great company to work for its sales oriented but is not hard to do. The management team i had was great and the training is all paid for. The benefits are great the hours are set i cant say anything bad. The only thing i will recommend is if you work in banking you have to move to other branches or other banks if you want to move up advancement within the company is difficult.
good,In my top two favorite companies to work for.  This company had great benefits and was very reasonable with the amount of work.  I felt very fulfilled.
good,Working here has allowed me to grow within my skill set and experience that I’ve gained within my career. Taking the leap to come back to retail banking and excel has been amazing.
good,The work environment at PNC is exceptional. The manner in which the management team treats the employees is great and there is always someone willing to help.
good,"A day in the life of PNC consisted of taking approximately 50-75 calls a day, also having a meeting once a day with your manager. fasted paced work environment. The hardest part of the job was servicing escalated calls. There were times when contests got you different incentives and also received bonuses for work well done, which was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"a typical work day, you get here open the branch everyone gets settled, we have a daily morning meeting, ive learned a lot that benefits you not only at PNC but else where"
good,The colleagues that I was surrounded by helped me achieve success. I was excited to come in to work everyday and work with my colleagues as well as with my clients that I built long lasting relationships with.
good,I loved working for PNC the staff and management we all great people and fun to work with.  Great benefits and very family oriented.I have nothing bad to say.  Great atmosphere.  Overall best place I've ever worked at.
good,"I moved up to supervisor after working in mail services as a clerk. I was mentored, supported and trained by many people in my group and grew my confidence in my learning on the job. I supported 7 to 2 people on my team in 5 years. After many process changes I managed and supported my team during challenging times without missing a beat or missing any SLA’s. I coached and supported my team during time off and was always a working manager. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I problem solved for internal and external customers to came to a happy resolution. The hard part was coaching team members to give more than their job requires to help them see how important they were to our team and how much a difference they made in the company. I enjoyed working for a company who supported diversity and inclusion and everyone’s opinions mattered."
good,"Good training. Unlike some other laid back banks, management here expect a whole lot from you, so it keeps you on your toes. They are very big on sales and have a very low error tolerance policy. This could be a negative/ positive depending on how you look at it, I saw it as an opportunity to learn and go above and beyond the status quo."
good,Very busy day to day operations. The management was great in my dept. I worked with a great team of people. Very great experience in learning banking.
good,"Great bank. Good sales process, good middle management. Benefits are standard for the industry. PNC is a middle of the road bank in terms of base salary but decent quarterly bonuses."
good,"PNC allowed me to transition into banking comfortably.  My manager was a wonderful leader, mentor and coach.  My assistant manager who I worked closely with was patient and always available.  PNC will allow you to grow within the company as long as you have the desire to succeed.  The downside with PNC was the requirement to send referrals to bankers from the teller side.  Other than the need to refer products and services, PNC Bank was a great company to work for. It was a pleasure to work under great leadership"
good,"Morning meeting , goals and expectations of the day."
good,I absolutely loved working for PNC. The only reason I left is that I was presented with an opportunity making substantially more money without the hour long commute. Have every intention of re-applying there during my job search.
good,PNC at that time was merging with a few banks. I worked through two acquisitions. Work environment was great a real family oriented place to work.  My managers were involved with the community and we were kept abreast of services we could implement.  The transition became turbulent which lead to a lack in oversight of sustainability in some branches.
good,"Collaborative, respectful, supportive working environment. Company really values employees and customers.  They are trying very hard to modernize their technology & business processes in a heavily regulated environment - not easy but they are making progress.  Because it is such a great company to work for, employees start with and stay with the company.  This has + / - issues. One negative is that they have become a bit ""in-bred"" and lack knowledge of new tech and ideas.  Even that is changing - slowly."
good,"Company had grown fast in small amount of time.  Excellent management, great place to work.  Company was in process of being bought out by Washington Mutual Financial"
good,there very friendly and really interested in you career goals. Since the first day I started I made my goals known to my manager and she did her utmost to make sure I reached them.
good,Overall a pretty great company to work for! At least my position and the hard worker that I am. Their maternity and parental leave is also 100% great!
good,"Provided routine service support to customers who initiated contact with the Customer Care Center. This involved questions regarding products, online directions, and their accounts.Communicated directly with customers, as an internal service partner, to effectively resolve issues, questions, and service requests. I learned a lot about working with irate customers. I did well with deescalation of irate customers. The hardest part of my job was not being able to assist my customer on occasion. I enjoyed working with my customers. I loved when I could calm them down when they were upset."
good,"love the work life balance, collaboration,the talent development and the growth opportunity PNC has to offer, location is very close to home couldn't ask for a better place to work"
good,PNC has a culture of community and development. They treat every employee fairly and provide care for growth. In my experience I have the pleasure of being trained and promoted numerous times within PNC.
good,Great company to work for just not enough room for advancement due to more jobs out of North Carolina! Some management understanding & great to work with!
good,Really good benefits and competitive pay as well as many opportunities in and out of branch to advance. Healthcare is good. One of the only banks left that offers pension in conjunction. You are vested in 3 years as well.
good,A typical day at work involved a steady flow of calls.  I learned a lot about account handling and opening accounts and how to take more calls in a call center setting than I had before.
good,Multi Cultural environment with a melting pot of knowledge. Company is well versed in Industry changes and updates and makes insure all employees are up to date as well.
good,"good management and work culture. opportunity for advancement, but they sometimes hire from outside or look over some older employees for younger employees who are more talented."
good,A typical day would be answering incoming calls from customers about there banking account working there I have learned to do different things all at one time the management there is great they are very caring and understanding the hardest part of the job to me is having to explain to customers where they may have went wrong on there account but the best thing about the job is getting to know customer that you never meat before and getting to know them from just a conversation
good,"what ive learned from pnc is how to respect others and their opinions"
good,"Typical day involved reporting, communicating with team members, assembling information and presenting to senior management along with explanations to variances as applicable."
good,It was overall a nice place to work at if your into saying to someone No all the time. Its nothing wrong with that at all you have to sturn and really just understand the job material.
good,"Enjoyed my job here, and my co workers. And my managers. Customers were also Great, I so enjoyed coming to work for this company, should of never left Michigan."
good,I enjoyed my time working for this company. Being able to work at a fast pace and talking and engaging with customers. While helping them with their finances.
good,"PNC Bank was an exceptional place to work. Putting our customer needs to the fore front during the day was self rewarding. Knowing that I meet and exceeded my customers need reflected in my reviews, however every day came with a new challenge which caused me to dig deeper to rectify our clients problems. Of course the paid vacation days and paid floating holidays made my job less stressful knowing I had the time to spend with family and take care of personal business."
good,"PNC is a solid, well-managed organization with excellent benefits.  Great environment for a self-motivated individual with aspirations to excel. Supporting management team led by visionary leadership team."
good,I have learned the importance of saving money and investing intelligently by working at PNC. PNC also recognizes their employees for their outstanding work ethics and offers pretty good benefits to their potential clients especially college students.
good,"I started out as a Teller, then I worked my way up to Assistant Manager. I took care of customer's deposits and cashed checks. "
good,"Exciting and growing financial services organization.  Great advancement opportunities for sharp, hard-working individuals.  Must be able to operate in a complex regulatory environment, but training is generally available - though much of it is self-directed.  Probably the best of the big banks to work for."
good,"The team environment and the supervisors and managers are very friendly and helpful in working with customers. However, due to the nature of a call center, there are numerous customers calling in every day, some of whom can be rude and unpleasant to speak with. It is important to remain professional during these calls because calls are recorded and calls are picked at random for review with your team leader."
good,Very good company to work for which PNC had a lot of great people working for them.  I learned a very great deal working with PNC on how to work with business owners.
good,Worked as a teller. Also opened/closed accounts. Offered products and service to new and existing clients. Made phone calls trying to bring new clients in
good,"PNC offers a great, fair workplace! Enjoy the morale and opportunities to grow from within. Most managers are fair and great to work for. The experience is what you make it. The more you put into it, the more you get out of it."
good,"Sales, cold calling with bank staff, worked closely with Business Banker.  "
good,This was a great company to work for. The management is professional and very fair. The customer service terrific across-the-board including telephone banking and internet services.
good,"Pros:  Professional environment, I would highly recommend.  Pay seems to be commensurate with experience.  Decent benefits.  Cons:  Seems to be an overabundance of middle management personnel"
good,Fun place to work at. Stress with back to back calls and government regulations. Managers were very supportive. Learning how the banking industry works
good,Work on your own but also worked as a team to get all the production that needed finished for the day. I learned how to push myself to get great production numbers on my own. Worked from home 3 out of 5 days a week.
good,"The work environment is great, I love they staff I work with. It; can be a bit stressful at times, because it is a demanding job when you're dealing with a persons money. All in all I would say this is one of the best jobs I've had"
good,I Loved the interaction I had with my customers on a day to day. My co-workers and managers always made the day much more fun. The managers always appreciated your time and effort that you put in to the company. The only thing that I did not like was the pay. The pay did not match the work and made it very hard to make ends meet. Other than the pay I loved working for PNC they are and will forever be family.
good,"Very Friendly environment and Professional co-workers. I enjoyed working with them.Also every body was very helpful. If anybody asking for any help, somebody step in right-way."
good,"The entire staff was amazing and helpful. They would push you to do sales, which I would never have expected for a bank teller. The staff was very helpful and knowledgeable. If you ever had a question they would go above and beyond to help you."
good,"PNC management works with their employees on the daily. From the moment you are hired management begins to assist you with your future goals with the company giving their employees the opportunity to advance. Management is also very cooperative with school schedules, therefore if you going to school while working on moving up in the company this is a great place to be."
good,"Loved working at PNC. Management was great. Had a lots of changes in last fews years. Hard part of job was Bank Products were changing too Quickly and very often, created a lots of confusion. If they increase pay rate no one would leave the company."
good,"PNC had a lot to offer, they advanced you if you show the potential , and compensation is very good, plus the benefits are equally as good"
good,"I was in a position where travel to a different property each day was required. There was something different each day and that is exciting to me. When I was in the office, my co-workers were outstanding and very friendly. Management provided good training when needed and also provided good overall guidance in my career. The 24/7 on-call schedule is the hardest part of the job, but I also like the excitement of addressing and finding solutions to on-going customer concerns and responding to emergencies situations on a 24/7 schedule. By keeping busy and doing something different each day I find property management to be very enjoyable. "
good,"Management can suck, but HR department is awesome so it makes things better. Great company along with awesome benefits for growth if you'd stay with the company."
good,Loved the people I worked with and the company took great care of it's employees. They organized a semi-annual employee appreciation week filled with events and food for us.

good,"I enjoyed working at PNC, everyone on the team was focused on delivering the highest quality service/product in a respectful working atmosphere."
good,"PNC was a nice job, the only issue I have is with they policies and procedures of running the banking business. My job was to help customers around not only their bank accounts, but also credit cards, online banking, mortgage and loans."
good,"Over the years of my diverse work history, I have developed a very special management style. I treat all my teams] members, whether they be peers or managers, with mutual respect and compassion. Because I believe that ""happy"" employees and far more productive than folks who are unhappy at their jobs, I make a point of satisfying all that is required of each person I come into contact with regardless of line of business, subordinate, or CEO. The most successful companies are always the ones who have staffing that work together and enjoy what they do. I have done my best to practice a famous tenet of the late, great Maya Angelo ""I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel."" I will always make an attempt to leave a coworker, peer, boss, team leader, call center rep, or even my regional manager with a feeling of the fact they are in great hands and the rest outcome will be the result of our interaction."
good,As a Business Underwriter I completed an analysis based on certain criteria in order to renew every business line for an additional 12 months. The most difficult part of the job was the challenging work flow and production goals. It was a joy to work at PNC as the entire business lending center projected a positive and productive attitude!  It simply was the PNC culture and I was very happy to be a member of it!
good,"PNC afforded me many opportunities to learn and grow both personally and professionally. The people are the soul of the company and it shows in the commitment to the clients, communities and shareholders."
good,"Great culture and organizational values, training, there are a lot of room for growth, work/home balance and amazing benefits ( health care, tuition reimbursement, employee discounts)."
good,"Pnc is a fun company to work for. They definitely offer room to advance, but they pay very little and their benefits are not great. Vacation time could use a boost and so could medical. Other than that, great place to work!"
good,Big bank with a small bank feel. Easy to move up in the company and everyone is extremely helpful in helping you to do so. The girls I worked with are hardworking and great coworkers. Management can use some tweeking but you have to make the most of your situation.
good,All good employees can make a difference in the company. They will give you a lot of responsibility if you request it. Management does listen to how employees believe something can be done better.
good,"I have not meet a single person at PNC who has not seemed content with their jobs. They are all very friendly and seem to have a good life/work balance. The atmosphere is welcoming and the company seems to value their employees. There is of course a lot of paperwork that needs to get done and the learning curve for their particular way of doing things is very high. There does appear to be some turn over, but it is usually from people leaving for other jobs, from what I can tell."
good,"Great job to work for, no plans on living just trying to find another job to supplement my income and that is compatible with the hours I am already working here at PNC"
good,Great place to work especially if you are looking to be somewhere and grow in your career or just grow in knowledge. The customer relationship is what makes this job most fun and rewarding.
good,Workplace is easy going and fast paced. Co-workers are very team oriented. No room for growth or raises and bonus's are minimal.
good,"I learn something new everyday from my manager or co-workers and most of all my customers."
good,"I work in a tight nit branch. I have been lucky to call PNC Bank my home for the past five years. In working as a teller, I have learned many things.  I have learned the value of helping customers achieve their finical goals. I have learned the key to a successful work environment is helping one another. In a typical 8-hour workday I have the opportunity to relate to the customers I have gotten to know over the years and see how their weekend was, and what the coming weeks is bringing them. Being a positive person is key in making my work environment enjoyable."
good,This is a great place to work. There is room for advancement and management is helpful. They also include you in decisions made. I would recommend.
good,"PNC is a great fortune 500 company to work for, especially if your looking for a place where you can grow. This company really does care about its employees."
good,Wonderful company to work for. Excel at Job Work/Life balance more than any other bank I have worked for. The only negative is the yearly compensation increases are not competitive with other banks I have worked for and the company still uses Lotus notes.
good,PNC Bank is a great company to work for. I have been fortunate to have many of my superiors support me in advancing within the company. I have also been lucky to have to ability to be cross trained not only on banker side but on teller side which has allowed me to become a teller supervisor. I very much enjoy doing many things as well as learning new things. PNC has allowed me to be very versitile. At my current location a typical day is very fast paced. The branch handles a large amount of cash deposits as well as high transaction count. I manage and coach my teller team with a very positive approach. Making sure that everyone is engaged at work and know there expectations. Customer service is key at PNC which is important to me.
good,I enjoy working face to face with clients and giving them the best advice I can for their financial well being. I enjoy most when as a team with go great in a Gallup survey and get bonuses for it.
good,"Answer phones, count vault, have meetings about getting non customers to open accounts, different scenarios to better customer service"
good,I have 21 experience with PNC and it's a great company to work for. I've been in serval different departments throughout my career with the company
good,"I have been with PNC for almost 4 years, and I have been promoted two different times since being hired. PNC recognizes great work ethic, relationship builders, and someone who really believes in the mission of the company. Being in a Management position currently, I would say the hardest part of my job is when other branches need help and we have to send an employee to their branch for the day. This creates inconsistency and we lose that employee's engagement by sending them all over the place. The most enjoyable part of my job is dealing with customers every day and helping my employees develop and grow within the company."
good,"Best Manager I could ever hope for and more.  He really looked out for us and the work life balance was great.  Upper management did not have a good eye for future decisions though and the pay for sales is abysmal.  Operations has good pay, but layoffs are common."
good,"Fast paced bank focused not only on building strong customer relationships but also on ensuring that all employees are treated fairly. Management made sure you had all the tools needed to get the job done plus would speak to you about opportunities to grow in the company and your overall development. Coworkers are great, varying personalities and generally a great environment to work in."
good,"Loved working at PNC, they are very family and community oriented.  Loved the work from home policy twice a month.  Co-workers are there for each other when needed.  The hardest part of the job was trying to learn more when no one wanted to show you.  Working there was very enjoyable and you learn alot once you get someone willing to show you new things."
good,"Just they don't really consider the fact that you have a life besides this job."
good,Banking is amazing! You learn so much about people and what they do and you become a teller-pist! ;) The business side of this bank is great. There's growth room and plenty of opportunities just for working for them!! Must be very sales oriented or just not afraid to offer people whats being marketed or to hear no! If you can stomach that then this is a great entry position.
good,Great growning company with a wonderful culture. Lots of advancement opportunities. People are friendly and everyone is willingt to help you learn and adapt.
good,Great place to work for. A lot of potential for growth. No micro-managing at this place. Freedom to explore your talents
good,Great Company.  Always busy and challenged with interesting projects.
good,I am a branch manager for PNC. I love my job and love this bank!
good,"Great place to work with solid benefits, lots of opportunity, and a fast paced yet family friendly work environment."
good,"Like most banks the environment is sales driven, but if you can handle that, then this company is great. Your goals are set clearly for you and your team so there is no confusion and it's very easy to get in contact with higher-ups if you ever needed to contact them."
good,"Is a very complicate job, you have to be aware of so many things around you, I learned to be proactive, pushing, listen to people."
good,"A typical day at PNC is being in a very fast paced, productive environment."
good,"I enjoy working here, they are very good to their employees and want to see you succeed. They are good with benefits like vacation time but could do a little better with compensation. This type of job makes you and your co-workers very close, when this happens you begin to get close with your customers as well."
good,"Deal with a lot of money. Must settle accounts to the penny. Hard work pays off. Management is able to balance intimacy with strategic planning. The overnight shift had the feel of family. The hardest part is too many people are out , because their work has to be done as well, but it's doable. I enjoyed the culture of the organization the most."
good,"Sit at a desk all day and analyze collection. Co workers were great, learned a lot about collections.  The one thing I can say about PNC is that there is always something to learn."
good,"Great place to work"
good,Employees and managers are warm and friendly.  Flexible with appointments and family.  Opportunities to learn something new every day.
good,"In my opinion PNC is a great company. To interact with a customer on a day to day basis. Is one of the greatest things you can do in life. Managing peoples money may be stressful at times but, when you let them know they have more than what they though it gives you great joy. A typical day at work you would come in balanced from the night before, check emails, and make sure you have the right materials to start you day. The hardest part of the job is telling someone they over drafted their account because they didn't pay close enough attention."
good,"I have always wanted to work for PNC, so when I finally got a call for an interview I was excited and ready to go. Before I got the job I was claiming it was mine. There are so many people in the company that want you to succeed and assist you with moving up. The only thing that bothers me is the way management is set up."
good,worked as a teller loved my job but had to leave husband's job relocated to texas
good,"•	Process routine account transactions. Open accounts, including savings and checking."
good,"I love my job at PNC because of my coworkers. They have become very close friends and it makes this company a great place to work. Managers listen and are understanding, I always feel that my opinion matters. It seems that fellow employees are constantly earning promotions and building their careers. This is a fantastic company to work for if banking is the desired field."
good,"My daily duties included deposits, payments, address changes and general customer service inquiries."
good,"A typical day at work starts out with a quick start where we share a positive tip or idea for the day. I then make follow up phone calls, running transaction when needed, and pull reports for the monthly file. I have learned to manage a teller line by coaching to ensure the tellers reach their personal goals to help improve the banks over all sales. With managing I have also learned how to understand co-workers personalities and how to approach co-workers the right way to get the task done right the first time. The hardest part of my job is making cold calls for sales opportunities. I would much rather pitch a product that I believe would truly help my clients financial well-being, rather than just pushing any product. The most enjoyable part of being a teller supervisor is being able to help my clients with their financial troubles, and I also enjoy managing the cash on hand at the branch to ensure we have great customer service."
good,Great employer and a great learning and advancement work place.
good,"This was a new experience for me,  I have a lot of good co-workers, I took a lot of responsibilities."
good,"PNC has been a wonderful employer and I do not want to leave the company or my team of employees but there are no careers available for me in this area that allow me to use my degrees, knowledge, experience, and drive to my full potential."
good,"A typical day is exciting and rewarding. I enjoy being a resource and gaining the respect of the employees and customers. What I've learned is each day bring new challenges, but with an open mind, morals and integrity you can overcome anything. The direct management and through out the chain of command are very supportive. The hardest part of the job is pleasing everyone. The most enjoyable part of the job is for everyone you can not please there is at least one who appreciates and respects all that you can do and that makes it all worth it."
good,"Great place to work, team environment, great co-workers. Each day was different as I worked with 2 Regional Managers, and 26 branches. I was responsible for approving payroll, coordinating training, approving and submitting expense reports, arranging travel when necessary, pulling reports and many other duties as required."

good,"I had went into work my usual shift, expected a normal day. When I arrive to work we are short staff due to a teller calling out sick. My supervisor had report's to get done, there was several other task to complete. I worked the teller line alone as well as prepared all coin orders, process two ATM machines that day. That was a very busy day for me, I felt like I worked alone the whole day."

good,Had the best co workers every! The hardest part of my job was trying to stay above water when the economy went bad.
good,"Most of my responsibilities for overall management of outside law firms, work-outs and direct contact with loan officers and senior managers of diverse business units were immediately restricted when PNC acquired RBC Bank. I was assigned to assist in the transition of one business unit and its ultimate liquidation, and quickly relegated to handling a small task that I had previously delegated to other paralegals and support staff."
good,I have worked for PNC less than a year. The position is only part time. I am not able to take advantage of all the benefits PNC has to offer due to me being only part time.
good,Hardest part of the job is the repetitive stuff-It is not really hard but frustrating having to constantly re-educate service partners on bank procedures and policies
good,A typical day at PNC? Honestly there isn't one. Each loan package we process is different. There is always something that may need research a bit further before the loan can be set up.

I have built a friendly environment with my co-workers and have enjoyed my stay with the bank.

I have loved and have enjoyed my job and in fact I continually improve myself for me to effectively perform my work.

good,"When in the proper environment with a strong team, this job can be competitive, but collaborative and fun! The universal model that PNC is shifting towards gives a great opportunity to advance sales, but can be difficult when having to focus on teller capabilities too.

Then as the day progressed I would assist customers with their financial needs and make some outbound sales calls.  I learned more about the banking field. The management at PNC was great, always willing to help you and always had an open door policy. My co-workers became like family to me and were there to bounce ideas off of. The hardest part about the job was when I had to explain to a customer why I could not refund them any fees.

Kept track of tellers work and make sure they were adhering the cash policies on drawer limits Scheduling tellers for a month at a time. We had a lot of turn overs mostly because of college scheduling issues.  That made scheduling the hardest part of the job since we were shorthanded and I had to adhere to proper coverage at all times.My favorite part was going to work everyday and working with our team members but by far it was the customers.  If a customer came in with a frown and then they left with a smile...I did my job!
good,I loved working for PNC Bank because they actually care about the customers needs as well as the employees needs.

Now I can't speak for every PNC Bank branch, but I know at my location it is a dream job come true."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is to spend a work day with people that are not only co-workers but friends at work. They are people that are willing to help me in everything I might need help with during my time at work. Having a manager that not only cares about my success at work but my success with the company is also very enjoyable. I had the blessing of working for a branch near home, and the best part of this is to work to assist customers that I already know. It gives me a feeling of satisfaction to know that my customers believe in me. They never hesitate to ask for anything because they know I am always willing to answer any questions they might have.

good,PNC offer a large spectrum of training and knowledge enhancement.
good,"*Small department"
good,Working at PNC was a greet experience to learn and meet great customers. Easy to give excellent customer service with the training given. The goals were tough to meet at times but if we as a branch stopped competing with each other and we started completing  each other by helping with goals to be reached.. I had a great manager and friend. Always willing to help and train.
good,This is a place were you can learn a lot about the ins and outs of financial planning
good,"I started out in the Data Entry Department and quickly moved over to the mail in, mail out department, this was on an as needed basis. I was also trained in a third position as a check extractor. This job was located in the bank's lockbox facility. Every day was different since I worked in three departments. There was never a dull moment and I greatly enjoyed working there."
good,A typical day at PNC Bank included processing various transactions for customers. Performing account maintenance and resolving customer issues is a huge part of delivering great customer service for myself and my former coworkers. Management worked well with the tellers and supervision and guidance was always available. The hardest part of the job was the low staffing we were allocated which made it difficult to deliver fast customer service for the clients. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers and making banking easy for them.

good,I loved that job over all.I enjoyed helping customers.Eager to learn new things every day.
good,"A typical night is productive and very busy at times. I am crossed trained in various departments within the operations department and can run the Itran area without supervision. Majority of my co-workers are team players. My job is easy, if I have to add a hard part I guess it would be reading some of the hand writing on the checks."
good,"Great management. Chances to move up. Flexible schedule. Hardest part of the job was to meet account goals, but it is manageable."
good,"Typical day at work was well managed, with sufficient amount of work that would make you feel accomplised but not stressed. Load leveling in busier times was well managed. All employees and managment were treated with respect. Your opinion mattered."
good,"I worked in a private branch in a retirement community where personal relationships are a must. Most seniors enjoyed the convenience of having a personal private branch in their own community. I learned to treat the elderly with patience and compassion, as well as seeing a business and a relationship opportunity on every issue. Management was excellent.

The training was not as good as it should have been and on-the-job-training was hard to do with everyone with a client and not having someone to help you.  That slowed me down a bit.  My branch was Universal, meaning you worked all aspects of banking.  Teller, platform, and lobby.  Great concept, but hard to do in reality.  However, those that can be persistent and can close sales, you will make a boatload of money.  I loved helping customers.  I didn't like trying to sell to customers unless I knew it would help them out.  Banks are a business and I hate I couldn't be that person they wanted me to be, but they supported me and gave me all sorts of help in trying to make me a better banker.
