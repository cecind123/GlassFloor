rating,review
bad,There was never any feedback about my performance or any guidance to know exactly what was expected.   Local management was all male and the only other woman in the office was a troublemaker who disliked me.
bad,"Very poorly run.  Cut corners on safety.   Supervisors were not of a high caliber.  I would not recommend working for them., "
bad,"Not a company I would work for again. They do not treat females the same as males. They are not fair in how the distribute bonuses. I am not sure why I have to say anything to move on "
bad,Management is embarrassing my first boss got fired for refusing a drug test. We had a guy quit but since he was friends with a boss there he got rehired as our foremen. Rehired three positions higher than when he QUIT! One boss was so drunk all the time they transferred him to another location.
bad,"If you're white, chew tobacco, and smoke cigarettes, you will go far in Anadarko.. if you're not white, a hard worker, and mind you're own business, you will always be left at the bottom.. Anadarko management are 99% anglo, and only cater, and favor to anglos... you can be white, lazy, and not do your work, and it's perfectly ok, cause you're the right skin color... I thought discrimination in the workplace  was over, but it is not.. it's alive and well in Anadarko"
bad,"I was a consultant here for 2.5 years and was treated very poorly.  I have been in the oil and gas industry for over 30 years and was never treated like this.  Not sure if it was because I was a consultant?  I've heard this about other companies but never experienced it before.  I was told this was a temp to hire position and even though my direct supervisor recommended that they hire me, several times, they never did.  They culture was odd as well.  There were many people I enjoyed working with but several people with personality disorders there.  NOT a great working environment.  It's now Oxy and they continue to have layoffs.  I would not work here again unless I was desperate."
bad,"It's not about the product anymore, it's about how you make yourself look the best to not get fired.  Culture is in the toilet and they don't respect DJ Basin anymore."
bad,"While I am sure other departments treat their contractors professionally, I did not have that experience.  I would never work for this company either as a contractor or permanent employee.  There is definite retaliation and favoritism."
bad,"As with most O&G companies, APC (now Oxy) cares about 1 thing and one thing only. How much money can we make. For a company that preached people and passion, that train left the station a long long time ago. Over the last 5 years I had worked with ANADARKO for approx 3 of them. While they paid the bills, I never felt a sense of security or worth. There are a few people that actually care about others well being, but most don’t. If you have other options pursue those"
bad,"APC is very large corporate entity.  Many changes, many employees.  Could transfer to different areas, cities, travel abroad."
bad,"Culture is very different from other O&G companies in the Houston area. Minimal focus on safety, competitive pay, and advancement. Managers seem to have limited vision."
bad,"good benefits, and great employee services such as gyms and cafeterias, there is a cult like loyalty which can be hard to become part of the inner circle.  As will all oil and gas, its bust to boom.   In January of 2016 they bought their fourth corporate Jet and hired a Hunting guide for the Executive hunting property but in march they let off one thousand, sixteen hundred employees in one day."
bad,Company is a shell of what is was. APC was always good at field development. It has sold most of its fields. It has retained a big company mentality powerpoint inefficient management structure. It is a development co/managerial processes top heavy company that  needs to shrink by half and change its culture.
bad,Big corporations have their role in the world. This cookie didn't fit the cookie cutter. My boss didn't like my ideas especially when they were out of the box.
bad,"Had to go to other Dept. to find out what new installs were coming up, but my Supervisor had time to ride me about little things and watch me on GPS and satellite. Had over 2 hours drive time no pay everyday. No  structured training would have to call coworkers for help."
bad,This was a temp job that I did when I first moved to Pennsylvia.  I really liked this job but for some reason I was let go. I was to bill customers for there time and labor.
bad,Management dedicated to promoting a from Houston. Personalities instead of work record was determining factors on whether you stayed in operations. Work life balance was not where it needed to be for me. Overall poor department that I worked in.
bad,This used to be a great company to work for.  Upper management needs a change.  Very political.  I wouldn't recommend working here unless you are just starting out and need the experience.
bad,Productive and fun workplace. I loved working at this company.
bad,Lots of changes. Many employees left a few years back. Close to many good shoping and dining locations. Seems to be growing.
good,"I think the company is good but the management in the DJ Basin is poor and is running it into the ground. Wasteful spending and poor management. With the layoff of most Colorado employees to make room for the Wyoming ones, I should have seen the direction of the company."
good,A couple of nice people but all and all a very weird vibe. Not to mention right after I left that guy murdered his wife and kids and dropped them at an oil rig. So that is creepy.
good,"great work atmosphere until you get thrown under the bus without any further explanation and released from an assignment."
good,"I enjoyed contractor management but the inspector team isn’t really a team. Keep your head down and don’t make waves and you’ll be alright.  Keep your head on a swivel, high stakes, big money, people change."
good,"I saw a great career advancement opportunity when coming into this role, but since I have been here, the company culture has slowly degraded and chances for advancement or promotions have significantly decreased."
good,"Too many relatives, at one time I knew of four people from one family working there.It actually had brought this up and was quickly dismissed as mind your own business.Had an incident where somebody who had more exp. than me created a hazardous incident I quickly brought this to his attention,I was reprimanded,because he immediately called my supervisor about they way I handled the situation.{ told him he was incompetent}.I found out later that they were brother-in-laws."
good,"It was a stressful atmosphere of feeling like you were under a microscope all the time and in everything you do. Supervisors prefered almost non-comunication with contractors which lead to one not knowing what was expected of you, lot's of confusion with guidelines. Distinct feeling of separt treatment of non-employees. You were expendable if you are not an employee and always felt like you were insugnificant. Employee abuse of non-employees and no outlet to resolve any issues."
good,I witnessed both great comraderie and teamwork along with office politics that contributed to the downward spiral of the business.  The distinction between full time employees versus contractors was reiterated time and time again.
good,Job was fine. Culture was fine. Learning was fine. Typical days were fine. events were fine. Leadership was fine. Management was fine. It was a fine job.
good,"I work as a Measurement Technician working on various Oil/Gas field locations. I have learned a lot of skills working with various types of Meters and learning about the fast pace, ever changing world of measurement."
good,Workin here was fun and exciting for the most part.  Has it’s up and downs. Downside of it is all the meetings.  It’s a good environmental experience to work outside and be home by 4 PM.
good,Overall a positive experience.  Anadarko is a strong company well positioned for future growth and is currently adapting to the evolving business conditions in the industry.
good,Great place to work. Benefits are top notch and work environment is relaxed. Campus makes it easy to mange work and home life. Only down fall is the good old boy mentality.
good,Anadarko has a diverse portfolio which allows for extensive movement between assets throughout a your career.  This is not all that common in many other independent companies.
good,"Very good pay and working conditions, working hours, good parking, close to the Woodlands. Int'l Travel pay was good. A lot of interesting people worked there."
good,"Learned new systems, learned how to code 300 invoices a week.  Working environment was fun and relaxed.  Great work life home balance.  Loved all the perks that came with the job.  Never going to find a company that rewards their employees for doing their job."
good,Truly enjoyed my job. The part I enjoyed most was the constant interaction with executive management to discuss forward strategy and discussing the variance drivers of financial performance and collaborating on forward resolution
good,"Involved in gathering business requirements from the end users and management."
good,"Great place to work.  Effective safety culture, ability to learn and provide input into daily construction activities.  Management oversight was in the best interest of their employees"
good,This is a great company with great benefits. I learned all about the air quality side of the oil and gas industry. Permitting is partially and art and the other following direction.
good,"Many positions are filled with contract workers with no permanent status offered - or not offered until contract position held for 3+ years."
good,"APC has the resources to be a leader in industry, not many operators in the DJ have quite the horsepower Anadarko does.  Engineers are world class in my experience, and as far as tech goes they are years ahead of their counterparts.  Their fatal flaw lies in their management, who are pedestrian at best compared to their tech and engineering.  Middle management is staffed with former operators who may have been great at operations but have no understanding of employee development or leadership."
good,"Working in the gas and oil industry has been a great opportunity.  The work schedule and perks are unbeatable.  My job challenges me and gives me the freedom to act as an ""owner"" of my route.  It gives me a feeling of accountablility and responsibility."
good,Good environment with great people. Everyone was very friendly and day to day work was interesting and challenging. You do have some weeks when you are on call that limit your personal activities but overall worth it.
good,"I was only an intern, but the company seemed good. Too political and seemed to treat IT staff as outcasts though."
good,"People were friendly and the benefit was great. people are proud of working there. They are trying to work a team, and share the information together to have a better performance."
good,"Pay was good, but consider, job was located in the desert of west Texas, 30 t0 35 miles from closet town of any size < 1800 pop.and 65 miles from any large city Odessa Texas. Makes for a long commute."
good,Extremely high paying but zero time for yourself.  Work and home life have absolutely no balance.  Great job but sold to Oxy so Anadarko is no more.  Time for a career change
good,"Career advancement was slow for employees with exceptional skills.  Having said that, the work was challenging and there are ample opportunities to increase skills and participate in complex projects."
good,I liked the culture and my colleagues but I was not too keen on management philosophy and the lack of opportunities to advance. My skill set and work ethic demanded better pay and some type of career advancement. I did appreciate the very nice bonuses but I needed a better base salary and I just wasn’t going to get it there.
good,"This company has a great set of Core Values. However, they are very poorly displayed and I have seen them used selfishly. I have witnessed the values being used to gain promotion, but at that very same time used to knock others down. The culture is very cut throat and doesn't feel like one team. There is a significant amount of separation between teams and not much of anything being done to bring everyone together to collaborate."
good,The workplace culture is great and a bunch of great people. Management are very secretive and job advancement is very minimal. Very cliquish with management and some employees. Very political.
good,Too many changes and performance goals to handle always changing. I learned a ton about core values. learned that they really dont care about what you have done when things get hard.y
good,"There are many days when the pay does not account for the work you do, yet there are days that are very easy and make up for the hard days. Management can be very distant at times."
good,"It's a good thing that Oxy bought Anadarko, as the company was a sinking ship.  At the end, management would only hire/promote individuals that didn't disagree with them.  With bad ideas from management, it didn't take long for this once great company to fail; since no one was allowed to disagree with them."
good,Nice fun place to work until you get moved and get a bad boss.  Some people are not meant to be in manger positions.  They do not have the personality for it.
good,"I got tired of working in O&G. If that's what you want to do this place is as good as any. Good benefit, lots of PTO. If you have a good manager, you are lucky!"
good,Understanding and reviewing JOA's and coding accounting transactions for the JIB statement.  Great exposure to drilling activities.  Overwhelming a lot of times.  Loved it!
good,"This is a great place to work with lots of amenities, but they run a lean ship so you have to wear a ton of hats and you work the hours.  They will send you all over the place."
good,Good company to work for but it's definitely getting larger and more bureaucratic. Provides lots of training opportunities for less experienced employees.
good,"Anadarko is an ok place to work for.  The company does attempt to maintain a positive work environment; this the best part of the company.  Overall, I would recommend Anadarko as a good place to work."
good,"a lot of training, if your not a favorite, you will not go very far, watch your reviews, can get sticky, depends on your manager if they like you. The operators, most of them are great to get along with."
good,"I feel the company has grown so much and so fast, with corporate VP's and upper management not having field oil and gas experience, they have lost focus on where their product comes from. They pay well with good benefits, especially at the corporate offices, but the stress in the field not getting the same benefits, work/life balance, and focus on production first to meet corporate expectations, rather than be consistent with their core values, this has given them instability. Too many programs being carried out to accomplish someone's review goals, rather than using the common sense strategy. But overall a very good company to work for."
good,I have learned a great deal in my current position. I feel that I have reached the maximum potential possible with the company.
good,"Good place to work good people to work with and for."
good,they are fair do your job and they will pay you for what you do they dont give you much time to  be with family but will keep you working and there safety is a good thing
good,"Very positive work environment with minimal oversight."
good,Anadarko Petroleum has a good working environment and Engineers were given the opportunity to look at new technology and apply new ideas in areas where it proved to be cost-effective.
good,Good coworkers. The culture and job always seemed to change. Dealing with management could be difficult at times. Learned and accomplished a lot.
good,Busy everyday trying to get the daily task completed. Learned the government agencies policies. Management was constantly changing and could be difficult to work with. Had some of the best coworkers which made the job un.
good,Loved a typical day at work. There was always something different to do and learn. The people I worked with were amazing. Each day there was always something to look forward to.
good,"This job was good and was great for a learning curve on how other companies helped with quality control of data sent electronically.  But to get so many of them done in a day was almost impossible but some seem to think the had eyes of superman."
good,Great place to work. All of the people were nice and they always taught new things.
good,Apesar dos terceirizados não desfrutarem dos mesmos benefícios era uma empresa com muitas pessoas boas para trabalhar.
good,"Loved working for Anadarko until a change in management."
good,"I was laid off in 2016 along with a lot of people. Prior to the lay-off, I was pleased with the PTO allocation, supplemented café and the work environment. My manager at the time was out of touch with the support staff and could have used some managerial guidance. I am thankful that he didn't micromanage though. I probably would have stayed there if there hadn't been cut-backs."
good,Many challenges if you are willing to put in the work.  Anadarko has great individuals as well as not so great individuals.  I would recommend Anadarko to anyone wanting a rewarding career.
good,"Management made the department culture confusing and frustrating."
good,"Reviewing the cost forecast, auditing invoices and forecasting resources needed for the up coming work associated with the project."
good,"Good people to work with. I took a lot of lessons from the internship. Unfortunate that it didn't turn into a full time offer, but I really think I like Denver more than the company..."
good,"Good work environment, fun people to be around during the work day. Flexible for the most part. Just a long commute to and from work was my main issue as well as being a contract role."
good,"I have got a wonderful experience with the company and learned a lot in the logistics operations. had online training with insider network sessions."
good,"i am contractor here."
good,"A independent  mechanic and operator , self motivated and directed."
good,Is a good website really easy to understand and find the job you want  is a good place I recommend to everyone it was a really good workplace and good management
good,"APC was a great place to work BEFORE the O&G downturn.  Since then the ""old timers' with irreplaceable knowledge were severed along with young, forward thinking  recent graduates.  What is left is mostly middle career people with mediocre management skills clambering for position.  The balance is gone!  Then, they lost much of the talent with a required relocation to Midland.  Still a desirable place to work, but understand the recovery will take a few years."
good,"Great location in the Woodlands. Office and amenities are excellent. Very smart and cool people."
good,Management changes impact on culture not positive.  Great people to work with.  Most enjoyable part of day was working with field operations or being on location.
good,Meetings where you feel you are making a difference. Team work atmosphere and considerable interaction with management.
good,"Normal work day consisted of supervising contract employees work a twelve hour shift.  With the down turn of the oil and gas industry, I am looking into entering another field."
good,Performed all maintenance on pipeline after the meter. Launched and received pipeline cleaners. Coordinated blow down procedures for new line connects as well as existing line modifications.Breaking line freezes in the winter.
good,"A typical day at work consists of driving to job site, and supervising "
good,"Great company to work for. "
good,It was a good experience. It was difficult working in Gillette at times living out of a hotel room and working in the field but I learned a lot and was able to assist the team with the maps I created and work I did. The management was very kind and hard working and I had a wonderful experience in the Woodlands preparing to head north. It is an overall very good company.
good,"My manager provided me opportunities to work on new and brownfield projects. He trusted me to independently work on artificial lift projects and, appreciated my work and efforts to complete with improvements on various assignments and projects."
good,"Too bad it had to end due to the Oxy acquisition, as I was hoping to retire an Anadarko employee.  I enjoyed 5 years there through up times and down.  Enjoyed an innovative and forward thinking culture, which is now gone with the Oxy acquisition."
good,Long days while you are working in the Gulf but the time off is amazing.  Two weeks on and two weeks off with PTO.  I knew nothing going to the production side but the people i worked with took the time to show me the ropes and hoe things flowed.  Great group of people on the platform i worked on for five years.
good,Anadarko provides IT support service to many customers at various government sites. The workplace is very busy. The lunch hours are short. The employees get the federal government holidays off.
good,"excellent place to get started, good company, too much red tape.  Takes too long to make valuable changes.  Company is strong but loses a lot of money due to delays and red tape involving suggestions to improve operations."
good,It was a great company to work for overall. The compensation was very great and the worklife pto was amazing. Entry level operator I/ tech I salaries are 70-75k with 6% 401k match. Along with 4 weeks vacation at minimum which is based off your age and experience.There are alot of perks  available to the employees as well on the company site.Annually bonuses  are received based off your performance and other goals as well. They are pretty nice!
good,Anadarko was a challenging and rewarding workplace with an emphasis on core values and a commitment to charitable giving in the local community.
good,Many moving parts to this company and they all pull their weight well. I enjoy working for them and wish that times would not be changing. Have nothing bad to say.
good,Anadarko is a great place workplace. The work/life balance and benefits are nearly impossible to beat. Be weary of constant commodity changes.
good,I have really enjoyed working at Anadarko. Oxydental has purchased the company and things are not quite the same. I have wanted to work for Anadarko ever since moving to The Woodlands but right now things are in flux after the acquisition.
good,People were respectful and willing to work as a team. Managers have been in those positions for year so change is slowly happening. The benefits were excellent.
good,"Over all a great place to work. Sad that we were bought out. However, Oxy seems to be doing the best they can to move things along as fast as possible."
good,"Recommend as a great company to work for, if you can get in - lots of applicants for nearly every position means stiff competition. And not many want to leave, so opportunities can be scarce."
good,I didn't really work with Anadarko very long but they were good to me and I loved the people. They were a great company to work for. I was working for Anadarko when Pioneer hired me back which my boss told me he thought its was a good move for me and only a few months later they closed the doors in Amarillo.
good,Good company to work for while things while oil was booming.  Discussion were often and open about operations and project management.  Engineers assigned to project had no experience in project management and MPD operations. Work was completed on the rig during drilling operations without interruption of drilling program.
good,Anadarko is  great place to work. They are good to their employees and help them grow in their career.  I was lucky to spend 16 years with them.  Throughout my time with them I moved from accounting to records management to operations and was able to learn many aspects of the oil and gas business.
good,"Overall, a great company to work for. Like all oil and gas companies recently, the culture has taken a bit of a hit since the fall of oil prices a few years ago. The culture is recovering, and management is doing their best to reward employees for sticking through it. No work from home optionality, which is a benefit when you think about work-life balance. The 9/80 schedule is phenomenal! The dress attire is business casual, which keeps the environment professional yet not overly formal. With the right attitude and work ethic, it's a company you can excel and advance at!"
good,"Typical work day would consist of facility design review and PSSR, commissioning and start-up scheduling, along with facility maintenance. Corresponded with Midstream and Production Foremen to address site automation and control issues."
good,Great place. Great company. Great culture. Good work life balance. Was able to come in early and leave to get my children off of the bus which is great
good,Anadarko was/is a great company to work for and they do care about their employees. I would recommend the Sea Bass to fish lovers everywhere.
good,Anadarko is a company that truly lives their values. They may be a smaller oil and gas company but they really have something special when it comes to knowing how to make their employees valued.
good,This was a contractual project but I had a awesome experience. Great management and staff. You got the chance to see how the oil & gas industry works from within.
good,"Client representative to monitor compliance with all various governmental, state and local regulatory permits, including personal contact with designated officials. Projects consisted of Detailed Design; Construction and Commissioning phases to include coordinating all construction, environmental, welding and multiple other pipeline construction activities."
good,I was a company man for APC and had about three hounded well on my lease and work over seventy hours a week. However that is how I learned automation so fast so no complaints.
good,"Anadarko is located in The Woodlands, Texas. A very high-level, beautiful place to work. It is walking distance of the mall, has restaurants to meet all budgets and provides a very professional environment for its employees."
good,i was hired as a temporary data entry for this company.  It was a great company and I would have liked to stay with company.
good,"I was a contractor, but I know the employees there really enjoy the company and the benefits the company offers. Great Oil and Gas company and leader in the field."
good,"Great place to work, learned a lot in my 6 years from coworkers and my team. There's so many perks you can achieve at both of the buildings and if you take advantage take training."
good,I enjoy working at Anadarko Petroleum. For the most part the people are great to work with. The work balance is awesome. They work you and your family needs and for the most part it is really laid back.
good,"Positive working environment with professionals spanning many disciplines ( geologists, procurement specialists, quality assurance personnel, welding engineers etc.)"
good,"Working at Anadarko was a very friendly environment, and learned a lot working with this company. Family came first with Anadarko, communication was good. Anadarko also gave their employers great opportunities to improve."
good,"The company has changed in the last few months.  The layoffs were hard, people are still trying to figure out the new normal.  "
good,"In the 15 years i was at APC there were many ups and downs, but overall I believe there was no better company to work for. Really going to miss that place."
good,"Fun company to work for. I have enjoyed every moment worked for this company. Great people and friends. Excellent management, great learning opportunities. Career growth opportunities"
good,Demanding and dangerous work! I didn't like working overnight but I was good at my job regardless. I could figure out how things work and what the issue was with a piece of equipment in a matter of minutes.
good,I was paid well and the benefits were great. I think with the recent commodity environment things will change under Oxy. more than likely worse due to the competitive environment
good,"Awesome team. Everyone is so helpful! "
good,Anadarko was a great company but it was acquired by Oxy in 2019 and no longer exists. I spent 8 good years there working on interesting projects and with a solid team of professionals.
good,"Saya ingin kerja di anadarko petroleum, bisa ditempatkan di mana saja, saya lulusan SMK, saya menunggu kabar baik datang"
good,"Fun place to work with great opportunities for growth and development. Very friendly and accommodating staff, and located in a safe and beautiful neighborhood."
good,Awesome work enviroment with great people focused driven team to occomplish goals very rewarding. I would deffintley reccomend this company as a employer.
good,This was my first corporate American job since leaving the federal government.  They treated me well and upper management believes in the culture they strive to achieve.
good,"Read and analyzed oil & gas leases, entered specific data into computer system.  Trained and mentored other analysts."
good,Anadarko has a 9/80 work schedule that was wonderful.  My co-workers were all great friends. It was a wonderful atmosphere to work.
good,Learned a lot from Anadarko and have enjoyed all the experiences I had. Great company to work for and would recommend this company to others. Very productive and hard working coworkers.
good,The environment is wonderful. The people are great and fun to work with. The work is always changing so you don't get bored. There is constantly a challenge to keep you on your toes.
good,"understanding, safety minded, care about their employees"
good,This was a great place to work.  I would go back.  I would recommend this company to anyone.  The people there are great! Great work/life balance.  All around great company.
good,A great place to work that gives great learning opportunities for different subjects in the industry.
good,"I loved working at Anadarko.  Would never have left I didn't have to.  My co-workers were like family.  The benefits were amazing.  And, I didn't feel like I was a prisoner there.  It was a very busy atmosphere, but that kept my adrenaline going and I learned a lot.  Anadarko taught me how to learn and train and be inquisitive."
good,"Offers great opportunities for advancement, skill enhancement, job challenges, proficient management, great benefits, beautiful offices and surrounding environments"
good,The staff at Anadarko were very amazing and patient with giving a tour of the office. The workplace culture is very nice and the ideal perfect place to work at. Though I only was given a very short internship thanks to my school.
good,Company was very focused on work/life benefits.  Great compensation and PTO.  Work was challenging and enjoyable.  I ended up in a dead end job due to I don't know!
good,"Anadarko is considered one of the top places to work in Houston, mainly because the great compensation, benefits, onsite cafeteria, and on site gym.  The tradeoff is the work life balance."
good,"Worked there as a contractor for more than seven years. Downside as a contractor is that you get treated somewhat like a second-class citizen, but I think that is mostly because of legal requirements. World-class organization otherwise."
good,"Coworkers were great, loved working with everyone and enjoyed my job.  low stress environment yet allowed me to focus on my work and could get my job finished.  Only con is that Anadarko does not hire temps/contractors."
good,"I was given a great deal of responsibility for a “bet the company” type of project that company was undertaking.  We were able to achieve FID, ahead of industry expectations and in spite numerous challenges and obstacles.  It was truly a “once in career” type of role - although I am seeking to be similarly challenged again in my next role."
good,If I had the opportunity I was consider working for a great company like Anadarko again. They provided detailed information on tasks and updated drawing to follow up on.
good,"Typical day involved writing permits, monitoring safety and ensuring that Anadarko standards are met. Safety is a top priority at Anadarko Petroleum. Company has many experienced managers and superintendents."
good,The people at this company are amazing and the benefits are good too! They really take care of their employees and want them to succeed. Some of the best managers and coworkers I've ever had.
good,Great company to work for. Benefits are excellent and our unit had great work/life balance. Our unit was an international unit so lots of travel and travel policy was fair and balanced.
good,"Managed oil wells and maintained central gathering facilities"
good,"Comp and Benefits at Anadarko were amazing. The facilities and amenities were fantastic, too and the people that work there make it a wonderful place to come to work every day."
good,"Great place to work. The job was exciting and always a fun place to be with wonderful people. Its to bad the company was sold to Oxy, as things have changed, but again most the people are Anadarko folks, so it should be a great environment to be in as well."
good,"Anadarko Petroleum was a large family. If Oxy had not acquired Anadarko, I would still be employed by Anadarko. The people and passion made the job enjoyable."
good,Anadarko as a company was fantastic to work for. Great benefits with a workplace culture second to none. Very fun and enjoyable place of employment during my tenure.
good,"Leader in the industry, has recently been purchased by larger oil and gas company and is currently Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY).  Excellent  benefits, retirement savings, medical and dental plans."
good,I loved working at Anadarko because it was a well respected company.  They had great benefits and work life balance was very important. It was really great working with everyone there.
good,I retired from Anadarko in 2016.  The company has been bought out by Oxy.  I enjoyed working for Anadarko and I feel I was treated very well.  I do not care to add my salary but I was well compensated.
good,"Great experience growing as a geologist over the past 6 years. Learnt many things that will travel with me throughout my career."
good,Great place to work.  The most vacation ever received. Management was good.  FR's supplied as well as prescription safety glasses.  large boot allowance each year.
good,"Work environment fast passed but yet collaborative. We worked as a team but yet given the freedom to make decision, fail but yet learn from them. Company was changing prior to my departure."
good,I loved working here and hated that it was only a temporary job. I did not want to leave and would definitely go back if given the chance. I loved working in this environment!
good,"Good Structure, great place to work"
good,"Worked on contract, would love to work there again. Did some IT work and helped upgrade systems.  Great manager and team members and great job to work on."
good,Loved working there and would still be there but was laid off due to the downturn in commodity prices. That's why I only gave it two stars for job security.
good,"It was a grate place to work, they just did not bring people on full company though. Work day was not stressful if you knew how to prioritize, management was ok some of them were not there to teach, but a lot of them would sit with you and explain every aspect of the equipment  down to the smallest bolt. the hardest part of the job is dealing with the hurry up and wait on parts. the most enjoyable part of the job is the people and family you pick up from working side by side with them for so long. even if you work with them for a few months they welcome you in to the job like family."

Despite creating various process and projects that have created value for the company, I am pretty much where I am going to be until I retire unless I go get a petroleum engineering degree.  The company supports people going back and getting more education so this is something that can be fixed if a person is willing to go back and do it.
