rating,review
bad,Many challenging metrics. People are nice . Work is challenging. System sometimes don't work. It's normal. Stressful at times. Fun also.  U learn new platform and engage with different time of people.
bad,"This company started off good but ended bad. The schedules are stressful, the environment was stressful. You can make money but the money isn't everything."
bad,"Hated this job I didn’t make it out of training, I mean u had to keep a certain amounts of good surveys to keep the job I mean this come was ridiculous to me couldn’t stay and would not have two girl that I was training with said they stayed to the and said they eventually lost there one because they could of get surveys"
bad,Tiene prestigio la firma pero no hay desarrollo personal y demasiado stress por hacer q los clientes gasten las tarjetas
bad,Considering people as slave they are bounding you to work over hours without paying anything for the same.. Ruining you on both physical and mental ends..
bad,Grosse arnaque j ai travailler 1 ans cher eux il mon proposé de devenir manager je fessais du 6 h 15 h pour gagner presque rien il te dit que ta un cdi au bout de 6 mois mais au bout de 6 moi tu n'a pas de quoi vivre grosse arnaque salaire médiocre manipulation
bad,"Much too strict.  Only a few minutes to use the restroom.  Definitely NOT enough time to eat your food during your lunch or dinner break.  "
bad,They get you in use you and spit you out! Never felt like my job was secure even when I performed well which was most of the time. Good experience for college grad fresh out of school but a family man needs more stability and more feeling of I belong.
bad,"Leadership was incompetent and would pawn agents off on others, you had to make unrealistic quotas in order to get a bonus that was not worth it. High call volumes but never hired new people or opened overtime."
bad,toxic environment that will break you down and make you unhappy to be around people best to move forward and look for a better environment typically high turnaround
bad,"greedy company that doesn't treat their employee as deserved, no rewards, no sick pays, but a lot of stress and surveillance even when you do more than your job. they ask always more but they dont give. avoid this place."
bad,"This company has outdated computers from the 70’s. The management was a revolving door and each new manager knew less about the parameters of the job, and that was the US based employees. They began outsourcing everything which led to this company’s demise  Advancement was encouraged and nobody stayed on the job long enough to help new employees. Every dayday was spent fielding complaints about off shore employees making mistakes and creating problems."
bad,"Seems great when 1st starting. Very heavy sales not told this in interview. Heavy survey focused, must convince angry customers to still like Amex to not be dinged or you must simply lie and pass along customer to next agent to avoid the penalty.  This went against my ethics.  Very stressful position but great pay. You work for every penny."
bad,"They treat you like a number and fire you for anything. The survey system is not  fair and affects your bonus, which they take away for any reason they come up with."
bad,If American express was smart they would snatch the campaign from Telus immediately because it's being ran by a bunch of idiots. They only promote you if they're your friends there's a lot of unethical treatment and a lot of favoritism and nepotism going around the training department is a complete farce
bad,Horrible work environment. Manager was just mean and vindictive. Wish I had never accepted the offer. Not what was promised. Absolutely no balance. Very disappointed.
bad,American Express should reconsider their Human Resources team. One particular lady seems really unhappy and unprofessional. American Express deserves better and it starts with HR and Management.
bad,When I worked here the management was appalling. Enjoyed the job as a whole but certain things did not work well together.
bad,"At Amex you can't be yourself, you have to be as they want you to be, fake. You are not allowed to care about people customers or colleagues, you have to care about the profit of the company and always put fist GOD MONEY. If you start working at Amex and you are a genuine caring person, you have to change to progress. If you want to became a manager you have to make sure you don't care for people, they can dismiss anyone anytime with stupid excuses just to make sure the profit of the company is positive at  the end of the  financial year, one I had issue to sign a contract to rent a flat as the landlord didn't trust the fact that I was working for Amex, as it's known as a company who don't care for people and they can leave you without a job in zero time."
bad,"Cleaning isn't  up to par, hr has to put in work order to get things such as toilet paper, paper towels or even soap to wash your hands half the time it's out and so is the hand sanitizer. It's full of dog hair dust, bed bugs and coackroaches. Not one manager is on the same page so you have a bunch of people running around barking orders with no clue what there doing they'll  scream about a dress code but yet the head of the floor will walk around with his pants hang below his but. All around filthy place."
bad,"Disappointed...manager does not know what she is doing and  very intimidated by storng people.."
bad,"You are just a number with this large company.  At the end of the day, the company makes decisions without consulting those that will be involved with dealing with the changes."
bad,"When i reported an incident of harassment in good faith to the forum that says that they will address all instances of injustice, i got fired with no adequate time to find a suitable role as the leader was too strong and had played an excellent game plan to save herself and fire me."
bad,"Iv'e been in the bank industry for a while now. This is the worst bank I have ever worked for. You are promised a great career with great opportunities to move up. After joining, you are in a training class for a few weeks of propaganda about how great of a company this is. Once you start working, you are treated like a slave. No matter how well you perform, your stats are never good enough. Managers don't care about you. Nobody cares about you. You are treated like an animal. People get fed up, they quit after a couple months and amex hires new ones to replace them and the cycle repeats. I must give them this, I have never seen an enterprise so efficient at recycling people."
bad,Heavy Call center environment you feel like you are a phone slave everyone was unhappy it is a depressing job very demanding no reward pay is low and staying there is a big error
bad,They actively discourage any interest in the company and are unresponsive to passionate and talented managers. There were days when my Director would never have an update or task related communication.
bad,"Was absolutely tricked into thinking this was a great company to work for.  Reality is perception, and my perception of American Express is unhappiness.  They don't care about you."
bad,"Just like previous Travel Consultants comments, I thought this was my dream job working for a major credit company with FREE traveling benefits to most beautiful countries and staying at the most expensive hotels on the company's Dime. NOPE! Managers were ghetto and most of the time either high or drunk or both. They threatened to fire you every day if your numbers weren't right, The commute, the pay, the everything was horrible about this company. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!"
bad,Sehr unkollegiale Mitarbeiter. Der größte Fehler meines Lebens.
bad,Provided Customer Services for new American Express Card Holders. Received 100 to 150 calls per day. Activated New Cards and explained Benefits of various American Express Cards.
bad,dittà con cui non vale la pena lavorare anchese il lavoro è abbastanza buono
bad,"Awful Company, Stressful and very Prejudice Company, poor Culture, Long Hours, Poor Management, Nothing tasteful at all. Would NOT Recommend at all. Poor benefits"
bad,I left this company several years ago and ran into a former office mate last week.   She said things have not changed and no one trusts anyone else in that company; it is everyone for themselves.  Management is only looking at how much money they can put in their pocket and it does not matter who they step on to get that.
bad,Awful awful awful - AMEX actually not so bad but them being run by/through APAC was the root cause of most of their issues.  Run don't walk from this place.
bad,"American Express Travel Services closed permanently. Makes no sense to rate when they have closed down. Was a good place but closed now, no more locations"
bad,No. Wouldn't go back under any circumstances. Work conditions were horrific. Leadership at every level was horrific. Work/life balance was horrific. Just NO at every level.
bad,No one cares about a third party call center. The pay is peanuts. The promise of a bonus is a lie because the only way you get a bonus is by meeting certain criteria which they change whenever they feel like to avoid you attaining a bonus.
bad,did not enjoy working for this company. management was horrible and they had no control over staff. staff was rude and not professional at all. did not pay enough to deal with those conditions.
bad,"set salary limits on advancement, no matter what kind of advancement. They have career advisement but your advancement will never meet industry standards because there is a cap on pay increase."
bad,"This place has no history, no future, and not a very good place to work.  They treat you like a dog, get all your clients, then fire you for no reason."
bad,"Very stressful. Management very critical of small issues. Best part of the job was feeling happy upon satisfaction of being able to help customers."
bad,"They don't care for their employees, you are only a number to them you are not an employee. They took away all bonuses and all aspects of them showing they cared about us being valued. If anyone said anything to anyone about the negative treatment or changes they were laid-off or forced to retire. They also allow harassment be it on disability or harassment. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."
bad,"Horrible place to work for, your in a airport trying to have passengers who are probably already tired in line or just woke up to take their flight, sign up for a credit card that's just for flying. It is severely inconvenient and quite a hassle. The kiosk was by all the chairs which can get very crowded and uncomfortable."
bad,"I interviewed for a position as a ""Business Consultant"" and all the training was around that title.  When I got to the floor, we were just trying to slam people into credit cards and even going through personal accounts to try and sell the business accounts.  Unprofessional place lots of drinking and spending time playing games.  Office spaces are ancient and uncomfortable.  Management at all levels think they are all great but they basically have meetings and hand out cookies.  Unethical environment but the cafeteria was good"
bad,"This place is the corporate equivalent of a movie Gillian.  Managment will never back you up if they screw up.  The only people who do well here are royal jerks or develop a drinking problem.  Talk with someone who works here.  They will say ""the benefits are great."" Ask them how they like their job and they develop lock jaw.  If you want to TRULY feel what it's like to be a peon for an evil overlord, then amex is the place for you."
bad,"Awful management "
bad,"I was excited about working at Amex Travel but that excitement soon turned to gloom and stress headaches. In our training class, we had a few people who quit due to the way we were treated. The Office leader would yell at us daily. The trainers would call out employee mistakes in front of groups, which was very embarrassing; there were employees who would cry. Once we got on the phones, cardmembers were allowed to call us idiots and curse us out. If you hang up on a card member, you could be fired. We were told daily that we would be fired if we didn't receive good surveys from cardmembers."
bad,"Everything a call center shouldn't be. Nit picking every move you made, micro managing everything you do. No trust or working relationships. Environment was terrible."
bad,"Used to be a great place to work for many years, long tenured employees, not the case in the last 5 years due to reorg and layoffs, reduction in pay, not what you know but who you know forcing you to  wear your keflar vest to work unfortunately.  Very sad."
bad,I didn't enjoy it.  Other people might.  Your main goal is to kiss butt to premium card holders.  But you have to do so while continually saying no because there is so little you can do to actually help them--the company has a lot of restrictions.  Almost no one stays here long.
bad,"The pay was acceptable but the working conditions, poor company support and no benefits nor any type of viable time off made for a very poor experience"
bad,"They have downsized the collections department so you cant make money, if you want to make money they will look for ways to fire you. The top people get threathened."
bad,Great learning experience. Top management is good. No work life balance. Job security is there. Extreme work pressure which is the Hardest part that most employees find it difficult to cope up with.
bad,"I love to worker at that area  because is so big company, I always do a lot of worker when am at work and answered the phone at the security office, enjoy worker with my Co-worker"
bad,absolutely the worse place to work. everything is numbers driven to the tee. please stay away from this country. not the place to grow nor move up. leave it be.
bad,Working in American express is not as soothing. As the treatment for employee is not so respectful. Work  for long hours is fine sometime but Management threaten employee to work.
bad,Responsible to properly represent buyer and seller to disclose their rights.To do the CMA regular basis to satisfied the clients.Guide the clients according to their needs.
bad,"this place sucks to work , no culture , so many indians that you'd rather not work. feels like your at a indian market speaking their language all day long, to an extent where the requirements was also in their regional language. lol"
bad,I did not like this company they totally treated there employees as totally expendable there were no benefits and the management was horrible. the hours were horrible to.
bad,Literally nothing.                                                                                                          I literally wouldn't recommend this place.
bad,"I love working for this company. This company is really great and has great benefits and enjoy all the things this company.. 401K,HEALTH,DENTAL AND VISION"
bad,"Organization is never interested in investing on technology."
bad,AMEX is always ahead in the technology stack. It's environment is challenging. People need to work long hrs. Can't take much off.
bad,9:30AM -11:00PM is typical day. on weekends it is just 9:30AM - 8:00PM.  TL calls you every one hour. you get to learn all the bad words available in history of man kind.
bad,"I do not recommend this place for a first job. No training, bad leadership and did not learn anything good. Work life balance is unbearably horrible."
bad,"Your request will not be made.  If you want that kind of information in writing, you'd better look elsewhere.  This is putting job applicants in a precarious position.  What you are asking is totally uncalled for and really should be reported to North Carolina as unfair business practices. "
bad,"Demarchage pousse et vulgaire pour l'appat du gain, image deja degradante a portee mais surtout les cartes vendues sous un numero vendeur personnel sont volees a l'arrivee a paris par des personnes peu scrupuleuses"
bad,"Befor it was Ameriprize, AMEX would hire anyone but you had to pay for your own licenses.  worked 12-14 hour days and saturdays.  100% commission... 99% attrition."
bad,"These guys are cheats! Extremely employee unfriendly. They churn out profit by deducting employee salary, bonuses and pay the least in market"
bad,"I would come in and answer calls all day long and book travel.  It was not a personable job, and I did not like that we could not work on building relationships with clients."
bad,"The upper management is terrible. No one ever seems to know what's going on and they lie. The company will send emails about these wonderful incentives to make their workers work extra hard to receive and they do not follow through when the goal is accomplished. There is no balance between work and home. If a day off is needed well forget it. No in house staffing all staffing requests are done in some foreign country. Pay is terrible. We get screamed at on a daily basis from card members about things that are not in our control and smile. Give some sort of empathy statement and move on to the next one. Definitely do not get paid enough. Raises are a joke. After a year of employment I received a 5¢ raise. Company does not care about it's employees or customers."
bad,Handle irate callers who request to speak to supervisor... Monitor calls via the Avaya recording system and provide feedback to representative daily... Dealing with different personalities.
bad,could know much about the company. due to financial reason left the company in 2 months
bad,"NO longer in business, no quaily of work and poor employee, no benfits, no pay, slow company"
bad,"Travel research assistant ."
bad,"Management allow the Leads to be rude and disrespectful to the agents. Favoritism is show to people of their own decent, also with them moving back to the USA they clearly do not care about work life balance. I have worked 16hrs straight without even a thank you. If you are looking for a safe place to work do not go here."
bad,Travel Counselor ....great jobs if you could meet the sales quota each month. Every month it was raise higher and higher . I was amazed how many days off per you get at the start ...very good.
bad,I went from data entry to computer operations great steps to a higher level
bad,"American Express is a productive and fun workplace with a lot of incentives, I learned to listen and then resolve issues to my best abilities, had a lot of fun and helpful coworkers, they also cater to employee with children had a on site daycare facility where employee can use as backup day care instead of having to miss days of work"
bad,they were not a people place the didnt care about family we were just a number
bad,"- aucun statut légal"
bad,"I would have rather worked at McDonalds. I couldnt believe how that company allows that third party to represent the American Express brand.  Everyone in that building has been in there position for a year or less.  The lack of structure , flexibility, and communication were the reasons for my leaving.  The operations manager is rude, and has absolutely NO idea of what hes doing, neither do the team leaders, that place needs a revamp of employees.  Or just get shut down by AMEX.  Its Convergys in Omaha, NE."
bad,Excellent client to work with.  Expanding to become a 2 billion dollar company in the next 2 years.  Good employee care and perks available for employees.
bad,Each day was a learning experience with old things emerging in a new way. It helped to increase my acumen immensely and hone my skills. Exposure in various departments has helped me to move closer to my goals.
bad,"call, call, call. try to sell people stuff that they do not need..  did not learn much except how to dial the phone"
bad,Horrible work experience. I hated going to work. Bad ecomony equals even worst work environment!!!!!
bad,"managers were very disorganized, very slow computer technology, high unachievable goals set out by managers"
bad,"A typical day at this place is fustrating. I learned about the travel industry. Management is the worst, i would rather work in a sweat shop. I loved my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was having to wake up to go to work. The most enjoyable part of the job was clocking out."
bad,"Worked for this company for 7 years - they hire people with no experience, pay them nothing and expect them to thrive. Training is limited - benefits are the worse....Management is a joke they use threats and bullying as management style - worse place to work in the valley - agents were constantly out on FMLA from the stress."
bad,"I would not recommend working in the Hartford, CT office to anyone! The employees in this office are one big clique and they will let you know how unwelcome and unwanted you are! The management is unintelligent and unprofessional and run the whole clique. They are horrible at training and huge on expectations. It is without a doubt the most uncomfortable workplace i have ever entered."
bad,The owner and operations manager are in a relationship and makes turmoil for all employees.
bad,"Enjoyed clients as well as, coworkers. I learned to work under tremendous last-minute pressure to points on the globe reporters must report to now."
bad,Regional vice president had the worst moral compass I have ever seen. The office has since closed.
bad,I worked for these people for 2 years customer service is a joke its only about call times how many calls you can takenot how many people you help
bad,this company was the defendant in a class action suit brought by female financial advisors
bad,"Ambiente rilassato e a tratti nevrotico."
bad,Stressful job environment  and management is rude you're cussed at all the time and talked down to.  Training is good but management is not good towards staff
bad,"After training and on the production floor. You are not properly trained. You are in fear everyday. American Express takes most of our commission checks (bonus) we were paid just over minimum wage. People were getting  fired all the time. There is no job security. People would have panic attacks that when they got to work they would be fired. If you didn’t excellent surveys they would take 75%. As Very goods are fails. 18% was taken from every paycheck for recovery fees and direct deposits. Just before bonus was to be paid. They would have a huge firing so they didn’t have to give you, your hard earned commission. Never work for this company.. let alone have an American Express card. Knowing how they treat their employees. BEWARE of working for this company. Major illegal theft."
bad,"While American Express has great benefits for full time employees, you have to start as a contractor. Multiple departments don’t hire contractors, and when they do, they consistently hire underqualified men over women despite the women having better work product and numbers. It is below market pay for the job, but they do train you on everything. If you are desperate, it can be a great jumpstart, but prepare yourself to find something else as soon as you can."
bad,In my Opinion the Culture at AMEX is immoral.  Training is unrealistic.Goals are unrealistic  Favorites are chosen and if you do not fall into that group you are out.  The training staff spends more time socializing than training.
bad,"While working at American Express I was constantly worried that I was going to be fired, until I ultimately was. The metrics they expect you to receive for their survey scores are unrealistic, which they know, but they don't care."
bad,"ive worked in amex in 3 departments for 8 years, the team leaders were very rude and the workload doesnt match the pay and low increments. rude that some restrict staff going to the toilet!!!!"
bad,"Poor work/life balance, large gaps between business and IT. Non Indians have very little chance to grow up in the IT as almost all Indian leaders promote their people and get away with it."
bad,Will not work there again. It is a stressful job with management on top of you at all times. There is no place for advancement. The pay and benefits are descent.
bad,Gave me 16 hours of training when I should of had a 120 hour class. Force me to do a job I javent been properly trained for then want to hold me accountable for mistakes that I make.
bad,"I would avoid this company like the plague.  You are micro-managed to death!  You are never praised, only criticized. I graduated top in my training class but was still criticized on a daily basis for not saying all of the scripted information on every call. Which was hard to do with the customers constantly yelling and rushing you.  They monitor your every move. Every call is recorded. And when their tools stop working and you have to call tech support, you are written up. You can miss 2 days a year. After that you are terminated. I worked there 3 years and never got a weekend day off. And I had to work til midnight. We had to bid for our shifts, but managers and team leaders always got the good schedules before it is even your turn to bid. I never had health issues til this job. Now I have high blood pressure. Do yourself a favor and get a job anywhere else!"
bad,I am shocked AMEX is still in business with how poorly they are running a s a company. No one seems happy and they seem to import more temps than needed. It was a mess and I would never recommend anyone working there.
bad,customer service retention rep took calls from card holders regarding cancellation of cards dialy calls customer service rep retention rep call center advocate
bad,"Une société externe s'occupe de la vente pour américan express donc quand j'ai postulé je me suis retrouvé chez FDV ( force de vente ) petite antenne de Nice qui s'ocupe de promouvoir le produit pour american express."
bad,"This is the worst place I have ever worked at. The company has changed drastically especially over the last year. Recently they have become more sales driven. They don't care about you and if your customer satisfaction is through the roof. You are still REQUIRED to sell or you will get written up for not doing so. You don't have any opportunity to move up in the company unless you know people in high places. The leaders make up lies to cover up for upper management or else THEY get into trouble. The health benefits are AWFUL! I have had to pay almost 5k out of pocket within a three month period because there seems to be certain ""exceptions"". The ONLY good thing is that they offer 184 vacation hours a year and you have the ability of purchasing up to 40 more."
bad,"NOT the most pleasant work experience"
bad,"Had to work cause I needed a job there. Ruthless managers, had to communicate with, and very very disrespectful."
bad,los jefes jamas te ayudan solo piden ingresos y te obligan a trabajar los 365 dias del año cancun es una plaza espantosa gracias al mal liderazgo
bad,"Very biased outdated company"
bad,"L'azienda è apparantemente di successo. Il processo di selezione è confuso, poco professionale, gestito da figure che non hanno skill adatte, nè idea sul ruolo da ricoprire."
bad,Training is very poor quality.  Management and culture has a lot to be desired.  Benefits are not as good as other companies.  It's a job not a career.
bad,Terrible company to work for. The management is not concerned with training a new hire. I had the worst experience being employed for this company and will not recommend it to anyone. But this is my personal opinion and is team specific.
bad,"They claim to be collaborative in the FIU but if you discuss a case or ask for clarity they tell you’re wrong with no further explanation. Please stay away they treat their contractors like trash and full time"
bad,Highly stressful. Management not helpful and won't help you if you are not being treated fairly. Highly Driven Sales environment. You cant take your sick time more than three times on the same day within 60 days. I did like working from home.
bad,"In the travel and lifestyle department you lose all private life the miment you finish training. With over 60 shift patterns you need to rate them from 1 to 64 (desired to not desired) and hope for the best. Usually you get the least desired or the middle ones but never the desired because those are saved for the favourite ones. "
bad,"They have a culture of blaming others for their short sightedness. Lots of meetings. They spend their time patting each other on their backs. They know who is to blame, but rather blame others."
bad,i don't really have anything to say it could be a good job but it didn't work out that way because of the constant need to change and change and change and change.
bad,OK if you have a good manager. However churn at leadership levels is constant. So don't expect to have the same manager for more than a few months. I was a director and had 6 VP's in 27 months! All driven by politics! I worked for them for 16 years and was downsized 3 times.
bad,American Express TRS was a very negative place to work with horrible management .  Management was retaliatory in nature .  The tools did not work well the the software I had to work with and I received no support from management .
bad,"Quand je suis arrivée, j'ai eu une formation avec d'autres personnes venant également de signer en CDI, et nous avons été étonnés de voir qu'il n'y avait aucune place de libre là où nous étions supposés aller par la suite... En fait le turn-over et surtout les ruptures de contrats sont très fréquentes (mais ça il ne faut pas en parler). Même lorsque quelqu'un est viré c'est fait de manière rapide et à l'abris des regards!"
bad,"Je krijgt minder dan het minimumloon. rond de 7-8 euro per uur bij de klantenservice!  Schandalig, dit is voor de meeste mensen hier in nederland een lachertje. Je kan nog beter voor dit geld in een winkel werken, waar je niet misbruikt worden zoals bij american express voor de opdrachten die je moet doen, zou je hier minimaal 12.50 euro per uur moeten verdienen"
bad,will not work here not a good place for minorites or people of color only people from india because they have a separate building  where they can be separated from the whites
bad,"I really hate this job. Too many calls and most of them are angry travel agents calling to complain. Also, micromanagers are their specialty. Since team managers have nothing else to do they will call you to check on calls and to give training on something either they never done themselves or did maybe for a short period of time."
bad,"Management is awful. If your face doesn't fit forget it."
bad,"If you work in customer service,  prepare to take phone calls back to back for your entire shift. It's a highly stressful environment. They constantly change pay structure which messes with your payouts meaning if you aren't in the very top percent of your tier, you only get a small percentage of your sales. Management is nowhere to be found when needed and are not helpful. Any time for training or one on ones with management are constantly canceled because of the call volume which hinders employees from growing or learning the product. This directly affects your surveys from cardmembers which directly affects your paycheck. Shift bids are few and far between and management plays favorites.  Any second shift or weekend workers have no access to the amenities on campus such as the cafeteria or Starbucks as both close early. I can't say enough negative things about working for this horribly mismanaged company who makes terrible decisions and your direct leaders don't know anything about the product. Easily the worst job I've ever had."
bad,"worst travel job i have ever had "
bad,The company pays good but unfortunately the company is dishonest and lacks integrity. I am very disappointed in the dishonesty and lack of integrity. They claim to reimburse you for your travel expenses and never would. Then they play games and are dishonest. It was very disappointing. I could go on and on. They don't allow breaks or lunches.
bad,"The manager did not allow contractors to take breaks without clocking out, this included using the restroom. I asked about this and they let me go for no reason."
bad,"I was treated the worst I have ever been treated by any company working here. They treat you like you are a resource, and not a human being by using you to hit their goals and numbers and not giving you the recognition you deserve for doing so--then adding insult to injury by throwing you away like a wet piece of toliet paper after you met all of their goals."
bad,"Very little professional independence. Managers did not respect the legal responsibilities of my professional designation. Overall, a very stressful workplace with very little reward."
bad,"Amex is a highly brand conscious company and they expect people to walk and talk a certain way. If you are a little different you won't be promoted. Race matters a lot. Very political, hierarchical and immediate leaders can destroy your career. Everyone is aware of your employee band level. You are openly addressed based on your band level which is ridiculous. "
bad,"Bajo sus lideres buscaban no hacer equipos de trabajo"
bad,"I was hired as a contract-to-hire, so right out of the gate, I had to perform in order to ensure my position. I was prepared to work extra hours, and go above and beyond to ensure my position; however, this was the norm. Hours were typically 9am to 7pm. This was strange for me because I am used to hours starting earlier. Our team was spread over different timezones, so I came in early enough to work effectively across timezones. I produced numerous advancements in our product; however, I my efforts were continually diminished by my manager. It was nearing the point where I was about to approach HR about it. His reasons were unfounded with absolutely no reason. Many times his reasons were, ""I'm the manager and I can do/say what I want."" The project manager and development manager were never on the same page. This caused priorities to shift often. The ""business"" group pretty much governs the direction technology goes in. My manager would make ""knee jerk"" decisions based on the sentiment of the business group. I got the feeling that this mysterious group was pretty much the deciding factor on success or failure at this company. Besides impacting the direction of people's careers, it also dictated technological advancements within the company. Often times, over more effective and efficient software development practices, lesser choices were made. This lead to much of the technologies within Amex to be antiquated at best. Also, I worked closely with RFCs as part of the change management process. RFCs are required for each change and can take hours/days to complete. For something"
bad,The most enjoyable part of my job was working with respectable people
bad,Did not train on up coming products and services. New policies and procedures were implemented without prior knowledge of the changes. Very unprofessional atmoshpere. Made promises and did not deliver.
bad,micromanaged favortism to reps that do unethical sales management is unfair to hard working employees.  The culture at american express is antequated and ran by upper management that is stale and old ways of thinking
bad,"I loved the job! The job itself has challenges of course but is fantastic on the other hand, the chance to be really proud of a booking or speak with a wonderful customer. There is one rule for staff and another standard for managers, that leave a bad atmosphere. It's entirely about who likes you. You can have fantastic sales or targets etc but if your direct manager doesn't like you, you'll be very aware of it. It never feels like you are good enough, as there is always a problem from someone."
bad,Difficult place to work with very little work life balance. Management interested in 'what did you do or me today'. God forbid you make it past 50 without being 'released'.
bad,Hostile Work Environment. Not a good place to work. People try to ruin your career to protect their poor performance. Very hard to get hired on after doing contract work.
bad,"Worked OSU for three years then transferred to cruise department. Overnight you would get calls from all over the world, ie. I missed my flight, I need a hotel room now, or drunks calling in to get a limousine home. And in between all this nonsense you had to make a sales quota. Spanish was the main language on the floor and I only do English so I always felt out of the loop. Benefits dwindled and layoffs were going on in 2008. Travel benefits slowly were watered down. Then you needed to track your orders as stealing them was commonplace. Cruise department was worse, higher value sales were stolen. Support staff was questionable at best. Constantly in fear of losing my job. The absolute worst job of my career setting me back years. Got some fams and discounts on trips I had to pay for? Did call center work at Verizon, not bad, but this place was miserable. Chewed me up and discarded me like trash. Thanks tbos. For your heart felt help on that charge back."
bad,Horrible place to work!  Management is very disorganized and unable to provide guidance and leadership.  Management is very cliquey and  very unprofessional environment.
bad,"They claim that they are one of the best companies for working females, but its a big lie. If you complain then they threaten you either for visa sponsorship actions. Poor management and just bureaucracy. Some male managers are very bad and gang up harrassing employees."
bad,This was a job that required you work long stressful hours with no support from management and also they expect you to be a punching bag to cardholders .
bad,"There is nothing positive to say about Amex and the way it treats its employees. Nothing. You can not control your schedule, or the length of your shifts, or stop to note accounts (you need to take calls from start until finish.) They will promise you bonuses but you will never get them because they find 1 million and 1 reasons to write you up. They do not want to keep employees in the long run because they do not want to give anyone raises or their bonuses that they were promised."
bad,Everyday there were new policies to make the position more difficult and laborious.  The fact that there are no positions to advance to just compounded the stress levels.
bad,"A typical day at work includes a lot of unproductive meetings and collaboration sessions, slow decision making and repetitive deck writing. people leadership is hardest part of the job, without senior leader support"
bad,Initially reeled in with lots of promised with non coming to fruition. Manager who would constantly snap at the team despite claiming we could always ask questions. Severe lack of support and empathy and lots of people being made redundant despite the business claiming it is growing. A lot of staff has been there for less than a year which says a lot about the company.
bad,No empowerment as leader. The entire department revolves around a single person's decisions. Eventually team dissatisfaction rises.
bad,"What I've learn at Amex, is how to work as a team. Enjoy working with people. the hardest part in that job, is when you have do telemarketting specially when call at the wrong time. I enjoyed working there, I love to help people. Amex is the nice place for people like me to work."
bad,"There is a sincere problem with american express treating it's employees, they sometimes treat you  as corporrate slaves. Their bonus structure is out there to get you, so you don't earn your bonus. And they are always randomly changing things, Most of this can be lost, if a card member gives a survey about you, no mattter how hard you try to save a bad mood card member, you will get a poor call which in turn would make you lose your bonus. Still does not sound convincing? Card members are asked two questions, one about the company and one about the agent they are working for. If the member is not in a good mood, he will rate american express poorly, and excellent for agent it would still effect the agent as poor, and would look poor in monthly evaluation. Amex  takes away your bonus to reduce the damage of the card member's views about the company,  if the card member considers amex to be poor, Amex doesn't say thank you for trying to save a card member but instead considers the employee poor in dealing with cm. At some times, it is American express's fault for not having leeway in dealing with some customers. Upper management can sometimes change situation with card members, but it rarely happens, so ones who are automatically affected are amex's agents. They tell frontline workers, to treat customers in a humanely way, but fail to reach that objective with their employees. This is current standard of american express today. They make changes, and they should aim to create a standard quality for their frontline workers."
bad,The telecommuting is good but the financial compensation and growth opportunities are not very good. Not a fan of the increasing micromanagement either. Also the organization fails to invest in the internal technology that would enable the front line employees to do their job easier. The health insurance yearly deductible is also a joke so don't rely on them for assistance.
bad,"I was so excited to become a part of the team at American Express I worked hard was never my productivity was above average. However , when my supervisor found out I was in a domestic abusive relationship she tricked me into believing american express was supportive advised to take a week of to get into a domestic abuse shelter assured me I would have my job when I returned. The truth was I was terminated that day because of my abusive relationship and everything was done in secret."
bad,"you have to drink the kool aid all day long they hire nice people but you will be a pure slave to the company"
bad,"Stressful, difficult, abusive clientele, high expectations"
bad,"The tools we are given to preform our duties are always not working so we have to constantly have to rebook, and tell our caller we are sorry our computers are slow."
bad,"This is not a travel position, it is a call center position you must take a call every 6-9 minutes or explain to a Manager what you are working on.  Many agents work in a virtual environment and have little travel knowledge or destination knowledge.  There is no opportunity for growth, constant change in procedures.  Attrition is very high at the agent and Team Leader so there is a lack of teamwork as well."
bad,"AmEx pays fairly well, but management will treat you like an easily replaceable automaton. There is a weak attempt at fostering a fun culture, which is overshadowed by the secretive management and poor treatment. For me, this treatment was not worth the bump in pay."
bad,"On paper, the company is great. Once there, you are a slave to the ridiculous and extremely regimentend work schedules. The turnover was high when I worked there."
bad,You are on your own as an Engineering Director.  This is fine until your partner complains to your leader.  Instead of understanding the problem you have been communicating and assisting in push back of unreasonable delivery dates - you get belittled and forced to work 24 hour shifts until delivery met.  Agile method out and expect extreme programming with very little testing to promote software.  Expect a new VP (your leader) every 4-6 months.
bad,An issue with favoritism with management. Skin color became a big issue because I am a white person with a brain injury. I was treated unfairly. I feel that the a person with a mental disability was treated illegally and unfair.
bad,Very political. I don't believe the culture of the company fosters a healthy environment. In my opinion there is also a huge lack of integrity within the management team going all the way to the top.
bad,"Outsourcing Middle Management is a bad Idea. "
bad,"i would not advise  this job to anyone, its very unstable and although the pay is great the job security is non existent . You'll get laid off quite often."
bad,"I had a choice of really difficult shifts, either 7 to 3 or 1.30 to 9.30 and I opted for the later shift."
bad,"This is a horrible place to work, management was constantly getting fired, immense pressure to collect, compliance and regulatory changes... Manager's are only concerned about themselves and their commissions ... Employees are cut throat and eager to cut u 2 the bone to get their commission check raised.  High turnover in the GCA area, layoffs and job security does not exist.  "
bad,"We had to work overtime and middle management to be is very homophobic. It was not a good place to work after a bit. They hire first level managers with NO TRAVEL Background and then they have a click. If they don't like YOU, YOU are gone even if you do get 14 letters of commendation from clients. I would NOT recommend anyone working here at all."
bad,"I am a Native Sabre Corporate Travel Consultant.. "
bad,"If your a robot this job works for you,this was the hardest job I ever had in my life"
bad,The company's revolving doors policy. You are not valued at all. They are sending all the jobs to India.
bad,12hour work days M-F and 4 hour work day on Saturdays. A majority of the time was spent in a room cold calling people who requested information. You had to read from a script to respond and it was very unnatural.
bad,"The Home Based Services Team Leaders are a prime example of the BLIND LEADING THE BLIND. There was absolutely NO TRUST for the people at home, always treated like toddlers on the loose. The technical issues were unbearable with the refurbished systems provided to perform TOP NOTCH work. Everyone blamed everyone and no one held themselves accountable for answers. The pay was mediocre compared to the level of excellence that we were held to. Whatever you do, if you happen to have NO PLACE BETTER TO WORK AND NEED A JOB make sure you cover yourself and keep great documentation on all conversations and incidents."
bad,"A typical day involved update meetings with VPs, Directors and others who had no clue what it takes to close large strategic partnership transactions. My direct manager was the biggest roadblock of all. She had no understanding of the actual work or the ability to adjust the metrics to account for high level business development partnerships. The structure was so messed up that co-workers weren't even incentivized to help close these commercial lending deals. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with my boss on a daily / weekly basis. I did take advantage of working from home which was much more productive than being in the office. The office environment was toxic."
bad,"The total sweatshop job don’t do it regardless of what they tell you as a recruiter speaks she’s probably lying"
bad,"Working there is beyond stressful, their “in depth” training, really doesn’t prepare you for the things you encounter on the phones. Management is it’s own problem."
bad,"Worst job experience EVER. Poor management,  accused of wrong doing before getting the facts, once truth was known there was no apology. HR helps facilitate poor culture with take it or leave it attitude. Was actually told ""We are American Express. We can do what we want because we have a line of people waiting to work here"". Training staff is pushy once you get on the phones"
bad,Being a call center representative they don't allow anything with paper which is understandable for dealing with customers and their card information. Although it's down right disgusting because they NEVER clean the keyboards and never vacuum either. We share the computer stations and people will leave just anything. You can't even get a sanitizer wipe to clear it off. It's disgusting and a degrading area to work in. I'm surprised I haven't come across any pest but I guess it's too filthy for them as well.
bad,Very stressful and not because of the customers. Management plays favorites and if you question.. watch out... you are a trouble maker. Always fearful of layoffs due to outsourcing and shipping jobs overseas. very political..and not paid enough for amount of responsibility demanded
bad,"I worked as a Travel Counselor for American Express in their Salt Lake City location. I serviced platinum and centurion card holders. I was a full travel agent and booked flights, hotels and cars."
bad,American Express pays well but don't expect to retire there. They open and shut departments every quarter and if you don't continue to move around than you will eventually become a part of the great number of great workers that have lost there jobs.
bad,I worked for American Express for 26 years.  I was an Administrative Assistant supporting over 150 employees.
bad,Company does not value older seasoned employees. 5400 have started being laid off this year. Many more local jobs going to India that are NOT coming back to the USA.
bad,"Please don't even apply for the AT Home position. I left my job of 5 years for this job, and I still regret it. This company lies to its employees constantly, they dont give you all the information about the position. But in training after you have sent in your two weeks notice to your employer for American Express they tell you ""Oh yeah by the way you need to finish these 10 transactions the customer ask of you in 3 minutes."" Really if you had told me that I wouldn't have resigned from my job . I asked the interviewer numerous times why was I in training for 3 months she said ""Oh just so we can make sure you know the product."" They have all these rules on how they can fire you. Call avoidance, Taking too long on a call, System Issues, Transferring, being in auxillary mode and Surveys. Let me just talk about surveys for a second. They will hold you accountable even if it's something that is totally unreasonable and out of even their own company policy and the customer complains in a survey about it. This company is run by a bunch of idiots.Then they have micro managers on the phone that will hold you accountable for what the past rep did to the customer and when you try to fix it for them, management tells you , you were on the phone too long. We asked our trainer what the success rate was for graduating training we were lied to and told he only got rid of 1 person all the time he has been training . While I was in training 3 people were fired just in my training class.They also put a Webcam in your house during training .STAY AWAY!"
bad,"Amex is what it is, a conglomerate with a Great CEO, whose message gets lost as it trickles down into leadership.  Many poor leaders at Amex as individual contributors are promoted without training or development far to often."
bad,I was security. I was able to keep people from harm and showed that inappropriate behavior was unacceptable.
bad,"Incredibly high pressure, and demanding targets. Very stressful atmosphere with little to no support. It is a great opportunity if you are prepared for this, if not, stay away."
bad,I worked from home and my direct manager also worked from home. They lived in another country in a different time zone. The first month of my working there I had no contact with my manager at all. However the first time I was in contact it was to tell me everything I was doing wrong. This is understandable as a new hire however it would have been nice for some coaching and not straight your doing this wrong. I basically had to figure it out on my own after training. Also if you try to transfer to other departments they will hang up on you because they are worried about their call handling. They will hang up on you while you have the customer on the line with you. Then you have to wait to transfer them again which messes up your numbers which in the end hurts your pay out on your checks. I hated working for this place so much. I ended up needing surgery and had complications so I had to stop working for a period of time so I left the company due to that.
bad,Made lots and lots of money however this is a very unprofessional work environment but who cares when your commission is uncapped unlimited overtime I made lots of money
bad,"micro manage, you were not able to have a conversation with customer, only allowed to read a strict script, only able to take a 30 min lunch break"
bad,"pay is great and if you like to be called out your name, cursed at and always degraded by customers then this is the job for you! also management will never defend you and take up for you when its your self respect on the line vs a customer and their great payment history or a centurion card holder. you mean nothing to them when money is involved! worse company i have ever worked for and only a push over would enjoy working for amex!"
bad,Rather not say at the moment. Things are definitely unfair.Metrics need to be reevaluated. There have been people terminated for things they couldn't control and the card members have no clue that this is causing employees to lose their jobs.
bad,I got let go because of a missed tkt but there was no missed tkt the tool was not working write. And the I I got walked out because I ask wrong question.
bad,"Au recrutement on nous promet beaucoup de belles choses, un fix plus commissions et une évolution de carrière rapide. "
bad,"I learned a lot using the Microsoft office suite, extensively used excel and Word in the processes we worked daily. Also used Outlook, PowerPoint and SharePoint. "
bad,"The best thing about this job was the money.  On top of regular take home pay, we received commission bonuses.  Management was not the best and the job was not really secure."
bad,"This could be a great company to work for.  It's reasonably well paid for Brighton and very good hours."
bad,"They head hunted me away from Carlson Wagonlit Travel "
bad,"American Express was a great place when I first started, however now it's just a sinking ship when it comes to the call center part of. Out of your two breaks or lunch if you had to use the restroom it would look negatively against you."
bad,I was hired as a contractor. I think the middle management has mismatched planning and execution. They should be transparent about their plans to contractors too and their culture is worst for the contractors. Most of the teams believe that FTE are superior to the contractors and maintain the attitude all over the workplace. Contractors lives are very miserable.
bad,"Working for American Express was wonderful for my bank account but horrible for physical and emotional health."
bad,"In the future, please create more consistent, organized training plans and allow your new hires to grow, succeed and become confident in their abilities. I was not given much training nor direction for at least three months despite begging for tasks all the time, then I was blamed for not being confident in my abilities. Also, please treat everyone the same and acknowledge them when speaking. Just because someone is a minority woman, does not mean she cannot be a great engineer."
bad,"sous traitant d'american express : force de vente "
bad,"Management is very friendly, not to feel pressurized at work just enjoying the work, co-workers very supportive, feel great to work at any place."
bad,"Grazie al mio impiego ho acquisito molte conoscenze, perfezionato quelle che avevo precedentemente tecniche, devo ringraziare l azienda per essere la professionista di oggi"
bad,"It was a good place to work. "
bad,"efforts go wasted"
bad,An enjoyable part of the job was management of a dedicated client.
bad,"This was the best job I ever had, only because every one after has to be considered a great job."
bad,"Very negitive company to entry level person's, promotion are for friends and family of upper management mostly."
bad,Do not wor here longer than 10 yrs! You will hit your ceiling and not get any more raises!
bad,Perhaps the most rewarding position of my career thus far. Constanty asked to attend classes ro better improve our workday and please clients.
bad,I worked here for 1 year 1 mo I never got a write up or anything brought to my attention one day I got called into office and was let go due to something on my calls I never understood it
bad,"I learned the ins and outs of the jounalism profession as it realtes to having, expediant, accurate travel arrangments done often at a moments notice. Many changes also occur. I was put on the VIP desk and was Team Lead. Resposible for ARC Reporting each week to be sure it was in Phoenix on time. I ws offered this position beacause The L.A. Times was one of a conglomerate of newspapers called imes Mirroir around the country. I was hired as a National Floater called upon to fill-in when necessary."
bad,Horrible company to work. i've been in the same position from the beginning. no promotion. people who has less experience & who joined after me got promoted & got a good pay hike also
bad,"It may be for some people, but it was certainly not for me. Stressful, very rude customer that call in and cuss you out. The management was unorganized and unhelpful and you don;t really get any hands on training. You spend 3 weeks in a classroom and then get thrown on the phones."
bad,Amex needs a union in their call center very badly cause they do not care if you have 6 months to 20 years they will just let you go . Their is so much favoritism in their south florida travel office . If you do not speak spanish you are treated like a step-child . Many employees filed eeoc complaints
bad,I used to love my job until they thought the more numbers you produce the better. In fraud it is more about stopping it and connecting with the customer.
bad,"login to the phone, sign in to the computer and take calls."
bad,"Very clicky work conditions among the analyst, unprofessional and racist treatment of black males made this a terrible experience for me."
bad,"The travel department is in trouble. There is a manager who has no management skills and micromanages. Team Leaders are solely based on choosing ""yes men"" for the manager. No experience team leaders are chosen over highly qualified and experienced colleagues. "
bad,Team Leads are absolutely no help. They promise you all these great perks when your hired but you never get any of them. They base your work performance on your surveys but the surveys can be for the previous worker if the call was transferred so if they write a bad review it falls on you and the supervisors don't care. Unable to take time off and you are mandated to a desk at all times!
bad,Not  a great place to work with high micro management and bad expertise. If you have a suggestion they will not accept it or just pretend to not even heard it.
bad,"Basically, you will be working in a strict Call Center Environment.  Management is dealing with Staff remotely and there are no managers based in the Dubai Office. Workplace culture is very intense and staff are arguing or fighting on a weekly basis and the politics is a daily practice. the hardest part of the Job is handling more than 100 accounts and your workmate's accounts as well when they are on leave. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fam trips."
bad,Great company but more development and coaching of People Leaders is necessary to keep great employees. Demands of the job and low paying positions for non-manger employees should be the focus for a culture change within the organization.
bad,"Manager was clueless.  Only worried about his/her position."
bad,"PAYBACK has got a super proposition in the market today, but they cant execute the value proposition as the internal politics and bad culture does not allow any innovation or execute with support. As the system is legacy, change management is huge problem. Amex has been supportive enough but the fact of the matter is the leadership team does not work well with each other. The leadership team is more focussed on driving their own self agenda"
bad,Work like in Miramar was terrible . My work was usually very busy doing research for the agents. I was treated less by the agents and management . If you were not part of the miami culture then you were not welcomed in this office. The hardest part was dealing with the agents demands and how they treated and talked down to us as research assistants . The most enjoyable part of the job was time off and the hotel stays we got .Also it was nothing for them to fried a long employee with 15 or more years cause their sales went low . If they had a union this would never of happened. They need Communication Workers of America union to stand up for their employee's
bad,"I was never reviewed. Its like a sweat shop with cameras everywhere. They are only concerned about you getting the dollars in for the company. I had a small desk in a corner next to a door. You can never ever answer a personal call or text unless on break. This was hard with kids in school. "
bad,The management lacked professionalism.   My first day the manager told me personal information about another employee and stated her meds were not working.  She is still there.
bad,"this is not a good company, would not recommend. co workers were not much of assistance, if the boss did not like you you had no chance at the place no"
bad,"Always overworked, salary very low, they always let go of staff after they compete 4 years then rehire within a week. Management is poor. Not much of appreciation between staff and management."
bad,"It doesn't matter what your background is or if you have a degree, what matters is if management ""likes"" you if you can move up in the company or not. Don't get on your supervisors bad side or they will find a way to terminate you!!!! I seen it over and over again.  Leaders play favorites. The job itself is good but little consistency with leadership and procedures and you have little ability to really help customers. Most jobs are being outsourced to India and you never know if yours will be next!"
bad,"As it is starting of my career, i joined American Express. But then Slowly and gradually the Image of the company is going down and down as it has poor service and not presence at most of the place, So it damages our relation with client ans therefore i left this Job."
bad,"Stressful environment.  A typical day at work involves taking as many calls as you can in the shortest amount of time irregardless of whether you helped the card member or not.  This is a ""sweat shop"" environment that is micromanaged by team leaders who are actually puppets to upper management.  It's all about the money not about the card members. Co-workers are pleasant, however, many are afraid to complain because we are constantly reminded that this is an ""At Will"" company and you can get fired at the snap of a finger.  Hardest part of the job is trying to take care of the card member while stressing out about the length of the call. The most enjoyable part of this job is break time."
bad,"Not a good place to work, pay is minimal and worked to death.  Personnel are brought in from other cultures and treated better. I do not recommend that as a good and healthy place to work."
bad,"Just terrible once new management took over, no one cared about workers, as they took jobs and went over seas.  Watch out more jobs going to foreign countries soon."
bad,"Poor work life balance. Lot of micro management and politics. They treat contractors like anything. Good part is , theres always a new tool to learn. They always try to use new technologies."
bad,"The work is a little boring but not all that bad. It is a great place to get experience in the short term. "
bad,"Early years with Amex delightful and looked forward to working and seeing my co-workers.  The last five years of employment totally sucked as management wanted ""blood out of a turnip"".  More work for pay and benefits that could be much better for a Fortune 500 company."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend this company. The culture is very negative and adversarial. Management plays favorites and rewards those who do what they want to do things faster, even if it isn't a sound decision"
bad,Unrealistic expectations...Negative reinforcement. Disorganized. conficting info. Working tools do not work properly. Too much control. Would not recommend
bad,This position was very competitive and if you didn't meet required sales numbers they would immediately write you up and try to fire you. A typical day at work was showing up ten minutes prior to shift start and staring your computer without clocking in. then the minute that your shift was scheduled to have started you must be in queue. Then you sit there and try to sell products to incoming callers. It was not easy allows having a ton of pressure on you to make the sales on every single call.
bad,"Work hours varied constantly, very strict attendance policy, and many company layoffs happen. Low pay, and high cost of benefits."
bad,"It's just a call center like anywhere else, no matter how much they pay.  Expect to be treated like a little peon and to have them berate you for failure."
bad,"American Express was a great place to work. Each week we had meetings to improve performance and go over new changes. In 2011 management changed hands and the call center went down hill. No meetings, you where expected to just know the changes and to improve on your own. Computer issues abounded and after 1.5 years asking for a fix, I just lived with the errors. Amex has fired(some quit but most where fired) over 250 people since dec 2012. Can't get promoted unless your a buddy of the person doing the decision. I asked for help for over 2.5 years with handle time and got no real help and the only time they tried was when I was written up for high handle time. 6 min is all you have to help the customer and Amex added to job duties without increasing handle time."
bad,"created and trained customer treatment"
bad,"Benefits are okay, but they treat you like an indentured servant. After 23 years with them I was forced to make a decision, stay and lose my sanity or retire and lose everything else. I chose the latter."
bad,"Enrolling customers, paying for membership points, transfer points to hotels, rental cars, and certificates."
bad,"No work life balance, management had terrible leadership skills"
bad,HR is very focused on its diversity program for VP level positions.  High turn over of leaders and no real strategy for dealing with competition other than the same old course of action.
bad,"A typical day at travel is like your in **** but much worse. You sit next your team lead who is always on your back. Plus you have these other people who's job it is to look at your time all day.   If your seen off the phone for more than 3 min (even if you're trying to help a card member) your ""call avoiding"" and you can get written up for it.So many mixed messages that you don't know whether to help your client or please the phone times. Its a lot of work too, your dealing with doctors, lawyers, who don't take less service. and you'll hear from them too. So you have your leaders on your back plus clients constantly on your back.You eventually start trying to not help anybody because your too stressed about your call time. Once I got in trouble for using the bathroom three times in a day, and they added my time up the next day to be 9 MINUTES, and I got a verbal warning. They tell you to use the bathroom on your breaks. If you can avoid TRAVEL AT AMEX, DO IT. TRY TO GET INTO SOMETHING ELSE. THE WORST JOB IVE EVER HAD. and I've worked for great companies like APPLE. Now im into a better company paying more. Much happier life."
bad,"Working at American Express was difficult in USA and Argentina.  Do not know how to keep excellent employees and do not care."
bad,"Where to start, team leads were great, forced OT at one point, some nasty customers, and some not. New management treating the place like a dictatorship. Pay was good, benefits were meh. Always busy every day. Learned about flights hotels and car rentals. Hardest part was talking to those clients when there is nothing you can actually do to help, and they treat you like garbage. Most enjoyable was booking the vacations."
bad,Provided very limited support for a new accountant. Limited communication to learn new duties. Horrible long hours during time I was at the company. People not very friendly.
bad,"Syntel is a staffing company that did most of its buisness with American Express while I worked there. While they try their best, the company is a bit of a disorganized mess because the company's management is headquarted in India."
bad,"I had no experience in sales, and i was put into the sales department. I was given 0 training and expected to know how to do my job with zero experience and 0 training."
bad,"The executive management has no loyalty for workers. Spent 5 of the last 7 years contracted with ""promises"" of going permanent. But, it never happened."
bad,Looking to lay off a billion dollars in salary's over the next year.  I would stay away if you are looking for longevity and a work life balance in your career.
bad,"As a company, American Express was adequate. However the management with Alorica, the extension site, was unprofessional and  did not provide the training employees with the necessary tools to perform the job adequately to the expectation that they required."
bad,"The culture and work-life balance is good and even great with particular pay grades or certain job fields. With that said, upper management has no clear sense of direction or innovation. It is a good company but I would not want to be an investor."
bad,"American Express pays reasonably well at an hourly rate. However, their collections quotas and/or bonus structure DEMANDS that you basically read from a script AND be VERY good at it to excel anywhere."
bad,"Amex and USAID/OAPA didn't work well together for the Amex employees.  I have never had a work experience like that in my whole working career. Horrible experience."
bad,"Much of the management are abusive people. There is no culture of respect for the workers. He had over 4 hrs weekly MANDATORY overtime. There is no training, no respect for employees."
bad,"Its been nice to work with them but the work environment seriously sucks . They put unnecessary pressure on employees . The best thing was I meet lots of high profile people got a chance to learn lots of things from them , Even they share some experience also . It will help me in future ."
bad,"Typical day is long and the work is varied.  Variety of activity to complete the job is a plus.  If you are a self-starter, curious, and work well under pressure, it is a good fit.  Hardest part of the job is the lack of opportunity to advance."
bad,"Lo mas dificil era el horario, habia dias en que tu descanso era rotado, y en algunos casos que el cansancio te ganaba . no era lo mismo trabajar 8 horas seguidas que 10 o 12horas.. muy agotante"
bad,American Express may be a big company but if you don't play along with management they will make life very difficult for you and eventually force you out.
bad,Lack of mentorship to juniors and career development opportunities to seniors.
bad,World Class brand that made exceptional use of my selling skills to provide a very successful career across several continents with many of the household brands we know and love today.
bad,"This is my second time working at the company.  The first time was great - good culture, challenging and rewarding work."
bad,Great if you are looking for a corporate experience but very poor people management and slow career progression leading most employees to leave quite soon.
bad,"This job is completely unstable. In the first 8 months that I was there we were already on our 3rd supervisor. The sick time policy is a joke also. They give you 40hrs of paid sick time but using it counts as an ""occurrence"" and after 8 of those per year, you get fired, whether the sick time is there or not."
bad,I loved the location of the office.  Comp parking & lunch was provided daily.  Upper management was not approachable which made for a stressful work life.
bad,Run from this employer. This is a stressful job and they are sticklers about statistics. This is a great paying job but it's a dead end job. The Management is very poor.
bad,"Great initial interaction from APEX Systems, but after the signature of the contract, it becomes a sad parody of a mass-production scheme, a contractors mining facility where any workplace situation with the Client is systematically put into oblivion."
bad,"American Express was a really competitive work environment with a lot of job insecurity. Management ""permits"" you to eat lunch at your desk, but it is in reality a requirement that you do not take a break because if you do - it reflects poorly on your work ethic. My biggest frustration was that they do mass hirings and mass firings. Sure they get great candidates, but if you hire 44 people and fire 40 of them to get 4 good employees - that is just cruel."
bad,"the upper management of American express is very confused. they take drastic policy decisions without keeping the whole team in loop, causing mayhem, loss of productivity and job loss very oftem"
bad,"I miss the days of the previous CEO to the current one.  If you dont hail from India you have ZERO job security.  People are displaced on a regular basis, dont get too comfortable."

bad,Corramos detrás del cliente. Y este siempre te miraba por encima del hombro y la empresa mas
bad,"The training was less than stellar. When questions were asked, more often than not, the trainer was unable to answer them. Management staff isn't very friendly in the Merchant collections department. It's painfully obvious you are just a warm body in a chair."
bad,"Not happy with the work enviornment and management.Highly unorganised management in case of HR,and Admin.Had no motivation to work properly as there was no approprite Management who would appoint responsible manager to take care of business."
bad,If you're not on the phones the work atmosphere is great. If you're on the phones you may want to move around within the company so make sure you meet your quotas.
bad,Management not familiar with sales and customer service environment.  Based on $$ revenue only and not relationships with clients.
bad,They are a blood sucking leech on society.  There is no such thing as work life balance.  Promotions and advancement and bonuses have nothing to do with job performance or merit.  The VP was released for sleeping with and promoting people
bad,"Fast paced environment, with the potential of competitive compensation"
bad,I worked for Gatestone Co but specifically for American Express US. There is so much that I can say but it would all be negative so i will not; it takes guts and a strong back bone to work there for a long period of time and not many people will have that.
bad,"Senior Leadership needs to focus on security of the infrastructure that can expose financial systems and customers negatively.  Too much emphasis on drinking the kool-aid, not enough on getting meaningful work done."
bad,Book air/car and hotel travel plans for corporate companies we were contracted as their corporate travel company.
bad,"The job itself is good, however, management is terrible. Benefits are non-affordable for the average worker due to the huge deductible! Because it is a call center you are threatened with losing your job daily and you are tied to your cubicle. Little room for advancement unless you know ""someone"".. it's not about what  you know but ""who"" you know with this company! Tons of free lunches but then they wonder why all their employees are over weight when they are stuck at their desk 8 hours per day with 2 breaks and a lunch and no fitness center! If you boss doesn't like you then you will be fired-- so it is a lot of kissing butt! Outsourcing is their name- UGH!"
bad,"under paid"
bad,"The company was good. The management was very less than desirable. The type of work was good. "
bad,"Other than the high turnover rate and certain coaches who only care about looking out for themselves during training, AMEX is a great company to work for. A company is as good as its employees."
bad,The only reason contractors at American Express are treated as second-class citizens is that they don't have a third class.  Little to no management support: new employees / contractors must stumble around to find the resources they need.
bad,"The only part I liked in working for American Express was the vacation days offered, which were a lot compared to other companies. Why they offered so much vacation? Because the job environment was so stressful, I found that using up all my vacation was the only relief. If your are well educated and with experience the offer no opportunities for advancement, instead those opportunities are left to corporate politics.The healthcare was so expensive, it was not even worth it. A complete disappointment."
bad,"Not a very good company to work for. Managers, especially at the Director level were very disrespectful to their employees. They did not follow the company blue box values."
bad,Avoid unless you have no experience or don’t know what you’re doing. They prefer employees who don’t read AmEx policies and demonstrate no initiate or to complete tasks.
bad,"NO OF PEOPLE AT THE WORK LOCATION.They claim to be collaborative in the FIU but if you discuss a case or ask for clarity they tell you’re wrong with no further explanation. Please stay away they treat their contractors like trash and full time"
bad,"Public Image of Amex shows Work-life balance and non-biasnes, however that's not true! Every department within Amex has their own culture and goals, and does not provide flexibility to work."
bad,Sometimes communication is difficult with the diverse talent pool and the geographically diverse teams makes it a challenge but no effort is made to change/improve it.
bad,Why All business consultant reviews. Normal people work at Amex Service card members. Threats and cursing customers. No help from management as they have “made it” after hours no help from leads or managers as they are all gone home. I took a picture one night to show my manager no one was here to assist me and she politely scolded me for taking the picture. The pay is great but not worth my sanity
bad,ce fut une expérience dont je n'ai pas trop de souvenir
bad,The experience I had with this employer was a good experience overall. I would recommend it to others in the future. The environment was okay and not stressful.
bad,I wouldn't choose to work for them again. They tried to make you feel like they cared about you as an employee but they cared only when you became a thorn in their fake happy culture.
bad,American Express is an intriguing organization very hierarchical in structure.  They moved to a hotel style office environment that was not good if your job was on the phone.
bad,NO job security. Always doing layoffs and much outsouring to India and the Phillipines. They say the care about the customer but they care more about their bottom line.
bad,"Very Silo'd.  Multiple legacy systems that are not documented well for users.  As you learn and apply the systems, I often heard ""well the system has changed and you just need to know that"".  Many long term employees that have worked their entire career at American Express. Even so, long term employees are putting in their time ""waiting for when a layoff will hit them"".  Executive Leadership is committed to change yet they have not ensured the lower ranks are carrying out the mission."
bad,THIS WAS A PLACE OF BEING VERY COMPETITIVE WITH YOUR GOALS AND WINNING and being rewarded for reaching them...if you have the drive to win this is the place for you
bad,"I spent several years at this company, and experienced a very toxic and corrosive environment during that time. There was little to nothing spent/invested on development, even though the industry was changing before our eyes. The feedback was rarely constructive, but rather it was more negative and destructive. Management would have no issues with calling someone out in front of the team, regardless of the reason."
bad,"Monitoring CCTV"
bad,"If you are not in the 'In Crowd' you will be ousted fairly quickly. You can accomplish a ton a work but still be left to fight for your job daily. Great Company, bad organization."
bad,they are a usual contraction organization with contracts to look out for care more about the contracting company than their own employees. would not use them again
bad,Just sell credit cards that's what I learned. Staying on the phone and not getting sales is frowned upon. Getting off work most enjoyable part of day. They have no workplace culture
bad,"Years ago when I started at American Express it was a great place to work and a company I was proud to be a part of. As the years progressed the culture changed for the worse and management (in my area) was downright nasty. The environment was cut-throat and management tore people down instead of lifting them up. "

bad,"great place to work, but management needs a overhaul, Too much micro managing and managers are not fair. picking sides and too many clicks. moral was in the toilet and high turn-over rate."
bad,"I worked here so long ago that a review is pretty worthless, but the website is making me put one in so that I can continue.  Indeed is definitely not making points with me here"
bad,Lots of red tape to contend with which can be frustrating to accomplish even simple tasks.  Management is peer oriented so some nepotism going on here.  Benefits are good with the exception of high deductible health insurance plan with HSA account.

bad,"Amex is a 166 year old fat man. It is slow to evolve and unwilling to listen. People are NOT first and answers to most question are to the effect of ""its always been done that way"". Most long time leaders gave up the fight long ago. Its so sad to see the day to day."
bad,american express need to reevaluate the way its treats its employees amd card memebers. working there makes you feel that they are all about themselves
bad,"A typical day is loaded with conference calls, very fast pace environment with very little time in between sessions. However, the brand is awesome but under pressure to stay competitive.  Great benefits and additional days off.  You need them."
bad,After 18 yrs being a loyal employee American Express values no longer match the exceptional service first now priorities have changed and is geared towards a high sales priority minded customer service.
bad,"I lasted at Amex for a little over 3 months because that's all I could handle. This is a VERY stressful call center environment. The turn over rate in the customer service department is high for a reason! I had to deal with abuse day in and out from customers who speak to you as if you are a dog. The supervisors you call for ""help"" are not very helpful at all. In fact, they all hate their job, which makes yours even more difficult. I had to deal with other departments dumping (transferring calls without letting the customer know) calls on me when the customers were upset so that they wouldn't have to get a bad survey. "
bad,"New department that constantly changed the guidelines, it was hard to make quarterly commission, even though they said it wasn't. Environment was fun, co-workers were fun, but expectations were unrealistic. No benefits for using credit cards, etc.  Expected people to go around 6 am to get the job done when that was never agreed upon taking the job."
bad,I worked in the mutual fund accounting area that was spun off to become Ameriprise.  It was my first job out of college and it was a good first job and I even got one of my friends hired there.
bad,They only care about their brand and will sacrifice anything and anyone to avoid having the brand tarnished including keeping secret all of their data breaches.

bad,i worked for american express for over 30 years. I am very passional about my life and about my career. Unfortunately I was laid off due to downsizing. I feel I am fit for the position due my new experiance and knowledge with the new companies
bad,"While I do still believe that the card members are, for the most part, treated well and a ""white glove"" policy is in place, employees are treated much differently.  I work at the service center in Phoenix, where, even after layoffs, there are still a lot of people reporting to work every day.  The parking lot is correspondingly large and located a considerable distance from the front door.  Orange cones are frequently placed in (relatively) close spots to prevent the regular ""Joe"" from parking there.  Coffee is not offered as a perk to employees; rather, it must be purchased in the cafeteria.  Refills are $1.00 a cup.  Employees are not permitted to have their own single serve devices at their desks.  The company is extremely top-heavy, with approximately 1 ""leader"" to every 6-8 employees, with mid-level ""leaders"" leading them, followed by top-level ""leaders"" managing 2-3 tiers of ""leaders.""  If coming to work dressed casually to the point of flip-flops, decrepit jeans/shorts and ill-fitting shirts is your idea of Heaven, then come on down!  Trash cans are emptied every day, but the cleaning service does not vacuum the carpet - ever.  Most employees are working in 2-man cubicles, and even if you're not fat, it's very easy to bump the chair of your cube-mate just pushing away from your desk to stand up.  The same cold/cough/upper respiratory ailment gets passed around on a regular basis.  However, my biggest complaint is that employees working on a bonus plan are cheated every quarter.  Two months after Q1 2016 ended, we were notified that the number needed to make goal was raised"
bad,"Good jobs here are in software development engineering, service, and any Director, and VP level. Middle management gets killed and scapegoated here. The amount of work expected does not align with the resources given, especially while they did layoffs in early 2016. "
bad,Feel like a place for kids in college or something during the summer because it was like working in a high school from managers all the way down to new employees.
bad,The agents are very unprofessional and the supervisors interaction with the agents is also unprofessional. The company isn't completely bad there are some good things that have occurred there but the bad usually out weighted the good.
bad,Extremely micromanaged..Management is horrible in Small Business. The show favoritism more than any management I have seen. I was offered a promotion and then because I was only there 11 months instead of 12 the upper management told the other department I couldn't promote to there area.
bad,Policy changes on a regular basis. Management was never in the loop with changes being made. Poor attitude. The bonuses were not consistent
bad,Growing company that is having growing pains which is expected. Management changes a lot as well as employees. Human resources as well as training is somewhat efficient.
bad,"Very busy work place, typical day consisted of serving customers a 3 course meal, followed by after dinner drinks. Management was poor, they also kept leaving. Co-workers were often new or changed. Hardest part of the job would be the long hours and breaks not always given within those 12 hours."
bad,"-You work, take your breaks (2 15 minutes breaks and a 30 minute lunch). Can not use your phone at all on the floor because of customer information I understand, but if you had an emergency and a relative needed to call you, then they would have to call the job if they knew the number that is."

bad,In 3 years with this company I have seen so may layoffs and 19 yr veterans getting laid off. Its a revolving door because they are always changing something. Most of the time is it not beneficial to the employee.
bad,Had an honestly terrible time working for american express Brighton. I worked as a customer care professional and as an overall experience i can honestly say that it is the worst job i have ever had.
bad,"At American Express you have to be flexible and patient to deal with your customers day in and out. Management sometimes are not available and only notice you in most cases when something is going wrong. You don't always receive the positive feedback and receive the negative ones when you are doing your review. The hardest part of the job is getting your manager to understand what works and what doesn't. Getting their buy-in is sometimes difficult and would require trial and error, despite the use of six sigma. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people and being able to learn everything about running a business using project management."

bad,"Not happy working for this company Amex, it is like working for a factory if you get my meaning, they give you many many accounts and you have to work quality control as well as producing numbers under an overwhelming amount of stress; it is like a sweat shop."
bad,"High call volume, very stressful , poor management. Good pay & benefits, substantial paid time off. Difficult to advance out of customer care position if successful in that position."
bad,"Ever since the joint venture, Amex GBT became a very dry workplace that lacks any attraction. No development plan, no real opportunities for growth, salary increases are jokes, benefits being taken away one by one, objectives imposed by top management with no way to object, no funds for training, no team socialization. A lot of people promoted to leaders have no experience with leadership, and leaders hired from outside the company are even worse. Very political place where your performance is irrelevant to your success and growth within the company"
bad,The pay is Good pay but. Poor management. Poor coaching. Poor training. Stressful and very demanding. They didn’t give me a chance to learn my role. Very strict.
bad,"Horrible leadership/no opportunities to learn other responsibilities, I was not given any additional responsibility. I handled the same exact task for the year I was employed there. In addition, the manager spoke to me a few times in the year I was employed there."
bad,"no time to actually develop and lots of meetings that are unnecessary. Pay is pretty good, but very little room for advancement. Hard to find a career path when in a specific organization."
bad,"The work is incredibly redundant and mind-numbing. The internal politics are reminiscent of Mean Girls and it's very apparent. The upper management is very cliquey and if you get on someones bad side, consider yourself stuck. The saving grace is you can work from home most of the time, so you don't have to be in the toxic and childish environment."
bad,"At Sydney Office, there are multi-countries services departments."

bad,"No heat to new ideas, lot of company resources wasted on redundant work. Workplace atmosphere is very poor. Management does not know their subject themselves."
bad,Started out a great company not pushing sales but suggesting alternative situations to better fit your lifestyle. Lost Costco and it all changed. Wanted to push sales as hard as possible and drive employees to suggest an offer on every call. No matter the situation. Continued to up sales and goals to a limit to where they didn't have to lay people off but just fire them for the benefit of the company. Started switching calls out of USA to Manila. Can't see myself working for this company any longer personally. Can't leave your desk to use the bathroom felt like I was in grade school again. Don't believe them when they say you are not required to sell anything.
bad,Just do not apply for the Fraud department. This company is outsourcing a lot of positions to other countries. Pay was good but you are also doing a lot and above and beyond what you should be for it. Do not have their act together.
bad,"Employer par la société F.D.V. qui met souvent en ligne des annonces. J'ai été pendant quelques mois salarié pour eux dans leur filière American Express, en tant que commerciale. "
bad,"Difficult situation to stay motivated.  The company morale is poor due to a very, very high turnover rate.  The goals that are set are unattainable due to slow computers and lack of staff."
bad,"This job is fairly repetitive in task, which can become mundane. The culture is easy going yet very regimented. I learned a lot about travel agents and travel coordination."
bad,"Management is not shy about picking favorites. If they do not like you or you are not putting in enough effort to ""fit in"" they will push you aside and find someone else. They have strong opinions about you as a person and are not afraid to voice those to you or to others. You get paid well, but the work life balance is off."
bad,no chance of being promoted. stay away. management is very shady here would often overlook blatant violation of federal collection law
bad,"Extremely unstable, constant lay offs, no advancement opportunities. Bad management practices. Negative outlook for the next two years."
bad,"This was a great place to work when I started, even as a call center"
bad,"When you think of large corporations like Amex, you really expect them to have hiring & new employee orientation down to a pattern.  After all, they hire new people all the time."
bad,"Lot of unnecessary pressure. Basic salary is low, Incentives are high"
bad,"Politics rampant, fake culture, definitely a testing ground if you want to see if Corporate life is for you."
bad,"managemnt and workplace..same has been discussed erlier"
bad,"Amex despite being a large financial organization misses the point on many different levels. It has, unfortunately, a poor culture leaving it as a very undesirable work environment."
bad,"The environment is very stressful due to workload and demands plus always worrying about layoffs.  The moral is low and feel like the Company does not care about its employees, only about making money quickly vs quality, Very quick - pace again quality suffers."
bad,"This position was a great opportunity to work in the banking industry"
bad,There is biased management. Favors only female employees. There is no work and life balance. Job culture is not good. Politics is all around. There is no encouragement for your work
bad,"Management at this company is great!  They do their best to treat you well and with respect.  Overall however, this is a huge corporation that cares about statistics and metrics much more than the needs/wellbeing of the lowly employee.  The hours are terrible unless you've been with the company 10+ years.  The first few years you can expect to work 3-11pm and your days off may not be consecutive.  You MUST work 4 stat holidays a year (which means all the 'goods ones' for anyone without years of tenure - Christmas eve, Christmas, Boxing day, New Years Eve).  Every movement is tracked (ie: how long your bathroom breaks are, when you take your breaks -- if breaks are taken even 5 minutes late you will be reprimanded).  You must take as many calls as possible to the point that the stress is overwhelming....I began to feel panicked all the time"
bad,"I worked my tail off for Amex.  When I left, one Manager asked, who is going to make sure new employees are on-boarded with what they need on the very first day?  You were always so good at that.  One of my VP's said, ""You're very good at what you do.""  But he was a narcissist, and we never got along!"
bad,American Express strives on the diversity and culture of it's employees.  They have a lot of amazing opportunities if you fit the mold. But it is not based on personal performance. There is an immense amount of favoritism and judgement.  Not all management hindered advancement.  This company made me question myself personally and professionally.
bad,Pay has largely decreased due to incentive pay based solely on surveys. If you get one survey that is very good instead of excellent you will most likely receive 10% or 0% of your bonus payout for the month. Used to make upwards of $3000 for bonus now making $0 due to bad survey.
bad,The employer maintained an open door approach to dilemmas in the workplace.  Several individuals were promoted to to exceptional performance.
bad,"This was my first job, it was definitely a learning point as i was given the task to sell credit cards via phone. I learned to art of selling and negotiating ."
bad,"There are way too many senior level managers. As an example (as of May 8, 2016) there are 13,728 Directors inside American Express. They are currently trying to correct poor market share by cutting $1,000,000,000 out of their budget for 2017. While they assured all employees that there would be minimal staff reduction, they have already begun to let 100's of employees go. The Directors have no say over who stays and who goes from their department."
bad,"80% of the phone representatives have Fmla or disability because of the high level of stress involved with this job. 100+ fast paced calls a day. Not all of them are bad but some are borderline abusive and american express will not protect you.  Your job is completely dependant on customer surveys which you have no control over. Great pay and work flexibility but poor medical benefits. Its extremely difficult to move up in the company and if you do, its usually only temporary. Breaks are terrible. Very challenging 3 part interview process as well."
bad,Environnement difficile et très peu d'évolution de carrière...
bad,"La empresa esta enfocadad a resultados."

bad,The work was very challenging as I was involved in the development of a domain like MobilePayments. Currently I am playing the role of TechLead in this project and I was responsible for design and implementation of many services which is part of the the core capability which we build for ApplePay.
bad,The company shut down and we all had to find other jobs.  I really didn't like that west lost the contract.
bad,"Uma empresa viva e agradável de trabalhar."
bad,"The hiring process is very difficult and drawn out but the pay and benefits are excellent BUT PLEASE BEWARE.  When you are hired, you are told that this is not just a job; it's a career and that you are now here for life...you are now PART OF THE FAMILY.  You are given the impression that you are a permanent employee from day one.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.  You must go through a training process and instead of basing your permanent hire on how well you did in the training process,  your permanent hire is based on surveys that you receive in a very, very flawed system.  You will receive bad surveys from card members you never even talked to or regarding issues like...American Express making a corporate decision to remove an airport lounge access which has nothing to do with the service you provided that card member just their dissatisfaction with a corporate decision that you took no part in but YOU will get that bad survey and they will constantly tell you that there is nothing they can do about you now being stuck with that bad survey although they listen to those calls and know that it had nothing to do with you but that one bad survey may very well keep you from getting a permanent hire.  Also, keep in mind that in order to wipe out 1 bad survey, you must get at least 5 excellent surveys...yeah, that math makes no sense to me either.   Additionally, with the mess they have with the company that manages their surveys, your surveys are sometimes held for 10 days and when 1 bad survey and only two good surveys in a week can destroy your possibility of being permanent,"
bad,There is a day care on premise as well as a cafe to have lunch. Good health benefits.
bad,On the phone all day hearing complaints....Management was stellar and tried to keep employees motivated.
bad,"Loved coming into work, having my coffee and then signing out at end of day, which was the best part."
bad,Found it to be challenging in the later years due to their products and methods not very suitable for customers.
bad,Conditions de travail déplorables (open space géant)
bad,SG cen management team isn't sure with their KPI's and never shares the business strategies with their employees. No empowerment given to it's employees for decision making
bad,"The company was good with the payment structure and incentives. The work was complete pressurized. Sales oriented office culture. Long working hours and no proper support from the HR team."
bad,"Offered 401k, medical insurance, dental insurance, and vision care. Depending on the number of years of employment depending upon the amount of PTO you received."
bad,"When entering into this role you will find out this is contractual, most of the time these guys will only hire if the budget allows it or find someone else to hire as a contractor for that role. There is no benefits, people are immature, management is terrible, watch out for the downtown st. petersburg location as this is not a good work environment for the pay per hour."
bad,"At American Express, campaigns take a long time to execute because there are just so many layers of approvals required. There are a lot of politics as can be expected with any organization of this size."
bad,"Your dealing with rich platinum card holders who are mostly rude and obnoxious and irritable, beaks are short and your tied to your desk like your in jail tied to your headseat with someone screaming in your ear. No wonder they pay so much and offer almost a month off."
bad,"Sedgwick for American express is stressful, its a revolving door and the attempted resolution is to require those that do work to do mandatory overtime with less than a weeks notice.  Afterworking the OT your check is usually incorrect and it takes so long to fix it that it never works out to be an actual increase in your check- management isn't on the same page so rules with one manger may be completely opposite with another.  every month a team of over 12 people are hired, half leave before training is over and the rest tend to leave withing about 4 months..."
bad,Good work environment but management doesn’t care if you hit goal or lead your team. They only identify where you could have done more. Even though I had exceeded goal I was ridiculed for having an hour here or there with not many phone calls due to researching before making my contacts. A true dial nonstop environment.
bad,"Worked for American Express for almost 5 years. While I was there, the work itself was fine, the pay was good, the benefits were nice, and my peers were decent. One fine day they pulled all of us off the phones and in a big meeting officially announced company layoffs. Turns out they would rather pay someone from the Philippines pennies on the dollar to do the same work. Yeah, they really put the 'American' in American Express alright. Not! Not to mention that many, many folks have had their personal info compromised due to outsourcing. At any rate, I want nothing to do with Amex and would strongly caution anyone for working with this company as they can and will get rid of you just as quickly as they hired you."
bad,"It was a great place to work until they decided to send jobs to other countries."
bad,"I loved my clients with American Express. The bonus structure was set up as a no win situation."
bad,"Good company to work for,free wifi,eight hours shift,noPressure of work,good"
bad,"Unfortunately, most of the jobs in New Accounts Department are relocated to India regardless their quality is not compatible to the local ones."
bad,"I spent the last 6 years of my life working here and although there were up's and many downs the one thing that remained constant throughout my experience there was having the privilege of working with such amazing people. "
bad,My review was above and beyond ...everything I did was great...My attendance wass great...bearly took sick time
bad,"-Data Center upgrades and migrations in Arizona and North Carolina"
bad,auto dialer. learned world class customer service. co workers were rude. hardest part was could really take breaks. no enjoyable times.
bad,American Express prides themselves as being a great place to work. However my experience was otherwise the training was intense 4 weeks learning in the classroom and 2 months of OJT you must certify or you will be terminated. Doing collections for special customer which are their card members who spend over 30k you will be verbally abused by their card members the metrics the dpt have are attainable but it’s sooooo much stress just to get there! The surveys are ridiculous! I personally don’t want to work for a company I feel like I am walking on egg shells! But if you like that type of environment I say go for it !
bad,"4 years ago I wanted to retire here.. great pay... great variety of sales. After they lost Costco, it has been nothing but chaos. The reps who work 40+ hours have to forfeit some or all of their commissions because the company gives you 15 metrics to hit each month and screw with the systems and their HORRIBLE surveys system to find ANY WAY possible to NOT pay you. Bsides that the health care is great (pricey tho) and they match 401k... but HORRIBLE LEADERSHIP from up top."
bad,"C'est une entreprise dite Américaine avec un management à l'américaine mais c'est pas tout à fait la réalité. On vous mets la pression pour des futilités, on vous mets des rapports d'avertissements sans aucun justificatif et sans pouvoir défendre votre cause. On veut vous mettre de plus en plus de travail sur le dos sans vouloir vous augmenter. Argent Argent, on pense pas aux salariés et aux difficultés de notre métier. Je conseille American Express dans d'autres service que le mien, mon service c'est ""le service poubelle"". Le salaire est correct avec pas mal d'avantages (Tickets Resto, Tickets Nöel, bonne mutuelle..)"
bad,Good place to work. Enjoyed working. long working hours. good salary package. No personal life. Good canteen good food. Environment is good. People appreciative
bad,"They do not care about actually servicing, it is all about sales and how much $ you can make for everyone above you and if you don't sell they're going to find a way to get rid of you. They are letting people go that should not be and the only people who get promoted are friends of those in higher positions. The pay is NOT worth it!"
bad,Company is more on budget / $ side and did not care much about the employees value.  They rather contracting out to offshore without considering the quality of services.  American Express of Canada will never be the same as in the old office of Markham.
bad,Great place to advance and managers are very helpful.  Work life balance only downside. Schedules change often and very difficult to plan around it.
bad,"The upkeep is poor and the management is much worse, there is a consistent flow of work however so there's never a dull moment."
bad,It seems like it would be a good place to work. a typical day is just on the phones... because the nature of american express most of the time your talking to rude rich people. mainly offer temporary contracts so they can get rid of you easily.
bad,Amex recognized work difficulty by paying a wage over and above what other campaigns in the call centre were paying
bad,Many re-organizations within the company lead to job insecurity.
bad,"When I first started working there, I was really proud to be a part of this company. I liked the diversity and my boss helped me to move up by working in different departments. The work was quite tedious and I got bored a lot.my problem was that they paid so little yet had great benefits"
bad,"Azienda all'avanguardia, lavoro in team. Esperienza formativa"
bad,My only complaint was they had a shift bid every so often and gave bonuses ( older employees knew how to work the system- management didn’t care). Love the co workers.
bad,"The only reason I left Was my direct manager. Who was dismissive, a micro manager and not a good leader. Its left me with a bad taste of the whole experience at Amex and I would never work there again."
bad,"- Travel arrangements to places all over the world"
bad,"Great pay, Cool management team but the opportunities for advancement suck.  If you accept a contracting position with this group, expect to be done with assignment in 6-8 months."
bad,"Worked as Customer Service Took inbound calls from applicants who applied Reviewed to confirm if could be Fraud, Then I either approved or declined application. I also requested Additional information if needed. I worked in marginal team would review applications the system wants to decline to determine was ok to approve. I also took calls to activate cards, collected missing info added and activated the cards."
bad,Compensation is for those who know how to beat the system.  If your honest you will lose out to others when comes to matrix numbers and production.  Excellent time off allowances
bad,"Company was way too big and in complete disarray, Ratio of back office to agents was ridiculous, departments that duplicated the work without knowledge of one another, while the front agent couldn't get answers or support when needed. This translated into poor customer service to the client."
bad,"I loved working for American Express I wanted to retire with them, I worked there 26 yrs and then they out sourced our jobs to India. I learned you can not trust corporate American they will cut your job faster than you can blink,"
bad,"People at America Express are the main reason why I worked there for such a long time."
bad,"Helping people with Membership points"
bad,"I have nothing much to say about this company."
bad,The company has great products but the culture is very cut throat.   Getting ahead usually means you need to step on top of other people to do it.    Favoritism and cronyism are very much the culture.
bad,The work responsibility at Amex was not good. It did not appeal to me as challenging. It was more a duplicating work than strategic and creative thinking work contrary to the job title.
bad,"my day at work is always good, i learned to manage my people and my staff is great, cant complain about my co workers, when we have a lot of people checking in, it can get tuff but its excited, and we see smile on people face is when we enjoy it the most."
bad,The management is literally the worst. The only person whose word held any ground with me was the guy who taught my training class.
bad,"I still have many friends that are apart of American Express and they are constantly filled with fear of lay offs, performance reviews, and constant push for achievement.  Amex taught me a lot but mostly how to keep my head down. They have some good benefits like tuition reimbursement, but the insurance is very costly with a high deductible for lower band employees, the higher band employees, managers and above, actually have better insurance with lower deductibles, I think that is pretty despicable. They convince you its the best place to work and that you couldn't find anything better. Their hourly pay is low and tied to incentives which used to be reasonable to reach and have high payouts for top performers, which really offset the negative.  The goals have changed many times and the payouts are now not achievable or have a low pay out.  The Amex customers are disgruntled and speaking with that type of person all day long definitely takes a toll. The advancement there is tied to WHO YOU KNOW and pretty much nothing else.  SO many times during an interview I heard, ""Why didn't you ask someone to put a word in for you...""  After I heard that for the tenth time I put in my two weeks and moved on.  I have had so much success since leaving  Amex; it feels good to be valued for what you know and not who you hang out with on the weekends."
bad,"Politics runs the organization unfortunately. You can advance with the right manager, otherwise you will get stuck and leave once you can't handle the passive aggressive culture anymore."
bad,"A typical day at work includes meetings and solving client issues."
bad,"Company provided excellent training to obtain required licenses, but lead generation was below expectations."
bad,Has it ups and downs but it is a job to work.The company has good benefits for some travel but there are issues with management and policy that is not right it is very stressful.
bad,No me gustaba .Porque no me considero un vendedor..Tenia que vender tarjetas amex
bad,"Learned: Reconciliation, SOX compliance , Balance sheet reporting."
bad,"American Expres CPS "
bad,working at American express was great however you have to be very careful how information is shared and also who it is shared with. At american express there is lots of politics and lots of favoritism
bad,"Feels like a factory line.  Treated like children  not flexible in anyway"
bad,I thoroughly enjoyed my job at American Express.  The market crashed in 2009 and I had not choice but to transition to a new field.  I did love traveling and meeting clients throughout the Southeast!!!
bad,great bounce.. great company ..they do care about their employees has a good culture but no room for advance great benefits but could be stressful sometimes .
bad,"Results matters in the organization. Goal & target oriented organization. Very flat  in growth perspective.  Some, time you may feel out dated in the industry."
bad,"Good people, good salary, decent benefits. Constant lay offs. They lay people off multiple times a year. I worked there for 15+ years, for the last ten years you always had to worry about getting laid off. Eventually. I was laid off."
bad,I did not enjoy my time at American express management is not that great. They are not an organized company. The systems are all out of date. My management lacked knowledge in all things foreign currency.
bad,Taking care of our most honored platinum card members issues and complaints . obtained the ability to balance effective listening with quick problem solving skills
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customer to book reservations, making refunds and exchanges to reservations."
bad,"cant really dictate your money based off the commission structure, needs improvment from the management to the training and the information thats provided to the rep most importantly card updates ."
bad,"Great work life balance but a very slow paced company, too much concentration on BANDS of the employee rather than actual work. "
bad,They have change a lot since the new owners. When I started It was a very good company the benefits were great. Its not the same anymore. We have to work on weekends once every 3 months.
bad,WARNING If you have never worked at a call center before this is a very tough job.  Card members can be absolutely rude and disrespectful.  It is highly stressful if you are not use to call center type of work.  I wish I would have been able to have dealt with it because the benefits are great and the pay is not bad either.
bad,"excellent soft skills, customer service #1 rated top collector 10 years, inter personal skills, mentored department on how to become excellent in strive in customer service, assisted customers to enable spend to build business needs"
good,"I stuck this job out for as long as I could. I'd done corporate travel for 10+ years, but being a part of the Platinum Card Travel Services team was less than ideal. I was given a late shift that left me struggling with to find my footing. I was told that I had to take no more than 20mins per call. The more complex the request was, the longer it took to book the travel. It didn't help that during my own shift from the time I started my shift at 3pm until 10pm, there were always to many agents. I would sit for hours waiting for a call, if it wasn't new travel I was sewing up the transaction for another agent. "
good,You have to work on your own time. And your not paid. The insurance was expensive $500/ month. The premiums were high with an outrageous out of pocket deductible. I had for a familynof 2 $5700 and then after that I had a co insurance. If you or your family is sick. You will use your entire paycheck to cover medical costs.
good,"I worked in travel department and I loved the job , but their was no respect to how long you have been with the company. Employees with many years were let go if their sales weren't meet over a two month peroid. This company needs a union CWA very badly  . Most of management do not have degrees either."
good,"Unsupportive Management. "
good,"Really hard to advance unless your well liked and act like a puppet.  Human resources never listened to concerned.  Staff did not follow protocol when it came to no cell phones on the floor, dress code became very casual.  Breaks and lunchs are Unpaid."
good,Supervisors only look out for each other the employees do not matter. The rules and compensation changes on a monthly basis. You will never feel as though you have any type of job security.
good,"Be prepared, confident and dress professionally. Health Insurance is expensive, high deductible!! Basically health care is for catastrophic problems.   No flexibility on schedules."
good,I liked working for the company and I enjoyed the people. I came across unfortunate conditions and had to leave the company. I was told I am still rehireable there because of my good work ethic. I would like to expand my experience to something that allows me to move around a little more and work with people in an environment where there is room to grow.
good,"A clash of toxic work culture in Arizona Phoenix with many contractors and cheap H1B workers. No gym, no facilities. Equivalent to a sweat shop. Full-time citizen employees enjoy while H1B workers burn their midnight oil for production bugfixes."
good,Amex has its merits and gave me a great deal of experience and boosted my resume. However it would be hard for me to return without a huge increase in my pay and a guaranteed internal position at the Band 35+ range.
good,"Already I have given my view about that organization. "
good,"American Express had its pros and cons like any other company.  Years ago when i worked for them, the culture was that if you did not have a college degree, you were considered 'nothing' and a 'non-professional'.  The upper management was terrible in that they were rude and demanding."
good,Since this was through a contracted company there were some limitations that were a little different from being in the corporate office. The opportunity to become a fully licensed insurance agent it invaluable.
good,working for American Express Travel is like working for a schizophrenic that suffers from Bi-Polar disorders.  There is a constant waiting for the shoe to drop feeling.  There is always an underlying current of unrest and insecurities that run through the travel department
good,Competitive sales environment. Peers are helpful and very easy to get along with. Paid time off is difficult to schedule but you get it up front at the beginning of the year.
good,"Cuando uno le hecha ganas es facil progresar pero la vida personal se abandona muy facil, ademas hay demasiadas envidias por parte de personal que lleva mas tiempo alli y no ha progresado, y por parte de la gerencia no se hace nada al respecto, recursos humanos apoya la primer version que escuchan y nunca investigan bien los hechos, en resumen muy mal ambiente laboral"
good,good people who taught  me  how  to work  in professional  it was totally different experience in my life lot it is big organization so i got lot of  co- worker  over there. all of them nice nature & cooperative
good,"management is not good and work culture also not good"
good,Met some great salesmen/women and learned a lot. We were located in a mall and sort of canvassed pedestrians and informed them of all the perks of the current promotional credit card American Express was offering. If the person was interested in applying for the card we would help expidite the process and submit their applications.
good,Great but my dept was relocated. I enjoyed all the different people I was able to help and prevent from being frauded. I liked the managers I had and the peer nominations and the constant updates on training and new products we would receive.
good,ambiente di lavoro falso e ambiguo. non si cresce per merito ma per raccomandazione
good,"American Express is a fairly decent company to work for. It is a very network friendly environment, relationships are VERY important here. Medical benefits can be improved, they have high deductible insurance. Your advancement depends on your manager, if you have a good manager you will move up, if you don't you will most likely need to switch teams or departments to do so.  The work perks and employee discounts are excellent. They also do a lot of philanthropic work."
good,"I worked at Amex for 6 years and found that the management of the company is inconsistent across business units, the top layer of management never changes and becomes stale (they just rotate around), implementing decisions without completely disrupting operations is impossible because no one takes time to understand impact of their decisions, and no one at the top takes accountability for anything.  You can run a business unit into the ground and make employees miserable and dissatisfied, and still be at the company 5 years later doing something else.  "
good,"I use to love working for this company. Too many changes all for the worst, only to make them more money and less for you. Over 17 Managers fired, year after year of moving departments to other countries."
good,I do not wish to add anything on working with this company. I dont understand why this should be important in the job application process and ideally it should not even be part of each application
good,"American Express pretty much left me in the dark most of the time. Very little communication about the job or who exactly cares. Most communication was via a team member whom I did not really answer to. They seemed quite disorganized cared little about my skillset or utilization of them. I often had no idea if my job was going to be dissolved due to transitions even though I was praised and had high marks as a top performer. "
good,"I loved working for American Express, however manager of my last position was unable to lead. With the lay - offs and benefits changing. I decided to leave AMEX"
good,Företag med högt i tak som tyvärr på senare tid glömt bort sin personal.
good,"Boss/owner had family members working there and they were most obviously favorites.  When layoffs began, the first to leave were no-family members."
good,"I was hired and advised that there would be flexability with Thing5 in the schedules and was also told that we were not sales agents and we are there to provide extraoridnary customer service to American Express Platinum Card Members. All of the above is not true. We are rushed to finish each call, which is not giving the agents enough time to create an itinerary (some international). We as agents are held fully accountable for what Cardmembers think of AMEX. And when I say held fully responsible, you can be fired for a bad ""survey"" and it will predict your shift when the bids are out, shift bids last 3 months. I have never worked in a call centre in all of my working career and I think I never want to work in another one after this."
good,"Your job is based on quality, if you don't have that customer service they are looking for this job is not for you."
good,Great firm in terms of work life balance
good,"I've worked at worse places, but this wasn't a great experience."
good,"Convention mgmt is very closed to ideas re improvement of sales effort. Most direct mgmt is on a fast track program giving them little incentive to change any techniques"
good,"Good"
good,"Though very proud to work for American Express due to it's reputation in the financial industry, it was very competitive and stressful.  Almost annually there were reorganizations possibly changing your manager, team, reporting structure, compensation, goals, etc.  This caused a lot of stress in addition to very aggressive sales and account management goals. You worked nights and weekends on a regular basis to get the job done."
good,"Highly political, and not a meritocracy.  Company values do not filter down the ranks at lower leadership levels (VP/Director), and no one is willing to fix this - its baked into the review process to compete with your colleagues.  Flexible work schedule is a positive, but does no make up for lack of leadership integrity."
good,"Nice place to work.  It's been a while, but I remember it being very laid back and not overly demanding.  I'm sure it has changed quite a bit since I was last there."
good,"Good career opportunities ,fair pay and compensation."
good,"If you love constant changes this is the place. When first employed was under impression of being just customer service. Yet when large merger loss, intense sales pressure. The demand of constant being available with no flexibility with schedules. Kind of the giving candy to child in the beginning then taking it away later."
good,The work environment is great but the company core values isn’t what they stand by. What they need to work is leadership Involvement. To help motivate and give us a reason to work harder
good,"I was in the business development team  with American express. The environment is good in terms of office environment. The high level management is only concerned of there own growth. If the management was not concerned about me I wouldn't have been searching job. "
good,"Job posting and the training I received was supposed to be as a credit analyst.  Looking at credit card clients for their credit issues and determining if we should extend more or less to them.  It ended up being glorified collections and calling people who were late on their bills."
good,"Good exposure to corporate clients. Salary structure has big portion in variabe which can be pro as well as con basis you skills. If you are good at achieving numbers, good place to make money."
good,"I had a very good professional experience in American Express, the only problem was that the salary was very low, even if AMEX has atractive comisions scheme, to reach a good income is very difficult."
good,"Its a nice place to work , work life balance is a plus, however does not give administrative staff bonuses as with all other positions about an analyst role"
good,During quarter close the job is based on managing restructuring reserves for a $1 billion based expense organization.  During off quarter close the job is based on completing various projects to help improve the business and ensure correct accounting practices.
good,"Not a bad place to work if you are okay with working 70 hour weeks to be successful. "
good,American Express has a very competitive work culture. Expectations are sometimes unrealistic and impractical. They have a fun work place but you have to keep up with the constant changes that are being made by the management in the systems and processes.
good,I would not recommend working for American Express.  The middle management team is lacking in leadership and focus.  Many very good people have left to pursue other interests.
good,We use to sit in Mckinsey and Company on behalf of American express . Good atmosphere all together . But if you talk about American express no managment at all . Working without a leader from last 4 months . Need to Grow and ready to do any type of Hardwork for that
good,"For a number of years American Express Network Development (ND) later called “Digital Merchant Servicing (DMS)” has seen repeated reorganizations or “transformations” with changes of strategy and then reversals of those changes of strategy. These reorganizations have had a significant impact upon employment - especially upon contract/agency workers. "
good,every day is typical day for us because reaching our target is very difficult and i learned many things from seniors like how to convince the customer and how to manage the customers
good,The management was good. The co workers were helpful. I got a thorough knowledge of Inbound US calling for the Mortgage process.
good,"It was just ok, could be better. I don't know about now."
good,"This place is not a motivational place to work. Stressfull environment, and not a fun place to be."
good,As IT working for business side there are conflicts of understanding what needs to be done.
good,American Express is a great place to work.  It is provides many opportunities to grow and advance your career while providing a balanced work/life experience. American Express even goes so far as to have have a back-up daycare service attached to the building for those times you need it.  
good,Overall Amex is a fine place to work but most of the time the work load is too much.
good,"I had a long, productive career at American Express, including being supervisor, floater (covering for people who were either sick or short staffed offices), training new employees, script writing. Worked first half of tenure in New York City, and second in New Jersey."
good,Developed and delivered internal training on processes and procedures. Developed and delivered Product training to clients.
good,"Don't ever get a Workman's Comp injury. They find any loop hole they can to fire you. I loved my job, was top 3 in my department. Then I was injured and it spiraled downhill from there."
good,"Delivered accurate and expedited domestic travel reservations including air transportation, airline ticket exchanges, hotel reservations, and ground transport. Acknowledged for consistent high-level customer service ratings for business travel clients. Acknowledged for consistent superior record of achieving requirements for company production levels."
good,Typical call center environment. Took close to 80 calls per day to try to service customer needs and upsell them to increase their card services.
good,"Always had a choice to be or not to be in office. They need more experience managers, however. It seems as most of the managers in the office have no real-world experience."
good,"Pressure on production. If you could work like a donkey and say yes to everything, then you can see yourself growing. I think that its only the India center which has this kind of environment. Elsewhere, I have heard its good."
good,Aprendí mucho y los horarios eran muy buenos. Cada día era distinto y eso era muy estimulante.
good,Room for moving up are only available to a select few. You are expected to cover for other departments that are not your own and come in on holidays to cover for other departments that are not your own.
good,No comments its a long time since I left the organisation and the Bank entity which Amex held in India has been sold to Standard chartered Bank which any way was in the offing due to lack of will to expand in the market
good,A typical day at work is answering phone calls and assisting customers in their travel needs whatever that may be. Most of the time I was sending emails or responding over the phone to customer complaints.
good,"Mucha competitividad, no hay buen ambiente debido a la misma. No saqué buenas sensaciones en mi breve estancia allí."
good,"I did not fit in with a corporate culture. The expectation was that work would always come first. On the plus side, the money was good and there was plenty of travel."
good,"Working in customer service was challenging and informative.  The work was constant because of the calls coming in to either approve, if the customer records indicated, or deny a purchase because of the customer's payment history."
good,"Either you're in the good graces of your team leader or you're not, there's in between. If you're not in their good graces you're ignored and not given the opportunity to succeed. You go into the position as being advertised ""servicing"" but the push for sales is more important. If you're not a top sales performer you're ignored. The metrics are STRICT. Management doesn't fix pay in a timely manner, or ever in my case. The call volume is INTENSE. I worked 10 hour days and took 120+ calls each day. The pressure to sale on every call is outrageous - even if the CM can't make their minimum payments. I will say the benefits are outstanding and working from home was incredible."
good,"I learned how to use electric tools, how to hard work, making walls, cutting with soe. In my opinion that work was not well paid and risky enviroment. So i decited to change somewthing"
good,The people at Amex were really great to work with until around 2015 when everything seemed to change.  Senior leadership started to operate based on fear and that emanated down the lines. Leaders forgot to how to lead and instead used fear and threats to try to get things done. There was a huge focus on the short term and no support or appreciation for long term results or strategies. The inspiration and strong leadership that I had known in years past was replaced with counterproductive shaming and disrespect I had never seen before. I think people forgot that we were on the same team and people turned against each other instead of working together.  There are a lot of opportunities at Amex but the culture may be too difficult to take advantage of them.
good,They pretty much treated me good. No benefits. Not too many other issues with them. Management was ok. If you took time off you were out money no PTO or Sick time for temp employees.
good,Fun environment but they were late on commission checks and base pay is low. The best part of the job was the people that worked there and the managers were motivating.
good,"The management team was very rude & did not care about true customer service and more about keeping your calls to the lowest time possible. The work life balance doesn't exist. The only good thing about this company is the pay & vacation time."
good,"The environment is fairly relaxed, the people here are friendly and they are never irrational. There's a cafeteria within the building as well as access to some shops right outside in Brookfield Place."
good,"NA"
good,"low pay, terrible management, buddy system to get ahead, nepotism....just nota good environment to work in....unless you like belittled by people who sucked up to get where they are"
good,"American Express is a great place to work, I used to work as a contractor but still I'm aware of all the policies of American Express."
good,I enjoyed working with clients of American Express Tax and Business Services.  The corporate culture was difficult because American Express the parent company changed Chief Executive Officers about every six months and all processes changed that often.  Hard to keep up with what was expected in the job.
good,Great for your first experience as you will learn a lot.  Project groups are relatively small which means collaboration and cross reference of work can be challenging.  Face-paced so if you're a quick learner it is exhilarating to work in this environment.
good,"Lots of opportunities given the scale and reach. At the same time, lots of red tapes given the size of the company.                                               ."
good,Our only goal was to upgrade cardholders to the platinum status so the job was repetitive and unfulfilling. We would call out to existing card holders and find the benefits of upgrading and then close the deal.
good,"They need to open up more direct hire full time job positions with benefits for the contractors. We shouldn't have to work for a company for over a year or more before you're even considered to get in the door permanently as an employee. It truly is a competitive cut throat numbers game there and you're constantly under pressure and stress. If you're numbers aren't up to speed, you'll simply be replaced the very next day."
good,"es una empresa cómoda para gente que quiere vivir comodamente, pero en mi opinión funciona demasiado la promoción por afinidad más que por talento interno."
good,"Plenty of things to do while on break great cafeteria overall the work is not what I was expecting, the job description when I applied was not what it actually was when I started"
good,It's all about making the numbers. Pressure to sell strong. Customer feedback? You own it even if not your customer. Bonus money is good but near impossible to earn.
good,"Management was okay. There was no balance between work life and personal life. Employees was paid very less. Since it was just selling credit cards, I learnt handling direct customers."
good,"I am grateful for the postion I had at American Express.  The benefits were outstanding and the people I worked with were the best part of the job.  Professionally, I learned a great deal and worked in many areas building my busness knowledge .  However, after 25 years I was ready for  a change and retired. As time went on the metrics and goals became more demading and more difficult to achieve. The company lost sight of realistic goals and came to disregard its most valuable resource its, people."
good,the job is very stressful if you let the managers and sales get to you!! for this to be a company that has been around for a long time the management is horrible... its very stressful and allot of times you will find inconsistency in the info that you are give! the pay and benefits are Great but its hard to stay focused becasue you do not know what to do about allot of situations and things are just not clear or transparent as it should be be a very simple and easy day!!
good,American Express is stuck in the past and leadership is the core issue. To change the culture and to reinvent themselves they will have to start from the top.
good,"Job is very tedious and demanding"
good,"Good on the job training opportunities, very light on any training that has cost associated to it. "
good,"Same thing everyday"
good,"Basic perks of the job are responsibility and security, global business with much advancement opportunity when they are not downsizing"
good,"American Express is a leader in the financial services industry.  They offer superior customer service and products for their cardmembers.  I felt a sense of pride to work for them because of the company brand and reputation.  Unfortunately, there's a price to pay (for the employees) in order to help the company to remain on top of their game.  In IT, we have to work long hours in order to meet unreasonable expectations of our business partners.  Also, there isn't a consistency in leadership styles among people in management.  One person may have a great leader who motivates their team and rewards effort making that person feel valued which leads them to want to go above and beyond.  Someone else may have a leader that lacks all of that.  There's no faith in job security as the company has done some type of restructuring pretty regularly over the last several years which has caused many people to lose their jobs.  You don't know from one to the next whether you will be working there.  The base pay is below market but I guess they try to make up for it in benefits.  The company culture has changed drastically from when I started working there."
good,I logged in and out according to my daily schedule.  I learned the required policies & procedures and the appropriate verbiage to communicate them to the customer.   I only got to communicate with my co-workers through the company messenger service when there was time to as the calls were back to back and it was against policy to send messages unrelated to the call with the customer.
good,"Log in early, begin taking call after call of credit card consumers regarding their business accounts.  To ask questions you send a chat message to your supervisor and hope for a fast response since you have the customer listening to you at all times.  It is very fast paced and high stress.  The customer expects quick work and you need to be on your a-game.  Little to no breaks and a very short lunch, most of which is unpaid.  Expectations are high as customers are emailed surveys based on the call experience and you are rated based on that."
good,"Company leadership support ITSM but don't always understand the complicated integration and support requirements."
good,"Management and advancements were low, but the company is a good a company to work for."
good,"La giornata tipo è improntata sull'acquisizione di nuovi clienti, è un'attività difficile e non pagata adeguatamente in proporzione alla produzione."
good,Good flex schedule 4-10's Mon-Thursdays. Went from CSR to more of a Soft Sales position before I left. Not sure how it is now.
good,"very difficult to make moves within the company"
good,Filed claims daily for AMEX card holders. Learned how to balance funds for the card holders daily. Learned about insurance for the card holders to complete the claims. Saved company money daily. Investigate claims in high detail to confirm each claim was legit. Enjoyed knowing that I helped customers with there issues. 
good,"Amex is a good place to work if you don't want to have a life. And forget about moving up in the company. The only way that will happen if you know somebody or the right person. They won't work with you if you next to change your schedule. The good thing about amex is that they will feed you lol, the benefits are really good. But make sure you keep a copy of every timesheet they will screw you over on your pay. Yes that means they still write down your time."
good,"I started in the Miami Lakes office of Business Travel, then transfered to an onsite office in New Jersey. I was a top performer earning many awards and additional responsibilities that I requested. The company brags they are names one of ""Best Places to Work for LGBT Equality according to the Human Rights Campaign, 2010."""
good,"Over all Its a decent organisation to work with , Its an organisation which works on its value no matter what the outcome will be ."
good,Approving credit for customer at point of sell
good,"The band system of titles and promotion is very out-dated. Once you are in a band, you will be in that band forever. However I have seen one or two exceptions: they moved up very quickly, very incompetent people but personally related to some one very high up in the management. Amex is an company of the pass, if you are good at what you do, don't waste time working for the Sydney management team, they are incompetent."
good,"Working place midst of KL heart (better use public transport). Since parking fee to high.  I have travel by car not able to for saving, environment are superb, Working in a group. Fun times alot"
good,"Management does not have your back, unless you are a top sales person. You have to know someone in oder to move up. Don't count on any help, management gets paid to tell you to ""de-escalate"""
good,"Multi Cultural company and smart colleagues"
good,"Begin early day working hard with massive data in the US trade and the entire globe in a typical day, managing platforms and monitoring all issues on those"
good,"Cafeteria was great, pay was great.  Culture was pretty bad and they laid off the whole department 6 months after hiring me (and a whole new class of fraud agents).  Severance was decent given the lack of tenure, but I didn't stick around to get it.  Left for a better opportunity after learning of coming layoff."
good,"The TL's (managers) are great but have little power to assist with any genuine concerns.  After working here a while, you will begin to feel like the corporate robot that you are.  Employee happiness and opinion don't truly matter to the upper echelons of management, though they will say this is otherwise.  Starting pay should be higher."
good,I worked as a contractor IT tech and the environment was good but the benefits and salary was really bad because the contractor company. The full employment have good benefits but the IT techs have no benefits or a good salary.
good,"Excellent company to work for but depending on the division you were actually hired, there was an unhealthy atmosphere. "
good,"Very cliquey. Male dominated. "
good,"American Express as a global name is a formidable organization.   Top notch leadership and value proposition.  It is however slow to change and bureaucratic .  Especially in our region, which was headed by someone from Latin America.   This leader ran the organization like his private organization.  As a whole, no one accepted criticism nor did they employ effective listening."
good,"La empresa como tal es excelente, la gente quien la maneja no tanto"
good,"Its an ok place to work.  Managers seem to be ever changing and large number of Female Managers here.   I'd say more Female than Males..  This is ok and no issue with but I think they sometimes overlook equally qualified Male candidates to keep the ""Diversity"" numbers up.."
good,"Too political.  "
good,"Did not have any training very disorganized lounge."
good,The company has good benefits but is full of unprofessional people. People have given the company a bad working culture. It’s very difficult to do your job when people don’t have respect.
good,"The job pays well"
good,"I spent most of my days in meetings and then had to work late to make up the work that did not get done because I was in meetings all day.  A lot of leadership changes are occurring at the company due to the recent change at CEO."
good,"Totally out of whack goals and management decisions and leadership all around. Outdated systems, who would believe that, no training for the systems either."
good,"The job is highly stressful, your schedule changes every 6 months base on the customer feedback. good feedback means you get to pick your schedule, a few bad reviews you get a bad schedule with the company"
good,Over abundance of Managers per workforce.  Not enough training and very low morale.  Would not recommend anyone to apply to this particular area of the company
good,American Express pays well. There are many good things about working for that company such as advancement and pay but management has a lot of improving to do in regards to the relationships with employees.
good,"American Express does a lot of displacements year over year. Top down management, very militant approach, you do as you are told mentality. One pro is work life balance, they do focus on employees and boosting morale"
good,Sold appointments to large corporations. They have been called many times by West Asdociates so that made it more difficult.  Comoensation was low for the stress and angst of trying to get to bonus.
good,"A Typical work day consists of helping card members plan and pay for business related and vacation trips for air, car rentals, hotels, and transfer transportation.  I learned enough to survive the clients who are entitled spoiled brats that expect you to do everything for them although they are obnoxious to you. Management has pets, and only they are richly rewarded.  Hectic most months and all day and the hardest part of the job are how much power is given to the card members since their surveys affect your shift, bonuses, and ability to move up or around and can even cost you the job itself.  The most enjoyable part of the job is speaking about something I love to do ""travel,"" and some of the card members are pleasant humans."
good,Calling profiles are overworked and hard to achieve targets to make incentives. Salary hike across IJP’s is less. Yearly increment is not performance driven rather personal driven as per the liking of the management
good,It was a great experience in spite of poor leadership and tremendous favoritism. I would recommend to anyone looking to get some financial industry experience.
good,"I was hired for the position of desktop support.  The job they tell me to do is manage ISPs for home-based employees.  This is a full-time responsibility suited for the skillset of a project manager.  When I pointed out that they were hiring technical people for management work-  under a completely different job title, I was told it would be too much work to change the job descriptions with the recruiters.  I am paid less than the part-time security guards.  I work for 2 contractors for some reason.  I get no benefits, no sick time, no holiday pay.  American Express believes I will work this way for 20 years."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of collections in a production based environment. It can be competitive or relaxed, depending on the day of the week."
good,"It would be a great job, if you can get past the requirements to get out of training. I wish I would have known my job relied on customers completing surveys,"
good,"AMEX is great company with a number of employees who have been there forever.  They are trying to make the necessary changes to remain competitive, but are always a few years behind.  "
good,"le cadre de travail  était  bien, mais le management  était stréssant, et les clients très difficile nous laissaient pas de temps de répi"
good,"Processed tickets and provided general support for travel agents. The workplace culture is very political  The hardest part of the job was getting management to promote a ticket processor to the next position,  I had taken this position as a foot into the industry, but as I had been advised, no one wants the Ticket Processor job, so when a company has one. they don't want to let you move forward.."
good,I don't fell like filling out any review at this time worked at this place too many yrs ago fn too remember. thank you and have a nice day. this is the end
good,"i wont refer anyone... but for people who can devote 10-12 hrs in office, for them American Express Hyderabad is good.. "
good,"Overall it's very good organisation to work with, except limited growth opportunity within company. During tenure of work here I learned my new skills and enjoying work here,"
good,No work life balance in development team. Every team member is very technically advanced. great place to develop skill set. No transparency in decision making from upper management.
good,This position was more of a call center position. In front of the computer all day while calling business owners. No place for advancement. Have to hit a certain mark everyday which is very reachable.
good,Good work culture and work-life balance. But lots of politics and partiality. Experienced managers are not up to the mark.Bases on the performance recognition is not given. Compensation and other benefits are poor
good,"While you will learn a lot on this job, management changes the rules"
good,"En el área se aprende mucho del negocio pues se esta en contacto tanto con clientes externos como internos, siendo fuente de información que retroalimenta a todo el proceso operativo de la empresa, sin duda, dinámica y a la vez compleja."
good,"It is what you make it. Don't value people as they should, people don't come first. The culture there is not that good as they just switched to a bluework type of enviornment. Right now they are reducing the contractors which make for way more work for the the full time employees. And we are expected to do the same amount of work."
good,"The company has gone down hill since departing from American Express. Less in benefits, and Management changes are going to cost the company in the end."
good,"American Express is a very well known company that offers plenty of opportunities to learn in marketing, business development, and various other business units."
good,"Training does not include how to properly service customers - more based on sales and how to make more money. "
good,I worked here for several years and there just didn't seem to be much room for advancement. Many times they hired from outside of the company instead of promoting internal employees.
good,"A typical day would be to respond to ticket cases physically within the call center whether it be a move of a workstation , add users/services/credentials ."
good,"Decent company to work for, but I did not like working in a call center.   The team managers were not really management material."
good,"American Express is know for a great work/life balance with the compromise being the compensation.  Given the state of the business for the past year and foreseeable future most teams are tasked with doing much more with less.  Therefore they lose the work/life balance perk and still pay 30-40% less than you would be getting paid for a similar role at any bank or network.  Constant re-orgs, job freezes, and layoffs which can be expected when you loose 30% of your card member base."
good,Bon relationnel avec les clients - Reporting régulier faisant progresser sur l'accueil client
good,"after 20 years, you have done a lot of different jobs. I was mostly customer service."
good,Pressure for some specific set of domains is intense. Depends on Team and profile. Outdated technologies are still existing. Need to move far ahead in terms of techology.
good,Great name and brand but not much room for growth and salary is low.  Customer service is stressful but can make a lot of money.  Company has changed over the last few years.
good,"My experience was a poor one that was 100% because of my manager...he has long since left the company."
good,"American Express is always evolving. New divisions being created while other departments are being eliminated causing major lay offs. Job security not too sure. "
good,I found this company is good in all segments. I learnt and enhance my skills here. All top management is supportive. It gives chances to make good relationships. Most importantly it cares their customers and employees.
good,was a nice overall experience learning about the American Express prepaid card culture
good,"A call centre environment with irate, unintelligent and rude customers calling everyday with not a second to breathe between calls for 8 hours straight and being underappreciated and underpaid"
good,"The day started with helping fellow associates get into their workstations and making sure they had access to their working drawer.  (each terminal had a certain opening time and had to be there to be sure it opened on time) communicated to shift leader for those associates who were late or covering for others.  Go through airport security (TSA agents) open all stations by 8am (some mornings I had to be at the airport at 4am to open at certain terminals) then call/ Instant message around to all stations making sure they had enough currencies in addition to United States Dollars.  Cross sell gift cards, travelers checks, balance working till, work up against the clock and people waiting for you to sell currencies (afternoon sales were huge) technology issues while using the network, computer crashes, not having enough currencies or US dollars, filling out Currency Transactions reports for certain transactions, copying passports for internal use, using a watch list and checking customers name to a data base."
good,"Nuestro día era ir a Barajas e intentar vender tarjetas de American Express a las personas que tuvieran la tarjeta de Iberia Plus, regalándoles 600 puntos (un vuelo gratis)."
good,"A Typical day includes brown nosing, and spending more time preparing your own visibility to the upper management"
good,"I have learned lot of things in American Express. People in american express are great to work with. Excellent bonding with co-workers, peers and customers. I have learned in true meaning how to provide excellent customer service. The hardest part of job was high volume of calls."
good,"-pas de possibilité d'évoluer"
good,The work environment back in 2000 was wonderful. The big changed caused a lot of insecurity and great teams to break up. Overall it is a wonderful company to work for.
good,"overall satisfied, however they can work on creating a better work environment for their employees."
good,"The SOC was a very nice place to work"
good,"Learning new technologies and fraud detection concepts . The most enjoyable part of the work is open interaction with a lot of people with diverse backgrounds , working on different things. "

good,New store opening AGM.
good,"A call center enviroment in the corporate travel industy, clents expect curtious, efficient and prompt service with a smile."
good,"Era comercial en Amex, y el sentimiento general es este : frustración. "
good,Working as a contractor at American Express was an interesting experience having never worked in the finance sector before. I learned that the company can be very slow to adopt change bit came round eventually
good,Good company to work for. Learned that managers are vastly different. Some managers are managers and others are leaders. Being flexible and adjusting to networking is key to your success
good,"Not a good place to work for promoting from within, no work/life balance, unexperienced management, compensation was $35 base plus commission and required to work 10 hour days without overtime pay."
good,"American Express hires Customer Care Professionals as service reps to assist customers with questions, however the job is very much a sales position. You are told that your performance is based on quality and knowledge of the products, but your sales metrics are weighted much heavier than any of those focused on quality. If you enjoy sales, this is a great role for you. If you are looking for a customer service job where you feel like a valued member of a team, this is not the job for you."
good,"American express is over all a good company to work for i used to work for Bangalore location not sure about Gurgaon but no facilities are provided in Bangalore, no food, transport is one way provided if your shift falls after 8pm -6am. No flexibility whatsoever regarding shift timings or breaks. Getting leaves are a very big problem. However,company has the best pay packapackage"
good,"There is a lot of learning but favoritism is a big issue in the company. So, if your team is great you will last longer here or get to finding a new team or a new company."
good,"Sometimes, it's just luck of the draw. AMEX is a great company. However, a great experience comes down to great leadership. One large piece of advice, DO NOT APPLY FOR A TRAVEL CONSULTANT POSITION. Management is terrible! They don't care about their people, just themselves."
good,American express was a very casual company but the work is a little stressful as most of the work were related to credit card payments and banking.  Management was good as they were willing to develop you.
good,"Builds you on a foundation of progression and a good work life. During training you a taught that this is probably the best job you will ever have and you are working for the best company in the world. Alarm bells ring when you are told you are never allowed to be 'negative' in the work place. Negativity gets reported and held against you. Feeling tired from late nights? Don't be negative. Customer becomes rude and aggressive and you get upset? Don't be negative. Need time off for an interview? Don't you dare think of leaving the company or you'll be black listed. Applied for more than 1 job internally? What don't you like your job? Black listed. "
good,Ils mettent beaucoup trop de pression sur les employés et licencie facilement.
good,"Great place to work if you are interested in traveling. Schedules are not family friendly, but it is work from home. Make sure that you have a quite area to be able to work from."
good,"Typically day put out escalation monitor work groups for escalations. Integrate new products into the ITSM platform,Try to convince other organizations to centralize to Service Now Platform even thought they have a tried and true tool set in operation"
good,There were a lot of cross training opportunities however the skills and experiences that were acquired would never be put to use because there weren't any internal job opportunities available.
good,Unable to successfully innovate in a competitive and crowded financial service industry.  Relies almost exclusively on previous profitable platforms and is primarily serving the East coast of the US.
good,"Très rare sont ce qui arrivent à obtenir un CDI."
good,Un producto elitista y que solo hay un sector de la población en México que realmente puede soportar los cotos de sus tarjetas y que es un sector muy reducido.
good,"Used to be the best place to work. Now its extremely stressful and might as well be called a sales position, because if you're not selling your job is in jeopardy. Management is now horrible and they write you up for any little thing. They are letting go left an right and hiring new people to fill their ""sales positions"". They do have Great benefits, but it doesn't compensate for you being on edge everyday and unsure if you will have a job or not because of the new requirements."
good,"Every year they outsource and lay off several people with no regard to tenure. They do value diversity, and the dress code is lax, but senior management is only concerned about themselves."
good,Its a good place to work which includes schedule to follow which is measured automatically resulting in your monthly payout. Friendly environment. Good experience.
good,"I liked many years there, but loss of stock value caused many drastic changes, cuts in benefits, low increases and a more cut throat environment.  Glad I left."
good,"taking payments"
good,Good place to start with in the fraud industry - Nice colleagues - But not many career advancement in the Accertify company - There is always over time which is good but we have to work one day in the weekend
good,"I worked for American Express for 6 years. I started with a Salary of 38000. After 6 years, I left making 40000. My reviews were consistently good, and met/exceeded requirements. I was never on counseling of any sort. Yet my yearly raises/bonuses did not reflect my performance. At Amex, it seemed to be about who you knew, and if you were considered a favorite, in order to be compensated for the work you did.  Management, over all, seemed to lack basic knowledge of GDS formats, and corporate account policies."
good,A good place to start a level-entry type career. Great employee recognition and incentive program but provided low salary. Management was approachable.
good,Workplace was like a battle field and all were fighting against each other to mark their place in the company it was a never ending race and the competition was cut throat and the whole atmosphere was filled with bitterness and envy.
good,"This is one company that likes to give back to its employees! They have a lounge for the employees to play video games, air hockey, and places to sit and talk on your cell. They also have a place to take yoga classes."
good,"Overall good place to work.  "
good,More often than not the goals of someone in another business unit impacted the policies and procedures of another business unit. Because of this and how bonuses were given it was difficult to succeed when you had to change your goals/projects mid stream.
good,"8 hours"
good,"There are so many good things to say about AMEX but what you need to know is that they will likely start you off as a contract employee and tell you that you will be hired on as an actual AMEX employee within a few months.  Then after a while you will be told that it might take a little longer than expected.  A few months later you will receive the same message, until you will be finally hired on or let go... well, you get the point.  This system works great for them and for the contractor agency, but leave you wondering if they are just stringing you along for as long as possible.  After all, you are motivated to work harder because you are definitely competing against all of the other contractors; they save a bunch of money because they don't have to pay you any benefits; and they can let you go at anytime for no reason at all.  It took me well over six months to get hired on as an FTE."
good,Es una empresa con fuerte desarrollo en innovacion tecnologica
good,"Too much hiearchies and bureucratic env due to which day to day work is not much productive."
good,"Working at Amex is nice however, the opportunity for growth is limited. You have to know someone many times and then if you get in they under pay you."
good,i did not get the training i needed to do the job but most other thing was ok with the people and staff but . some times i did not get the help i needed
good,"workplace culture was competitive but your fellow employees did help out, There were plenty of opportunities to get to know the other agents on a personal basis and a lot of get- togethers"
good,"Nepotism"
good,Enjoyed working with the team I was working with. Management have absolutely not a clue what is required and how we manage day to day work load. One of the poorest management team all around.
good,It's a great company. You get to work from home.  You have to be self-motivated because you work from home. The only negative thing I have to say about American Express is even though they say they have a good work/life balance they really don't.  You don't get a lot of different work hours to choose from and being fresh out of training you will get the late shift.  Also the training environment is not really good for the moral.  You have to graduate and if you don't pass at the end of the 3 months you don't move on.
good,Very intense training. Software was the best I ever used from any company I ever worked for. Very professional atmosphere. Management was easily approachable.
good,"it is a very stressful/fast pace enviroment to work in, my manager never heard my concern and didn't do enough to help me they don't value good workers mgmt always playing the hot potato game i felt that my mgr never really had my back."
good,An extremely demanding place to work but offers fantastic benefits and bonus scheme. Great location and facilities on site.
good,"The company has a lot of wonderful people to work with and you build incredible working relationships.  They have extensive consultative training classes and it develops each individual to be a more productive sales person,"
good,"AmEx is overall going down the drain. Management doesn't listen to employees. And the company was out of it's mind to not resign contract with Costco. That will be the death of the company, as evidenced by all the layoffs. Their compensation was just ok. Their insurance was the absolute worst I've ever had. It was a joke for a company that big to have such horrible insurance. Work life/balance was good."
good,Typical call center job where higher management doesn't care about the front line employees. The politically correct BS drove me insane. They monitor you from every which metric you can possibly imagine. They hold your attendance to the highest standard when the levels above you come and go as they please. Team Leaders will constantly just walk around and BS with each other. The security team of the building is a joke.
good,Good Company to work. Good Culture and Friendly environment. Management is very much helping. Cons is Amex fire employees and contractors very frequent without any clear justifications
good,"In Technologies I am sure there are less than 10% Americans working in the organization.  Move ahead is only due to your relationships and not your ability."
good,"Great benefits working for this company, management team very open and transparent. Lots of team functions, great benefits and pay."
good,"I was excited to start a new adventure with American Express in TCA."
good,A typical work day would include logging on the system taking inbound and outbound calls assisting customers whom were stopped at the point of sale for one reason or another. I learned different ways of bridging a customer and deescalating a tough call. My manager was a joke but there where some good managers there. The hardest part of my day is speaking to a customer who didn't  understand their card product. The most enjoyable part of my day is my coworkers and interacting with them daily.
good,"good place to work, good salary and benefits, no management and hr visibility at all, leave management is a serious matter of concern and constraint"
good,No job security. Advancement opportunities are slim/low. Good atmosphere. Cafeteria and Fitness center with game room.
good,"Company is struggling to cope with changing business environments, which include younger workforce and unprofitabble investments in previous years.  "
good,Typical call center work. Where you need to get the client on and off the call as quickly as possible then move on to the next call. While maintaining service levels and accuracy
good,"It's all about the ""base"".  Without the support from management, it's impossible to move forward within this company. Management rewards their friends, and overlook those workers that excel, and recognized by the clients they service."
good,"Finance is what I studied in college but once I started my profession as a certified financial consultant I realized that it was not what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. Therefore, I made the switch to education."
good,"I believe if you take up a job offer you should at least like something about the job. The managers and employers that worked here just seemed as if they had no care. Although I am one voice, its takes more than just one to get a point across. To all American Express employees, please come to work and do your job as if its the last day on earth. The energy and motivation you put towards something is the effect you will get back."
good,Working at American Express opens the door to one who doesn't know what field they want to work in. The company is open minded in allowing for example someone from finance to try a marketing role.
good,Typical day was answering phones and trying to sell someone insurance policies for being an American Express card member.  Didn't have an opportunity to advance as the company moved out of the state of Wisconsin.
good,"Amex isn't about what you know or how hard you work or how ""great you are."" It's all about the relationships you build with upper management.  If you aren't in the ""clique,"" it's a lot harder for you to move up..."
good,I was a temp employee here just before my last surgery it was nice.
good,"The web development area was extremely dependent upon the quality of lower managers. We lost some very good people, and the inexperienced, inept characters who replaced them made the place go belly up. The two main magazines both lost their community sub-sites, and many of the special pages built during the previous few years are broken. Nearly everyone who worked there in 2011 is gone now."
good,"I have been working for 29years in corporate travel industry.  I make worldwide reservations for air, cars, hotels and limos.  I am at a virtual at home schedule.  I am very independant and self sufficiant.  I am looking to expand in other career opportunities."
good,Great company that provides the perfect balance for those who have families and those who are attending school.
good,"I took this contract role on as AMEX was the only place to work in Brighton.  It was highly pressurised as compliance was strict.  I learn't a lot from a fantastic training course.  I would say my co-workers were indifferent.  The hardest part of the job was flicking through hundreds of screens and a taking 10 minutes to sign into the system, the work was mundane and not at all challenging"
good,Coaching from some supervisors was excellent. Other tended not to want to assist when they were needed. The training was great.
good,"A typical day consists of arriving at my desk early before the start of day at 9am to get things in order before being bombarded by various teams for requests to be fulfilled. Working parallel with the market in terms of currency cutoff times and rates, my team and I work diligently to ensure client's and their payments are processed accordingly. We test and work with our internal systems to make sure daily processes run smoothly. However, with the overwhelming amount of work and pressure put on us, we feel undervalued, underappreciated, and greatly overlooked by the rest of the department as well as the leaders. The most enjoyable part of my day is glancing at the time in wondrous realization that the market will soon be closing and we may have a bit of sanity afterwards. An average day concludes at about 6pm. Through all the pessimism, I have come to acknowledge that I've gained some experience and knowledge in terms of foregin exchange and the process and methods it takes to send a payment internationally. I've expanded my skills in Microsoft Office independently, learned a new software such as Salesforce, and given the ability to work alongside JPM and Citibank."
good,"Good culture, lifestyle company. Leader in payments industry."
good,"I've been with Amex for almost 8 years. For the last 4-5 years, the work environment has become increasingly stressful. I've seen several co-workers be walked out due to not reaching the required numbers, yet they were excellent customer service reps, some being employed there for 20+ years. I know my day will come, no matter how hard I work. Amex used to treat their employees as a valued part of the business, but not anymore. It's a numbers driven business. Personally speaking, I would be a much harder worker if I didn't have constant worries about how to deal with unfair treatment and policies and procedures that don't make sense. The daily system issues are so frustrating to deal with, and the customers are upset over a website that isn't working, and then they give the employee a bad survey for it when it wasn't our fault. If you get too many of those surveys, you'll be walked out. Over the years, I have learned how to deliver a difficult message to customers, and have gained a lot of knowledge of security awareness training, relationship care and the like, that I will take with me wherever I go. Amex has spent thousands of dollars to train me, yet they will no longer benefit from that because of the way they treat their employees. Hopefully, I use my job talents that Amex paid for at another company that appreciates their employees. Lastly, I am pretty sure that I will be terminated when I go into work tomorrow, and I suspect that it's from using FMLA, but they'll call it something else. I will miss my co-workers, but they'll be along shortly. Those former co-workers that"
good,Too much dependency on outsourcing and no clear strategic vision on implementing technical growth road map.
good,good paY.great ambience.hardest part is the sale of credit card with annual card when you know you may get the same card free of charge from other known brands
good,Moving from New York to Florida was a huge adjustment for me. I learned how to adapt to change and understand the business perceptive. I learned how to become better at multi tasking and develop people along the way. My strong points was being able to work in an environment with team chemistry and perceptive to change
good,"non possibilità di carriera per contratto determinato"
good,"American Express cares about it's employees and gives great benefits. The company has good values and strives for perfection. I learned to constantly action feedback and continually improve performance. I enjoyed my coworkers however I really didn't know them very well as my job was to be on the phones the entire time. The hardest part of the job is hours, it is a 24/7 company and they end up needing a lot of weekend and late night shifts. and even if you get an okay shift it is probably going to change before the end of the year."
good,Starts with Follow ups
good,"Arrive at work 6:30 A.M., sign on to salesforce, email, intranet, and hoovers. Review emails for can't wait issues, pull up lead load and make cold calls till noon. Send out presentations and applications. Check in sysem for the amount of spend my existing clients are charging and call clients that are not preforming at the dollar amount that was agreed upon. Submit any incoming applications, notify new clients of the limit their company recieved, have them hold invoices for payment, and issue cards. Submit my companies that have already booked the first dollar and the annual projected charge volume, to my manager. Make sure my desktop is organized and my calls are completed before I leave for the day. Leave from 2:30 -4:00."
good,It was an experience that allowed me to work from home as part of a Pilot team assisting card members with their needs. The most difficult part was assisting card members to the fullest in the smallest amount of time alotted. Keeping with in a 2 minute window per call. Impossible to do when callers have several issues to be adressed.
good,"Actuellement employée en tant qu'agent de voyages (d'affaires) au sein de l'entreprise American Express Voyages d'Affaires, je souhaiterai changer de domaine d'activité, en particulier dans l'assistanat."
good,"High stress envoirment, focused on Relationship Care. Fair pay incentives, managment encourages little games throughout the day to increase moral. Mangement give bbq and other meals to show their appreciation for our work"
good,"It's okay, It pays the bills. Long tenure. Benefits are good."
good,Worked here for a very brief period of time. Position phased out.
good,un día cómodo en el trabajo y un ambiente laboral ameno
good,"Good company to work for but management wasn't very great. The culture isn't that great either, but the pay is good. It's not too bad if you really enjoy the call center environment."
good,not at liberty to say.  I don't want to really give a review on the company.  I think that if you don't nothing good to say then don't say another at all
good,If you can find a good leader then you will enjoy the company.  Good leaders are few and far between.  Being with the company for quite some time the purpose of the position changed from being customer based to just needing to sell and focus only on the sales.
good,"Opportunity for advancement, but you've got to drink the Kool-Aid. Benefits start after 3 months, robust training but lots of help to get you to graduation if needed."
good,"There are a lot of contractors in the my department, about 50%.  A bit of an odd us/them culture.  Still quite a ways to go before they are actually 'agile'."
good,Management ignores you till you get upset enough to quit and now here are one hundred fifty characters to reach the minimum almost there any minute now
good,"poste extrêmement instable. notion de concurrence permanenta entre les vendeur, prime peut élever pour les performance requise pour le poste"
good,"If you can get the job  . Do it , shut your mouth , hit those numbers and you will be ok . The work culture is not how they make it seem . For ppl of color. Just always be aware of your executive presence"
good,"Productive workplace, but no part time positions available. Great location. Great benefits as well as 401K and AWESOME vacation time. Pay was average."
good,"The culture used to be great at the company.  Good team effort, friendly people and fun work.  Now the company is so focused on getting and retaining younger workers it has created a youth centered culture where older workers are made to feel out of place and not valued."
good,My experience with American Express is that senior leaders would move the whole organization to support some new initiative and then abandon those efforts in 6 months. This was a frustrating part along with leaders not being enabled to truly lead. Decisions at the company are made at the top and forms a strong conforming tendency on all levels of leadership. This drove me to understand how a larger organization can value innovation and employee contributions and why under-valuing occurs.
good,"1 negative survey takes about 10 positive surveys to overcome, and surveys hinder bonuses. The negative survey may show that you provided all they needed and more, but someone else gave terrible service and the card member complains and scores low on yours- but there's no consideration."
good,"log in and take calls until break or lunch , view emails , speak with upset customers , book and modify reservations , take payments and call airline for corrections ."
good,"the Salary was fair, My favorite part was their cafe. It was amazing. "
good,Inclusive appearance. Training mediocre. Praise you when you're good. Treat you like you dont exist when you get bad surveys. RTF/surveys leaves you feeling inadequate if its bad. Its not good for staff morale. Feels like youre walking on egg shells. Building and surroundings are aesthitcally pleasing but your heart bleeds.
good,No clear direction from management.  Harder to advance in your position and not all departments will give you tuition reimbursement even though American Express advocates if you work for American Express they offer tuition reimbursement.
good,"again lots of competition you had to out work,think,and out smart your competitiors .  zI love the trill of the kill.  Always good to earn a win.  Why we do it !!!"
good,"American Express has a very aggressive business model. When I was there they had recently announced the separation of Costco from American Express. That meant sell, sell, sell no matter what. At times with the majority of the customers on the phone in so much debt because of losing a job or the collapse of their business. Our jobs were dangled in front of us like carrots to a rabbit, if we didn't consult or offer. Of course money could be made there but you have to have a hustler mentality, which means by any means necessary. It wasn't the right company for me."
good,"American Express really does care about providing great benefits to its employees. WIth that said; it is frowned upon to use them. If you are in a sales role like this, you still have to make up your goal and if the team is behind, your teams goal, and if the directorate is behind, then the directorates goal. If you can take the grind it is a good opportunity!"
good,Sueldos competitivos en relación a otras empresas.
good,they have job security and a professional management. they provide health benefits and they provide sick days and vacation pay. However it is not easy to get a raise. They do not have good incentives or realistic quotas that are acheivable.
good,"Our team had smart and talented members, but the decisions made at the top seem to work against the company. AMEX hires too many contractors, which in turn reduces company knowledge."
good,"American Express is a high stress environment with the expectation of working insane hours to keep up with global customers.  While I loved the people there and the work was exciting, I didn't like working at 4 am and 10 pm.  Nor did I like working to bring about change only to be given a poor rating from a supervisor who wanted to make himself look good."
good,"The training is lacking at best, and the people you deal with on the phone expect everything for nothing, the clientele is the pinnacle of the rich get richer"
good,I learned a lot about the credit card and finance industry. I met great people and was given great benefits. I was given many opportunities within the company to learn other areas of the business.
good,"Training needs to be better organized.  Training is to rushed."
good,Modern technologies and ability to work from home. The company follows good values and offers a good work life balance. There's many domains within this company in which you can move around and expose yourself to.
good,The culture is geared to entry level young people. Salary is extremely low and bonus structures almost impossible to achieve. Great opportunity to obtain insurance licenses.
good,Very good work/life balance.  Not as stable work environment as it has been in the past.  Good benefits such as PTO and others.  Good work environment and good diversity.
good,"The fact that American Express has many lines of business - allows their workforce to move within the organization in order to continue to grow.  "
good,"Great place to work, but ultimately depends on your team's leader for better job prospect and possibility to achieve beyond what you can offer. The company does not have an in-house HR team, so it makes it difficult to get HR related help if not from direct team leader."
good,"The company is amazing when it comes to female employee security and other benefits."
good,Ok place to work.  Job security and advancement opportunity are poor.  A lot of busy work in field.  Hardest part of job was terrirtory size.  Most enjoyable was being able to work from home.
good,"There's upward mobility if you are an analyst and above.  It's hard to obtain a promotion when you are in a lower position.  Also, the performance review isn't always fair, but otherwise it's a great company."
good,"WFH is a definite plus"
good,"Workplace culture is very New York, much more task than people  orientated.  Think I priced myself out of the market here, with International help being more affordable for them. They are a forward thinking company which finds other ways to compete than on the cost of their product."
good,"The company today (2007) is very different from years ago. The company lost very large accounts (i.e: COSTCO), which caused a huge impact overall. To keep Wall Street investors happy the company keeps cutting costs (lay offs) and limiting/eliminating investments. Leadership, Innovation, Cooperation are words loosely used in the company but not easy to find. The CEO used to be one of the best available but after many years he is showing lack of energy and does not provide direction as expected. This problem cascades to all lower levels of the Org Chart. People are so afraid of losing their jobs that you now see ""Cheerleading"" behaviors for all non-sense any Director/VP proposes. Most which go nowhere. Very knowledgeable resources are being let-go an not replaced. Very tough to find someone who still knows the Business, Process and Tools (internal). This is a sad period for a 167 year old company."
good,"Not flexible on work schedule and breaks.  They use to have a small turn over and be a great company to work for, they now have a large turnover and layoffs."
good,"Good company - Work life balance is reasonable.  Great PTO policy.  Leaders are generally trying to do the right thing.  Company needs to find new revenue streams,"
good,"Laid back easy going culture, friendly management difficult to get time off when needed. If working on the weekend hard to get a day off team outings are usually lots of fun, learn how to handle difficult situation, moving up is not easy, usually when they cannot find anyone one to fill in difficult to fill position they would send out to the notice of open position. Not the easiest place to move up."
good,I have enjoyed a long career at American Express and therefore would find it difficult not to recommend them.  On the whole a great company to work for but as always under the right leadership and in the right team.  As the company downsizes the culture is changing.
good,"all the benefits are for customers and cost cutting is by cutting benefits of employees. From day 1 i saw benefits for employee,being cut and no reason credits were given to cm."
good,"The management was lacking for the actual company I worked for PRC, the base was low though. But the actual company American Express was actually a nice company to work with."
good,"Empresa que ofrece buen suedo base y prestaciones bastante atractivas como: seguro de gastos medicos mayores, seguro dental, gasolina y vales de despensa, caja de ahorro, entre otros. Es una empresa que me formo, de la cual estoy muy agradecida. Deseo crecer y lograr un equilibrio entre mi vida personal y el trabajo, lo cual en este momento es dificil lograr en american express."
good,They are a Global Diverse company.  I was given the chance to learn alot. I also got a nice compensation package once I was being deployed
good,".Very regimented culture is very negative, work life balance is lacking, Very long hours and having to deal with other regions of the world"
good,"Scope to learn work is good,But they are more like a service based than a product-based,Also they pay less salary and no scope for  promotions"
good,"They always say they like diversity there, and they do to an extent. However, they don't approve of diversity in personality or opinion and if you demonstrate either, you will not advance."
good,Great organization. They really have the work at home segment nailed down. Training could use a bit more consistency and more mentoring time would be beneficial. Especially in the live-call listening. Overall the experience and culture is inclusive. One does not feel like a number in this vastly huge company.
good,"This is a typical fast paced sales environment. There are plenty of perks working for a large corporation as AMEX. A typical day is cold calling small business owners, 100 plus calls a day. The commissions are paid out every three months which is tough."
good,"Good place to learn payment industry and credit card. "
good,"yes, they pay a lot due to the fact that all of the employees are require to render OTs (quota of 50 or more hours per cutoff) which I find suicidal. With this kind of order, positively, an employee could get more or less Php50000 per cut-off but not a good reason to stay if it eats all your time to be with your family an love ones since they company won't let you go out of the office unless the required OT was met"
good,Customer Service and resolution of issues are the best at AMEX. The most enjoyable part is working with internal and external customers to promote and facilitate AMEX.
good,"okay to work for, wage is higher than most call centres.  Training is a bit short for the amount of work needed.  Must take good notes in training.  Also training class too big to really absorb information."
good,"with the recent reduction in force, the atmosphere has changed. It used to be an exciting place for new tech and innovative thought."
good,Advancement is promised as an option available to most however it isn't. Job tasks are highly repetitive. Management support is basically up to the individual who is directly managing. Management doesn't support employees.
good,Typical Customer service job with numbers to reach .  Would have like more opportunity of advancement . Lot of pressure for a customer service skill.
good,"The company is very interested in each employee expanding their knowledge and abilities, which is good because there are frequent layoffs, and employees may need to hop to other roles in order to stay with the company."
good,American Express Travel has downsized the Piscataway office to a fraction of the previous staffing. Current staffing is up to nine people from several hundred employees.
good,"-Great Coworkers and environment"
good,Typical day on the job is being plugged into a phone for 8 hours with barely any time for lunch.  Managers who care more about getting that next call more than their employees needs.  Virtually impossible to get the days off you need or want.
good,"Amex is always looking to the future for where their products and services should be, reading the environment and social trends that impact the ""payment space""."
good,"Spent many years at American Express, however the annual ' layoff' procedure got old.  Great products, great people, however the layoffs every year made the employees skittish."
good,This role is for individuals that are great salespeople and are self driven.  It is geared for entrepreneurs. Not much support and not much of a team environment
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was that I had the entire freedom to handle my accounts . And I was not restricted to arrange a call with the internal customers in case of any mismatch found in the accounts . Co-workers irrespective of their designations were always free to help us grow  and learn in our job on a continuous basis . The hardest part of the job was to deal with the internal auditors in middle of the daily-tasks such as attending calls/ mails and the regular analysis involved in accounts reconciliation . I would state this as the most thrilling part of the job as well. I have learned about the relevance of self-marketing in order to make oneself visible in the entire team . My day at Amex generally starts off with a general catch with the colleagues over a cup of coffee and the day proceeds with some training, analysis, meeting with the auditors and also by managing the mail box side-by-side ."
good,"Una volta era una bella azienda....ora sono cambiate un bel pò di cose, e il dipendente non è più considerato come prima....non vedo roseo il futuro nemmeno per loro.."
good,"Company has good work life balance"
good,A typical day for me is coming to work and counting tons of money. I love the fact that I am able to determing currencies from all over the world. Its also a learning experience when customers tell you about there experience from different companies. Very fun place of work.
good,"llegar a mi reunion , hacer citas llenar solicitudes y pasar por los papeles abrir empresas y ponerme con stands en empresas y asi es siempre mas o menos .."
good,"I like my actual job. I'm exceptionally good at it. I'm surrounded by peers who are not as dedicated then complain about their performance ranking. My relationship with my direct leader has been rocky. He came to us externally and didn't embrace the American Express culture (customers come first, a leader needs to lead and coach, you need to treat your team with respect, etc). A year later, improvement has been made, but that came after several discussions with his manager. He still doesn't coach, and it seems the department has no real grasp on what performance coaching is. I dedicated most of my American Express tenure coaching in a very fast-paced call center, in some way enhancing my teams' performance every minute of every day. On top of that, there's always the fear that our jobs with be outsourced, since we are a global company."
good,"Call center  in bound / out bound , advise  member  credit change , payment fraud , close  account ."
good,A typical day at work was busy and professional. What I learned about American Express is the importance of the  business aspect of employment. My manager was very professional and helpful. My co-workers were team orientated. The hardest part of my job was the stress of the year end deadline. The most enjoyable part of my job was being successful in completing a account.
good,"American Express is definitely a fast paced ever changing work environment.  While the company provides great benefits, be ready to change your schedule every six months.  Also, no one is exempt from the possibility of their job being moved over seas. "
good,"I have been a loyal Amex employee for 16 years mostly working within the corporate travel division. Within this time I have taken many steps to advance my career including utilizing the tuition reimbursement program to complete my BS degree in Business/HR as well as mentoring within Work force management and HR. Yet I have been turned down for the last 12 internal postings that I have applied for in the last couple years. I can tell from the types of questions which I received within these interviews that my length of tenure is actually part of the problem, as this seems to be viewed as a detriment and not a positive quality. For example, I was actually asked recently when I had a 2nd interview for a band 25 Account Protections Specialist position within the Fraud department ""about how much PTO time do have remaining for this year?"" After I told him that like other Amex employees with more than 10 years I have 264 hours per year. I was then actually asked if I believed my extensive PTO time would interfere with my ability to complete the training process.  I told him that No I did not believe it would interfere as with 16 years I would not set myself up to fail within this department and also told him that I was very flexible with my remaining PTO time. Ultimately I was turned down even though I have excellent work record, many transferable skills, and was very successful within my B.S. Business program.  "
good,"Fast paced call center environment for Fortune 500 companies, providing exceptional customer service for the business traveler. Objectives clearly defined for each account. Management recognition for exceptional job performance. Diversity embraced among peers. Most challenging to find a hotel available for conference during high season in a specific region. Quality first over quantity on every call."
good,I wasn't there long enough to know if it was a good place to work
good,"Genuinely good people are your coworkers if you don't seek for promotions. They can be friends after work. However, if you are more advanced in your career, the friendship changes. Also they like to promote within the company, however they don't offer money comparing to external when promote the people. (another reason they like promotion within???)"
good,"A American Express, foi uma escola, pois foi onde aprendi a trabalhar, há dez anos atrás, com vendas interna e externa, visitas a clientes,ter discernimento no trabalho.Gosto muito do que faço atualmente, não me vejo em outra aréa que não seja comercial. Trabalhar em visitas a empresas e clientes é  que mais gosto de fazer, hoje tenho uma gestora que nos auxilia bastante, no nosso dia-a-dia, Me identifico bastante com trabalho em equipe, hoje trabalho com uma média de 40 consultores."
good,"Although a relatively okay job, I fear that there is no place for advancement.  Every time I try to apply for another position, I keep getting turned down, and every time it is a different excuse.  I need a career not just a job."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that i helped someone
good,"They let me go because I didn't meet their numbers within the 15 week training program. The numbers they wanted me to meet were based on customers surveys about me. If a customer completed the survey incorrectly-it counted-regardless of how the customer REALLY felt. AMEX won't let me credit a late fee, survey is the bad and it's all on me and MY FAULT."
good,I got sick on the job so I did not meet the standards of management there. It was difficult for me because the rules of an agency are different from the rules of a major airline. I had come from a major airline so there was difficulty in me changing my way of thinking after being with a major airline and getting used to their ways for ten years.
good,"Balanced spreadsheets, reports."
good,Responsibilities Included:
good,Each day was very much the same with a lot of monotony. I learned how to process credit card applications. Co-workers were a blast to work with. The hardest part of the job was that it was very boring at times.
good,"I very much enjoyed the hard work that I put in with this, and in hopes for a career. Turn-Over was high, the training was great I have to admit, long and intence, but I am the type of person who wants to learn and exceed at everything I do. I was able to obtain many certifications and always strived to do better. Hardest part of the job, allot of people did not take it serious, when there was no management around it was like being back in high school. And allot of people did not want to be there."
good,A great place to work. Place to grow and learn.
good,"My job at the AEBL was through a direct sales agency named ""My Finance"" in the city.The job involved getting prospective clients,completing procedure for their loan disbursement and to run between the Central Processing Agency,the Regional Marketing Centre and the main bank American Express Bank Ltd. to get their profile verified with the successful disbursement of loans.A good place to get good incentives."
good,"Es una excelente empresa porque tiene muy buenas prestaciones aparte de las de la Ley; sin embargo el ambiente no es muy relajado que digamos, es algo tenso por la presión que tienen que ejercer para lograr las metas en las ventas de las tarjetas."
good,They were kind of unprofessional didn’t really tell us much information on questions we had as employees and it made the job harder. I think for the work we did they should’ve paid more
good,"I worked for Amex in a variety of roles over about 15 years. A few times, I had a really great manager who supported me and helped me grow. I owe a lot of my career to Amex, but I definitely would never want to return."
good,"Very busy work environment with high sales goals and expectations from Management. Typical days require constant interaction with customers and the expectation is always provide service and sell products. The environment is friendliest to sales oriented people, otherwise you will feel somewhat pressured. Aside from that the office is usually a large and diverse group of people who are friendly and good to work with."
good,Able to expose to various system. Good colleagues that able to guide you through all the training and introduce you on the system. Being impressed by their system because this was my first job.
good,"American express is a good place to work. specially for the moms. very flexible working hours. no micro management. also it depends on, in which team you work"
good,"Being on the front line of the business spectrum, this job is extremely stressful, dealing with unhappy clients, that scream and cuss and give you bad rating on surveys, consist changes with metrics which are being raise so high its almost impossible to maintain and no work life balance can take a toll of your mental well being."
good,Great place to work at and grow professionally. Lots of great people and amazing colleagues. Lots of room for improvement and to learn new topics on a regular basis.
good,"Enjoyed working there. Everyone was respectful of each other and always willing to help with issues to get resolved as soon as possible. No micro management, allowed you to do your job and make your own decisions of what you thought best, but always someone willing to assist if needed"
good,It's a great place to work.  It has amazing benefits.  The company itself is a great company but the levels of stress are superior to anything in life.
good,I manage communications and colleague engagement for 250 employees within the Fraud department. I also have 23 years of leadership experience and work in a face paced work environment.
good,"I am Corp. Travel Agent that requested me to book air , hotel and car. As well as taking care of problem .With delay and cancel flights through the world. Also taking care of changes in all."
good,"Call out to customers to try and collect on the unpaid debt."
good,"Good Work culture with new technologies. Fun place to work at AMEX, good colleagues and new projects. Hectic work with no work life balance. Fun place to work ."
good,"Cons:"
good,"good company. was there for nearly 14 years and in that time was very successful, securing multiple promotions and awards for performance both as an individual contributor and as a leader"
good,"I was hired into the Platinum Travel Counselor role, and had previous experience in finance related roles, though travel experience was not required nor did I have any. For the amount of training you do (which is quite extensive) having to learn all current bank holding regulatory laws and company privacy practices and then adding on the additional training for travel agents and the industry's regulations, requirements etc is so much to learn. Even with 12 weeks or so of training it didn't feel like enough (and that was the general consensus of those in my training group that actually HAD prior travel industry experience, I was the only one new to the travel industry entirely) - we were flying blind on calls booking travel that could easily run $20K on a normal call with Platinum Card Members - the company specific Sabre based GDS software (Encore) was constantly buggy and laggy which made finding and booking flights where prices change by the click an absolute nightmare. The deal breaker for me was when the position went from having no sales quota requirements when I accepted the position ... to becoming sales based as part of the performance metric to not only earn incentive but to even be meeting expectations that were not initially part of the job just months prior. Throwing someone with no travel into the travel industry is one thing - but when you advertise a position as non-sales based and then change your position requirements months later and base their pay and performance on that specific metric - that is too much for a new hire. Pay was great but still not worth the"
good,"We were in teams and had a close working relationship. We had company dinners and employee outing, as well as group, get-togethers for dinner with members of our families."
good,"Amex is a good place to start your career, to gain solid experience. But unfortunately has issues with management, which can make day-to-day work a pain."
good,"They seem to look after their staff and show genuine interest in guiding you and helping you along. Pretty much completely customer service focused (your bonus depends entirely on customer feedback) and it's a call centre environment that's not for everyone, but generally they have a good thing going."
good,Good place to work .it was nice working in AMEX. work culture s good and also the directors are so helpful. people are always helpful they are very much cooperatibe
good,"Slower paced dispatch, seems like they take loads out to somewhere, with out thought of load out of that area, so lots of layover time waiting for a load"
good,"Good place to work, only problems are it's understaffed, as well as not much direction in training. Your just thrown in to the job and wing it. The pay was ok, but the paid days off were the best."
good,"The job was fine, lot of learning and great for someone new"
good,"to much competition between out sourcing companies, will use who ever is cheaper on the day very short sighted. was there 4 months and then was replaced by some one from a different out sourcer that was cheaper"
good,"It was a very competitive stressful job.  There were a ton of bench marks you were expect to meet. There were benefits, salary, health insurance, 401k"
good,The job is challenging at times but I enjoy being able to assist others on a daily basis with their overall experience with our company. No job is perfect so I make the best of it every day.
good,"8 - 5 work"
good,Subcontracted would have been a great to work directly for American Express.  At times the training did not meet the standards of a professional commercial business.
good,I was only able to work in American Express as a contractor.  They kept me until I had to find a job when my 2 yrs was coming up.  It was a good experience but did not help my professional development.
good,I do not wish to review the company at this time.  The department I was in is no longer active at American Express.  Please see other former employee's for a review.
good,"Mes débuts dans le transport "
good,My experience was very different than other employees from other departments within the Travel Service. My department no longer exists and it is no longer important to provide my input.
good,No review to be had.  This business sector was sold off to a bigger company and is no longer around.  Enjoyed my time there as it provided with me with my first opportunity to be an analyst.
good,Was great for younger days with no kids. Travled a lot for work and fun. Changing industry to internet made it very risky to pursue as career. It is a good place for young crowd
good,"Amex is known for its good culture, very different than most corporate companies that I've worked for.  People are generally nice though it tends to be that passive-aggressive nice you get with some super A-type people.  "
good,American Express is a multi-company environment that expects the employees to multi-task and deal with various companies at one time.   This leads to less interpersonal relationships and less customer service experiences.
good,Typical big corporation mentality. Very narrow and structured tasks. Great colleagues and everything is sorted as law requires. Slow career progression.
good,"American Express was a okay place to work,  people were nice, but there wasn't really enough work so it was hard to keep yourself busy.  Not sure if they were afraid to give me more difficult tasks or what,"
good,Working with American Express was a good experience; however the kind of work I was doing was not suited to my experience. My experience was based in security; However this was more of a phone rep and customer service role..
good,"Will get you fully emersed in all aspects of the travel industry."
good,"I've worked there for 11 years only because of the flexibility. The management is poor, and the teams are toxic. It's dog eat dog and the management will throw you under the bus to make themselves look great!"
good,"Training was 6 weeks in class and 7 weeks on the job training with floor walkers to assist with any difficult calls."
good,"Amex is great in many ways, good pay and nice management but extremely unsociable hours and sometimes unreachable targets.  Very stressful sometimes as the customer is “always right” even if they speak to you like dirt. High expectations with phone call times and strict on time management. Overall can be great for the right type of person!"
good,I was handcuffed to a phone and was never promoted because I did not kiss anyones like youre suppose at every company so here I am looking for another one
good,"Cutting costs, by closing down American job sites and sending customer service overseas. American Express used to be the best of the best, their commitment to quality has been severely compromised."
good,This company is no longerin business. However it was good company to work for. Great place to start career. The work was intense and challenging. American Expresstaught me a lot about teamwork and collaboration
good,This was an entry level position and I was not their long enough to have any comments on the company. While I was there the management and staff were nice and friendly.
good,The division that I was in taught me a lot about the merchant lending industry. There appeared to be minimal opportunity for advancement although the idea of it was always mentioned.
good,"Empresa normal, dentro  del sistema financiero, en la actualidad los  sistemas financiero están mas competitivos y con mayores atributo, le faltaría estos a amex"
good,"Whats there to say you go to work to take calls from people that feel entitled.  If you work in customer service.  "
good,I do not want to write anything.  This is not a place that I want to give any information on the current employer.  I am not interested in providing any information.
good,I enjoyed the customer service contact.  The interesting overseas trips the customers had and learning and gaining knowledge from their experiences.  Welcoming and acknowledging return customers.
good,not at all a great place to work too much stress less pay no proper management  too much stress long hours and less pay . there are better company outside
good,"- Relaxed work environment"
good,There for 10 years and once they started going to surveys the company mindset changed and things started going down hill and people started losing jobs.  Started relying too heavily on surveys and were holding people accountable for things they had no control over.
good,"I loved working there.I loved my job. It was a dream job. The problem was some managers was dishonest, lazy and cut throat. They only looking to get paid. They care less on how the IT department is run. It's a shame, because it's a great company with hard working people to be lead by incompetent managers. Other then that I loved working there. I would do it again if I could."
good,"Team building atmosphere- able to work remotely-"
good,Very employee engaged.  Many opportunities.  The awesome part was the lunch room.  Very cheap and good food!  I loved eating at my desk and enjoying the many perks!
good,call center for american express rewards program. multi line phone system and multi screen computer systems. fun people but can be a stressful time if you let it be!
good,"received multiple calls most the call were upset customers that need it   a problem  resolved in a timely matter."
good,"I was here a week at aged 14.  I don't know.  I just got showed how a few of the departments within the company worked, and while I was there I did a little bit of research."
good,They still have a lot to figure out in this position to be honest. The work environment is outdated the process and procedures are out dated and the metrics are unrealistic and contradicting.
good,"The job was at a Contact Center, outsourcing.  The contracted ended and the company that's I worked for, decided not to renew the contact. My job was transferred to another company."
good,"Stressful job, longer hours than other.  Schedules not very flexible for family and can change at any time.  Great benefits and tools to help you succeed."
good,"Just  after the  school days  and  stepping  in to  see  how  Job  looks like and  what  it  means ,  very much  struggled  to  adopt the  corporate  culture  , Things  went  on  so  quickly  ."
good,I enjoyed working at AMEX.  They have since made major changes in their business model after losing the costco account.  I do not forsee myself working there again
good,"I worked as a contractor there and the place was decent compared to other places i have worked and supported.  At times it did feel like high school having to tell team members when your stepping out of the office just to get some water or use the bathroom.  sadly, there is no room at all for permanent placement or to even grow there."
good,"Buena calidad humana"
good,It was very stressful working conditions. It was a typical call enter environment. It was good pay however the office politics were something I didn't enjoy.
good,"Competitive pay and benefits. Hard to integrate into the culture of the client. Unstable direction, but good platform to start and move on from during your career."
good,"Wide open work environment and loud. I would take calls all day, never a dull moment. Enjoyed working for the company and would work for them again, anytime."
good,"Worked for 8 years, overall good, made good friends. Good pension and some benefits. Got to travel to different countries for work experience.  Enjoyed my time there."
good,Had to do sales. which was a good learning experience during studying. Challenging job with flexible working hours made it easy to work and study together
good,"lavorando in Amex ho avuto modo di conoscere una nuova realtà, come funzionano le grandi aziende. Ho migliorato le mie conoscenze in merito alla lingua inglese."
good,Geen enkele problemen gehad totdat er veranderingen binnen het bedrijf kwam waardoor men de power heeft gekregen om mensen weg te sturen.
good,"Unless you're hired on as a permanent employee, you are cut out of nearly all development opportunities. The company culture has declined in the last decade. As more millenials enter the workplace, there is less formality and adherence to social norms that keep the Amex culture supportive for all. After working there for several years as a contractor, despite solid work and great relationships, I was not able to convert to full time (Its extremely competitive so connections + friendships matter much more than skills!). Unfortunately, some of the disengaged managers take no real interest in your career development since you are not ""a real employee"" -- a disappointing change from the way the company used to be."
good,"The company provides great work-life balance for its employees. Almost everybody works remotely on Friday. My managers were all very flexible when I needed to take time for personal matters."
good,"I didn't  stay long because company closed down , management was really helpful  want you to be comfortable , learn a lot , was very fast paced environment"
good,"American Express is a great place to work if you are a developer. If you have the skills and abilities to change the business and improve profit, you will do great! If you are in a support role, you will have difficulty achieving maximum compensation. You need to find ways to interact with directors of unrelated teams just to survive the annual review process."
good,great benefits but little advancement opportunities in  the home based area.  very location specific.  metrics are high to hit bonus and ranking effects schedule options.
good,I started there as a temp and was hired on and was promoted twice. I really enjoyed working there but it's very volatile. I was outsourced twice until I was laid off...will not return
good,I worked in the call center. I didn't like it and was not interested to work in that field anymore. If you don't like being on the phone don't work for them.
good,a lot of the customers feel as american experss agents you can move mountains-and have control over airlines and hotels. great perks though. I have no more to say.
good,"Its a good place to work in. One gets enough chances to learn and implement new technologies."
good,"Great place to work and good benefits, enjoyed my time working there whilst working and travelling in Sydney Australia, the department has now been closed and moved to the Philippines."
good,Nous n'étions que deux à gérer cette tâche mais nous avons été épaulés par un tiers Néerlandais basé à Madrid qui nous a bien épaulé
good,"This just came up, I worked on American Express accounts collecting for iQor. I was not able to just bypass this section, even though I have never directly worked for american express."
good,They outsourced so I feel operators were duped. The were on the leading edge of technology and good experience on resume. ave meet people that work there and horror stories are about the same about managment.
good,"I like working here but stressful. Management is not that great. Can improve in lot of areas. Still using old technologies. Not open minded crowd, mostly Indians."
good,Need to adhere to processes else project will be out of compliance. Budgets and schedules are monitored very closely. Approval process there at every stage of project life cycle
good,Nice company to work for workplace culture was ok a typical day at work was a lot of cool calling managment was helpful I enjoy making a lot of money with
good,"Satisfactory place to work, benefits adequate, work life balance on the decline in recent years, much work needs to be done around 'globalization' initiatives"
good,"- C-Suite dealings"
good,"Working at American express was ok. I just preferred to work in an environment that i was able move around instead of seating in same place for six to eight hrs. everything in my option was very robotic not much stimulation."
good,It's ok but could be better. Large business with many moving parts. Market in which operates is very dynamic and projects can be challenging but fun. Career opportunities very limited outside the US.
good,people generally are very nice but your managers/team leaders will determine the amount of flexibility you get in terms of working from home or even ability to easily take a personal day. Work is often unfairly and unequally spread amongst the team.
good,"PRC--AMEX was a hard job, handling lots of inbound calls from people wanting to cancel their accounts or to complain about the bill.  If you wanted to work, work was available, everyday."
good,"Long working day"
good,Great Pay Bad Management. Great time off as a contractor many days benefits were to expensive.  Hours were great reports were stupid and never made sense as far as getting our bonuses
good,"To be honest, I don't remember what I was responsible for.  I was a contractor and it was a while ago.  I know when I left, I was basically a floater.  But I didn't have benefits thru the contracting firm and needed them as I am a single mother"
good,A typical day at work for AMEX was intense based on the job you had.  Skills needed to be sharpen periodically to ensure successful of working at the company
good,"4 months of training and then several months of on the job training."
good,"Fun, high energy, collaborative environment."
good,"This was a very good entry level wholesaling job.  I learned a lot, but I was drawn to increased salary and expanded roles elsewhere in the Boston area.."
good,"Decent Pay. Pleasant People. "
good,"work hard play hard, can be a fun environment depending on what project you are working on. Stressful but also rewarding. can build long lasting relationships with everyone that you connect with"
good,"First real customer service job, was excited to learn all there was to learn about American express products and services. Enjoyed when clients phoned us to help on there account for balance inquiries or wire transfers and even card card disputes. Really got to learn how to use computers with this job and really enjoyed diving into that."
good,Worked at many locations in the Orlando area doing corporate and leisure travel reservations and also providing currency exchange services at the Airport location
good,"Company too big - employees just a number. "
good,This is a good job to work in the travel industry to gain experience in a call centre environment. Superior training is implemented for all employees.
good,I didn't find there much to learn though it's fun working there. People are good there but focus less on work & give attention to other stuffs more. But good experience.
good,"I used to love working there until the company decided to start firing people left and right, schedule bids too often, no stability, no way to advance in the company, and ridiculous metrics to meet, too many scripts that we had to make sound “not scripted”."
good,"I was there as a contractor and I have my own set allocated tasks to do.  My responsibility was to reconcile of Amex 2 Traveller Cheques, Sales & Cash on Hand Accounts, liaised with Finance team in India to investigate, solve problem transactions and followed up on outstanding payments of Amex 2."
good,I worked at American Express for 14 years. They laid me off within a group of 89 employees. It was a great place to work. Loved the benefits. flexible schedule at the time
good,The people that work there are great. I really cant say enough about the employees at Amex. We are the backbone. I still keep in touch with many people till this very day
good,"The culture at American Express is ever changing. They were really good at receiving input from employees regarding product improvements, new product ideas and customer feedback."
good,"The organization is in a constant state of flux, with teams being culled and jobs being lost all the time. People management is sorely missed by the leadership team."
good,"Employee Centric, Cares for all your needs, Great Work Culture, nice team members, Everything is great Company is overall good for work"
good,"Volunteers will be assisting staff by packing food boxes in the CVFB distribution facility that will go to malnourished seniors in our communities.  Each month, the seniors will receive a 30lb. box of groceries with a block of cheese and eventually fresh produce.  This will keep them independent and in their own homes longer!"
good,"good if you want to just come in, work a normal schedule, go home and not care about your job. not good if you are passionate and want to work hard and care about your job. some of the execs are rude and mediocrity is rewarded. highly political environment. very much about schmoozing"
good,"I learned that Amex is a great company with an excellent CEO.  However, many of the Leaders do not exemplify the core Leadership principles and blue box values put forth by the corporation."
good,"you work like an animal. bad managers, no benefits , you work with a a holdover so if people call out you can stay. some working are nice other are bad"
good,I have not worked at this company for 16 years. I hear they continue to lay employees off. There is not much else I can say about this company. The office is centrally located.
good,Received bonuses every quarter. Management was respectful to the employees. The hardest part was the fact that I worked overnight standing on my feet which was tiring most days.
good,"Good to work in American Express. Learnt a lot to build up my career, Ex: CICD initiatives. Good exposure to management as long as you deliver the needed."
good,"Great place to be exposed to cutting-edge technologies, and learn and grow. Employees are strongly encourage to take at least 5 days of growth learning classes per year.  Work/life balance is good, pay is sufficient, but medical benefits are sub-par. Technology and Business leadership struggle to get on the same page, and management lacks vision, fails at people development, and still operates in a command / control manner."
good,"I thought working there was fine.  It was a temporary job, and helped me and my wife make it while I was in college.  It was flexible enough with school."
good,Pay is good but you wont find a family feel here. Basically just do your job and don't try to think for yourself to often and you'll do fine. great benefits.
good,"Worked as a Customer Care Executive with American Express Card Member Services based in Travel Express Limited from January 1999."
good,"very busy, challenging, learn new things everyday. Good benefits. Diversity, good pay, a lot of people. friendly people and professional.  Flexible work schedules."
good,This was a sales job. Getting new clients was very difficult.  Doing the financial plans was very rewarding. Company culture was nice and lots of great co workers.
good,Its was ok but I didn't enjoy my time there that much the work was boring and repetitive but would be ok for stop gap job if you need employment don't stay there to long
good,i am not the best person to review a big company like american express express . All that i can say is that the company was great to have been a part of but just poor management.
good,"No company is perfect.  However, I enjoy the company for the most part.  Co-workers are fun and likeable.  There is opportunity for growth if you conduct yourself in a professional manner."
good,personally not my ideal job/ place of work but it made my year 11 work experience a pleasant experience. the managers where all nice and welcoming and the employees seemed to all get along and get the job done.
good,"I'm a customer care professional, I use to love working here but it's gotten to be extremely busy to the point that it's sickening. Thr benefits are great but those phones run you to the ground. The hourly is great but I enjoyed the incentives but they're always changing that too, every month they come up with some strategy to trick us into selling card products only not give us the money we earned."
good,"American Express sales executive from June 2005. Achieved maximum sales    throughout probation period with the bank and even succeeded in bringing some of the major HNI clients to Portfolio, therefore promoted to Territory sales leader within nine months."
good,"Company is still utilizing outdated systems.  "
good,Working with the company during the recession was difficult and working for almost a 10 years without advancement was frustrating. That was the only reason for leaving American Express.
good,Productive and fun place to work. company will help employess and support their career goals with new technolgies. The most enjoyable part of the job is workplace.
good,American epress was a fun environment. I really enjoyed the people. The management was also great. The only thing i didnt like was them switching the off days.
good,"Great work-life balance but not much room to grow, however. Managers assign tasks without providing much insight or context. Great Benefits and pay is good."
good,"work life balance is great"
good,"answering phones, answering emails speaking to staff, helping run running reports, filling in data, filing , meeting and greeting guests, following security procudures"
good,"Great multi cultural and international environment that challenges and invites. High work pressure due to the market requirments. People are required to be flexible and self starting. Great development opportunities within a wide range of capabilities. Great secondary rewards like pension schemes, in-house gym, and good private insurance. A place that will certainly cut your teeth and if you want you can achieve a lot and you do get the space to achieve just that. As with all big multinationals, working in the most efficient and effective way is met with many challenges on lots of levels unfortunately. But this also makes the people very creative and hands-on."
good,"•	Selling American Express Business cards to small and medium-sized businesses across Canada."
good,I learned to share experiences and knowledge with people from different countries. It was a rewarding experience. People are very caring. The hardest part of the job was getting promotion.
good,I loved the company for 8years then they began judging you on surveys that were sent out. they were not accurate and a lot of times were not even addressing you and they tore you down
good,"super Produkte, gute Arbeitsbedingungen, tolle Arbeitskollegen"
good,"Amex is generally a good place to work, however, it is all about your manager and team.  Its hard to characterize it holistically as your experience, benefit et al depend on team culture."
good,a typical day at work includes the obvious.. answering the phones. always a large call volume. must be able to know all cards and benefits. if you do not like sales then this job is not for you.
good,"They were bought out several times and with each change brought in consultants who did not understand the job. The original team was amazing, we had fun and learned together. Truly amazing, ashame they changed."
good,"Just a glorified call center. Not a real sales environment. The culture is a rah-rah environment and heavily monitored by the number of calls and compliance scoring which may affect your pay. Yes, they do take away commissions."
good,C'est une entreprise où l'on peut se projeter avec une bonne culture d'entreprise.
good,"Working in a call centre that has won many awards is an amazing experience."
good,"Typically a credit card company which offers different products and services to the the individuals and businesses , purely depending on the Credit Scoring."
good,It was a very fact paced environment and therefore it taught you to be quick on your feet and think and be pro-active and get the job done so the client always felt important.
good,"Converse with customers to determine destination, mode of transportation, travel dates, financial considerations, and accommodations required. Custom service"
good,"Responsible for successful collections and reconciliations on all company products portfolios in a call center inbound setting"
good,"No employee benefits, hard and smart worker is not rewarded always, There is no proper guidance for work, All are no treated equally. Appraisals are not based on performance."
good,"I had a positive 2 years at American express,"
good,Amex is growing to become more than a Credit Card company by leveraging the technology advancements to service their customers better. The company is highly investing in innovation by creating products like Ask Amex which would interact with customers using machine learning and help customers with their travel and other needs.
good,"Its a very good company to start with it gives you a lot of opportunities for career growth."
good,"•	Currently working as Program Manager/ Domain Lead for Cognizant at Columbus Ohio, USA. It a good company to work in challenging environment ,service based and driven company."
good,"working in a call center is tedious and aggrevation...  If you have worked in this feild before and are fine with it, then amex is probably one of the best paying telemarketing jobs out there."
good,"American Express used to be a GREAT place to work - but no more.  Company culture - especially within technologies - is shifting rapidly and is becoming very focused on short-term goals at the expense of the employees.  Work-life balance is laughable. Meetings with offshore teams at all hours (10pm, 5am common).  Vacations frequently canceled. Preference to hire from outside rather than promote from within."
good,"robotic, dialer-calling.... scripted conversations required. management was good. Work environment was great. very corporate, not personal. it was not the right job for me"
good,"The staff is friendly"
good,American Express is a business that is constantly growing and can change daily.  This can mean advancement or loss as jobs overseas positions are growing with AMEX. It's a job you have to take one day at a time.
good,"Although I only worked for American Express for 2 years I enjoyed the work I did. The hardest part of the job was having 2 co-workers that did not carry their weight so more work fell on me. The hardest thing for me was even though they tracked the percentage of work each person in the department did, we all got the same raise."
good,This was a contract position with Geometry working for American Express.  This is not for the faint of heart or anyone who needs guidance or direction.  You are on your own and have to come in with the numbers.
good,"Bait and switch is quite common. Hired for one thing and to support one person, ended up doing something completely different and supporting an entire team, in addition to my own personal projects."
good,"Worked my way through the company from settlements staff to senior trader. Great times and an amazing experience"
good,"American Express is employee friendly.Management is wonderful ,Good  ,loving.The most challenging is to make your own place as coworker ishardworking."
good,"American Exoress is a global services company that provides customers with access to products, insights and experiences that enrich lives and build business success."
good,"Frequent changes  since AMEX became a bank.  Spend more time conforming  to bank regulations, than doing travel and assisting Centurion cardmembers.   I'm tired of saying I'm sorry to the Centurion cardmembers that pay so much for their card.  We are supposed to be consulting for travel."
good,"Working around the service center I do notice so many high energy people who enjoy what they do (while they are there). Apparently there is a high turn over rate, welcome to corporate!"
good,"We had a very good team. Test Plan reviews, Test cases Creation, Execution and Reporting daily status to the manager. Involved in SIT (System Integration Testing) and UAT (User Acceptance Testing) also."
good,"Amex is a great company overall with nice people, but has become too slow and is unable to move quickly enough to be competitive.  Advancing in the company is difficult as greater value is place on planning events then actually deliver results."
good,"American Express have a great brand and a great reputation, however in this dynamic and increasingly technology-driven economy, I think they're end-up the same way as Blockbuster, Kodak, Motorola, Sony and others.  Being the best version of an old business model isn't a good business plan."
good,Busy and lots of projects. I learned things about every industry. Management changed from caring about employees to treating them as numbers. It was family and people worked very hard to keep it great
good,"This is a good place to work for all phases of career (entry, graduate, managerial, developer, intern and analyst etc).  Would recommend to anyone with ambition"
good,"Get a new Software to Learn i.e. Oracle."
good,"I have worked at American Express on a full time basis for a few years. I would say overall it is a good company to work for.  Work-life balance is great depending on which group you are in.  Most groups allow you to work from home most Fridays."
good,"My work experience here was great, I learned a lot about management and leadership, however was not able to obtain a work life balance."
good,"Target driven, committed and creative, I am looking forward applying my skills in a dynamic and challenging organization."
good,Good place to work but a benefits are not as good.  Management is not as involved with employees as they should be. Not much more to add.
good,"Ci si rapporta con  unità localizzate in vari paesi del mondo."
good,"Everyone you work with is pretty great, the worst thing about working for amex mr is the management. They have a major clique and race problem. "
good,"The Company, "
good,AMEX is a nice place to work in general.  People are nice and try to help out when asked.  Higher level leaders are a bit disconnected from the day to day activities under them.  Direct leaders are very engaged and try to work with their team members.
good,Great job work / life balance with Blue Works and flexible telecommuting.  Health benefits are really lacking.  Too many managers and directors over too few analysts.
good,american express was ok. the job description was different to the actual job role. american express sounds like a really good company to work for but only if your on a high salary band otherwise its just a normal company.
good,"It is a very stable blue chip Fortune 100 Financial Services Sector firm.  Management is top notch but very conservative.  A bit slow on the adoption of latest tech trends (but that is not a knock on the company.)  "
good,"Fast paced, and exciting.  I learned how to be a leader in this position.  I would recommend working here is you are a go getter!"
good,My role is focused on bringing innovation in technical architecture. Conditioning minds in to moving in to next gen thinking is both fun and hardest part in this environment.
good,"Company direction over the past 5 years has drifted, senior executives are no longer in touch with the market they once ruled."
good,"work from home , low employee morale , have meant some great people but now being forced to work weekends so work life balance is no longer present"
good,Leadership is too tactical and not strategic. Enterprise growth division in Tampa has too many contractors making difficult the work.
good,Worked for American Express just short of 10 years.  Constant change in expected matrix.  American Express went from a Credit card to a bank holding company and this impacted a lot of change as to what was expected of agents.
good,it was nice working with AMEX. They strictly follow Agile Methodology and the developers are given enough of flexibility to work without any pressure
good,"American Express has been a good place to work.  Recently, AMEX sold off my division and we are now owned by a private equity group."
good,"Working with American Express i got a lot Experience how to treat"
good,"American Express can be a great place to work if you can withstand the rookies years of BS. The hardest part about working here is the customers a large majority of them act liked entitle snobs who pretty much expect you to process payments, tutor their kids and take the dog for a walk as well! Once you are able to find the right position for yourself  and find out what makes you happy it can be an excellent place to work. On site Cafeteria, childcare, a nice amount of PTO even for entry level and pretty in depth training  just to name a few things."
good,I did pretty good here. I worked through four months of this job. I load boxes with packages that need to be delivered to a certain department.
good,"The didn't continue after training. I wanted a more hands on approach to in the job field, where i could interact with customers in person."
good,"This role provided an excellent opportunity to learn more about the profit center of a business. Additionally, it allowed for an expansion of my network by allowing me to work with various different stakeholder teams. I have learned as much as can be offered by the role and would like to leverage my skills within a more strategy based role."
good,"Started my carrier with Amex & I had a learnt lot many things while working with AMEX."
good,American Express is a decent company to work for . the benefits are good and vacation package as well as work life balance is decent. The job itself can be difficult at times because there are no set rules and several different managers giving you direction. There is no room for growth and after reaching a certain position you can become stuck.
good,"American Express is an American multinational financial services corporation. The company is best known for its credit card and charge cards, American Express cards account for approximately 24% of the total dollar volume of credit card transactions in the US. Our team has worked on the major enhancements for the client website which includes the changes majorly to sitemap and careers. Responsible for developing rich user interface for the customers."
good,"•	Received high volume of calls daily from customers regarding their membership awards program."
good,Amex provides great potential for the right person that is comfortable in a work at home environment. They compensate for their high expectations and look for the best of the best.
good,"Had a very nice time, good work culture, good career growth and money earning opportunity. Good brand image.. Overall average experience"
good,The work culture in American Express in India is very different from the one in US. They make employees do a lot of overtime and work pressure is huge.
good,"Working with a brand like American Express is always good and has its own benefits, overall a nice company to work with supportive management."
good,"Good money, hard work, unrealistic goals. Management tries their best. I found it very stressful, but good money. it is a nice company to work for. Many benefits."
good,"I enjoyed my position with American Express. The constant change of schedule was a dilemma for me, but other than that it was very informative and fulfilling."
good,"Ample work-life balance. A little lack of focus and leadership. "
good,Its very busy and high energy environment. Everybody is very focused in getting the results and also very good documentation record keeping.
good,"Ops risk management, compliance, ongoing monitoring"
good,"Like any other company, there is good and there is bad.  I prefer to remember the positive aspects and forget the negative aspects."
good,"Answered telephone call, helped card members with making payments, making travel arrangements and redeeming their points they earned on their credit card for merchandise."
good,Great benefits but a very large company and not always easy to navigate when trying to get answers from someone or make a decision when timing is urgent
good,"I had a great management team who supported me.  During my time as the Learning and Domain Administrator I learned quite a bit of information about our Learning Management System which also allowed me to become more savvy within Excel.  "
good,"Organization talks a lot about work life balance but does not practice what the preach. While much of the organization preaches flexible work from home arrangements, not all parts of the organization subscribe to this philosophy. Many parts of the organization still adhere to the old school belief that you need to be seen by your boss to get credit for being at work. Environment is very competitive and results in impacts team approach to getting things done. "
good,Gave me the ability to learn and explore opportunities both internal and external.  Timing was just off for long term future with the organization.
good,"≥ We used to start our day by confirming the fixed appointments with the clients."
good,"I Really like working for American Express.  I had a lot of fun there."
good,"Every day was the same at work, no promotion opportunities at all. Greatly disappointed."
good,"You tend to learn a lot here. "
good,"Could be better with supportive leadership. Unfair rating system, encouraging politics."
good,"Challenging work environment, enjoyable, uses the latest tools in the market"
good,Lots of opportunities to learn and grow. You get to work across different geographies.
good,"If you work hard, you have the potential to do very well long-term."
good,"A Task-master type environment, difficult to provide the level of service promised to clients."
good,"I was able to use my extensive knowledge to build teams, coached, trained and developed staff members, solve customer service and staff issues in a positive successful manner.  I developed new processes to use as a guide for the Future Leader process and I maintained a positive outlook to all concerns, monthly changes in direction and an overall 'will to win' mentality."
good,"American Express is best known for its credit card, charge card, and traveler’s cheque businesses"
good,"Heavy phones, heavy customer service duties, Management and co-workers very professional.  Must be very dedicated to deal with customers daily."
good,The balance is like nothing I have personally experienced in this position.
good,American Express is also a very all over Diversified Company
good,AMEX is a good place to learn and grow and establish your self and build solid unterstanding of today's growing IT industry.
good,Get to learn a lot of new things in every project. Have very good development work.
good,lovely place great benefits caring company stand for nothing but the best a place you can grow into a company you want to work for because they care about there employess

good,"Customer Service Rep.  Answer incoming calls from American Express customers concerning Car Rental Loss and Damage Insurance.  Handled policy calls explaining the coverage available with the customers particular car and take claims from card members that had theft, damage or collision to the rental vehicle"
good,"work on new accounts and collect balances due on cards. I learned that you just do your job and no more. I had one good co-worker, but we could only talk at break and lunch.  The hardest part of the job was you always felt alone.  I did enjoy going to work so early and getting off early so I had the rest of the afternoon to myself to do what I needed to do for myself."
good,"Incoming calls, navigation problems, troubleshooting, escalating cases"
good,"Empresa que me ensinou a melhor me comunicar , saber escutar os problemas dos clientes, ter pontualidade nos horarios e ser reconhecido pelos resultados alcansados."
good,Company offers great work life balance approach and is employee focused
good,When I was there it was a slow paced call center; learned about bank products and customer service.
good,"The culture of the company is strong. If your young and fashionable this is the place for you. For job security it's a startup so it's hard to keep your place, you have you have to really work for what you want."
good,Nice & Calm place to work. Professional environment.supportive team
good,"This job was Great, then outsourcing started and lay-offs began."
good,"My experience at American Express was okay. Being in the office we had limited work/life balance opportunities. The compensation was above market average. The benefits were above average the first year. Then the company went cheap. A large amount of our pay went to our benefits, since our health insurance had such high duct. on the best plans. Job security was alright, but company does layoffs every other year in small amounts. There are opportunities to advance how my counter parts and I did but again JOB SECURITY is not the best with this company. Management was fine. They were under a lot of pressure from corporate. Overall nice team managers. Job culture was acceptable. Very nice co-workers."
good,"a typical day at work"
good,"Multiitasking, multiple meetings with global teams.  Learned to understand business processes globally and how they differed or were the same"
good,"When I started you could feel they really cared about the employees and their success. As time went on and management changed we were required to handle more of other departments jobs with the same pay. We use to get time off the phone to listen to calls and help us evaluate what was working and not working in our calls to help service our customers better, but they did not schedule for call flows correctly on the last couple of shift bids so for the last two years we were not allowed any time off the phones to better ourselves or get feedback. The customer services reps won them the JD Powers award for best customer service for seven years and to show it appreciation for our hard work we got a cupcake. We got incentives based on our surveys but the system did not work correctly and we would consistently get bad surveys from other departments that would effect our money but was told nothing could be done. You can make incentives, but they keep changing the goals as more people reach them they set the standards higher."
good,"Start my day at 8am with Balancing and reconciliation the accounts for the previous day, lunch time is at 12 and finish my day at 4pm"
good,A typical day at this job was very busy.  I learned how to manage handling stressful situations with this job.  The management was very nice and enthusiastic about their positions.  My co-workers were very social and fun to be around.  The hardest part of this job was sitting for extended periods of time.  The most enjoyable part of this job was the company incentives.
good,"Finance organization of the company has great culture/values, teamwork."
good,"I have not worked this company but I would like to write my review for Amex canada."
good,"Training wasn't very thorough, learned more when on the floor. Managers were friendly, got frequent breaks to stretch since it was a call center. Hours were 12 hour days which may not have been my in my best interest."
good,"High call volume, goal oriented, high pressure, quality assurance qualifications"
good,It was a a great place to learn great work habits and take my talents to the next lext
good,"Have really enjoyed my time to date at American Express.  Great company to work with solid benefits and excellent work/life balance."
good,"The was a great job for someone coming out of college, however it is not  challenging for me anymore"
good,Relocating to a new state where Management was not focused on retention and growth was challenging.
good,"A typical day at the office consisted of answering phones calls for department, composing memos, typing reports and expense reports."
good,Good Company to grow and move up internally. Your co-workers keep you motivated and a fun place to work. Opportunity for development offered if you initiate it.
good,Ok Culture
good,"Very good to be working at American Express Client and in Data Warehousing Technology and Extraction, Transformation and Loading and in Teradata Technology."
good,I work from home currently and I absolutely love it. I am very disciplined and have no problems staying on task. I am a self starter and highly motivated individual and can get a lot done in a day. I try to make sure that I am efficient as possible and pride myself on that.
good,They are good people to work for but have no benefits. Too little job security.
good,"Provided prompt, efficient handling of incoming telephone inquiries on company services, products and general inquires. Managed account reconcilation, disputes. fraud back-up, account maintenance, billing inquiries, internet access and processed payments."
good,"went to work answered phone, helped customers, managers were good, co-workers were great."
good,Very good company with 401k benefit
good,Interesting work interacting with multiple business needs for travel.
good,"Very complicated system architecture, making it a great place to learn. Fast-growing division allowed for ample project work. Very competent co-workers."
good,frequent shift change
good,They relied on quantity not quality. It was entirely a numbers game during an unfortunate correction in the market
good,Overload sometimes. It was not the most diverse workplace. Lead to insular managers.
good,My time there was good. Meet some nice people. Job overall wasn't hard to do. Gained a lot of experience during my venture at american express.
good,A good job for someone young and starting out in the corporate world.
good,"for quite long working in travel industry i have learned a lot from each of every hotels all over the world all the airlines we are dealing with, learned how to handle all rich and normal people here in middle east assisting all the type of clients. my co-workers they are like my family where ever I've join the company i have treats them as my second family. the hardest part of my job is to have an client complaints :-( . most enjoyable on this job is to have a fam trip and company complimentary trip holidays all over the world free everything sponsored by airlines and hotel the reason why i never leave this field. i love to travel that's why."
good,Very challenging and satisfying
good,Responsible for creating a test environment to ensure the needs and requirements of the client were met by deadline for several different countries. Recognizing software issues and working with programmers to resolve issues before deadline to ensure smooth implementation.
good,"Good first job for an entry-level attorney, however management structure leaves a lot to be desired."
good,Easier to enter the company from outside the company at a higher position then to be promoted up from within the company. Very small annual pay raises if any.
good,American Express is definately a more relaxed environment in comparision to other financial companies. It definately lacks in opportunities for advancement to those who strictly adhere to work ethics and merrits. The work life balance is pretty good depending on your manager. Some are really open to understanding that you have a life outside of work and sometimes children demand attentions which require you to stay home (like when they get sick) and then there are others who do not understand this at all.
good,"American Express - good focus on work alternatives, technology, global company with great brand"
good,Verified applications for accurate or fraudulent information.
good,"was always busy and fast paced, had coaches to help you get better and there was good food in the vending machines as well as, there were burger places across the street and close by"
good,"Worked here as a consultant tech BSA, overall a nice experience, good opportunites to learn and grow."
good,"Man kann es dort zwar gut aushalten, aber sich weiterzuentwickeln ist nicht möglich."
good,I enjoyed my time there. They have really fantastic benefits. Their pay is also very reasonable. I usually felt valued as an employee. Management was usually great.
good,"Worldwide company gave me possibility of relationship with other colleagues in different countries and languages."
good,"Fun to work with but never join as a contractor. Make sure you know what you are getting into before you join."
good,Much dissatisfaction among staff. Not a pleasant environment to work in. Senior staff keeping team members out of the loop and partisanship between departments hinders cohesive working.
good,It’s corporate America. What more needs to be said? They lay-off too often and send jobs overseas. Management is good because they are personable and care about their employees. Pay could be better. Diversity is rampant among the culture which was great.
good,Niet het beste bedrijf om te werken. Zien hun medewerkers als vervangbaar en gaan er ook zo mee om.
good,"Amex as a company is actually very employee-centric. However, when it comes to management there are people now who are ruining the reputation.  Management shows there power in case any employee complains about any senior."
good,"good company to work and good experience, Well cultured and good learning opportunity to learn new technologies ."
good,"Great people.."
good,"compagnie dans laquelle l'on retrouve cette culture de proximité et de bon vivre au travail , typique aux entreprises américains."
good,"Culture is alright at Amex, downtime & overtime is available when business is needed. Excellent benefits, that included Life Insu,health, dental, vision etc"
good,I have worked at American Express for some time now.  I started with a low salary but over the years that salary has increased to much higher than I could start at a new company.  That and the ability to work 100% virtually has kept me satisfied in my position.  There are other companies that are more progressive with technology.
good,The company will expend great resources do train/invest in you which is a huge positive. The work is highly repetitive & sometimes meaningless. Management (depending on team) can be very vindictive & moody.
good,Work life balance varies based on the team culture. Usually colleagues supportive of maintaining a good balance. Great diversity at workplace and global exposure
good,"I enjoyed working with a wide range of Amex people:Utah, Atlanta, Ft. Lauderdale, Mexico and Australia. "
good,Management needs improvement . Benefits not affordable. Need more than a 30min lunch. PTO need more time. More professional in the hiring the dress code needs to be improved. Staff and and employees needs more training one on one. Training needs improvement
good,"The work culture and ethic was very good. A place where (in sure if this is still the case) management stressed on how to deal with clients professionally and provide the best in class service. My stint at AMEX Canada helped build my approach to how I work with both internal and external clients."
good,American Express was a fun company to work for. The people there are great and the environment is kind of laid back even when it’s busy. The work itself can be a little tedious but everyone is always willing to help.
good,This was a solid place to work for several years.  It was just time for a change. Remember that people usually quit because of their leader and this was no different.
good,"I enjoyed my short stint at American Express GBT. However, I would not recommend this workplace in the nascent years of one's career as this is a more stable, slow-paced work environment. The upside is you will have a lot of stability, slow but steady growth, and job security. But you will lose fuel if you stick around for too long. Also, it is a legacy workplace, so not the most satisfying place for millennials and Gen Y/Z."
good,Decent work environment and co-workers worked hard to keep the business going. Management tried different things to compensate work schedules for the disabled and supported the veteran community.
good,"Key skills learnt,learnt to meet deadlines,meeting customer requirements,calling with heads,conferences attended,rewarded for good work,used to live like family,celebrating festivals"
good,"Esprit jeune et dynamique"
good,"Great benefits, horrible management. I had a harassment issue with my manager and asked to be changed of departments and was never allowed to switch because he was the one in charge of the decision and that led me to leaving the company altogether."
good,"Great place to work but hard to advance, a lot of politics and you must be in your position for at least 18 months to advance.  Great people and decent benefits."
good,"I loved my position at AmEx, until they outsourced my department to the Philippines, and ""let go"" 17 out of our 24 supervisors. This is a good place to be, if you can move up in a company that is outsourcing all of it's departments."
good,"The over all company values were well rounded and great! i did not feel like there were opportunities to advance under the leadership I had, but it was based on group to group."
good,A typical day I would be on the phones with our clients helping them solve their financial problems. Management assisted greatly and I enjoyed working at AMEX.
good,"A typical day at work started at 9.00 am and ended at 5.30 pm with one hours lunch break, Learnt a lot through different management styles used by different managers. The work environment was very accommodating and staff allowed to interact with managers freely."
good,"American Express offered pretty good starting pay/benefits, unfortunately they outsource jobs all the time. Leaving you with an insecure feeling. Management always seems to land on their feet. employees are left with the not so desired jobs"
good,"The workplace culture is relaxed. However, it's still a call center. Therefore you should expect the same rules. I worked 12 hours shift that was stressful but I had three days off."
good,The workplace is relaxing but being a finance company they still operate on old technologies. However they are now slowly moving to adopt new technologies but its a long way.
good,"Very talented, intelligent employee pool.  If you are linked to the correct progressive leaders then you'll be nurtured.  Very competitive on many levels - not enough opportunity for all the people that excel."
good,"- Une journée de travail au sein D'Aexp au service clientel c est :"
good,Son was in High School and it was difficult to work late shift at home due to many friends and music. Probably not the best environment to work in. Only choice was to work from home due to the nature of the call center.
good,"The work place was friendly with equal accessibility to management. It gave me lot of exposure which also helped me in boosting my level of confidence"
good,"Nice work environment, and work life balance. Leadership is generally very competent. Typical big company lethargy in decision making, and some resistance to change. Ability to change jobs every 2 years, which keeps things interesting. "
good,"In addition to facilitating training, my writing skills were recognized as a strong asset and I was give the opportunity to fully redesign an outmoded Customer Service course, for which I rewrote both leader and participant guides and re-trained course facilitators."
good,Each department has its benefits. I've heard absolutely wonderful things about the other departments. I've only witnessed the travel department and my experience hasn't been the greatest.
good,"It can be very busy during the day but before and after the matches it was quiet and they day took a long time to finish."
good,Pay attention read and listen carefully. Get everything in writing. Prayerfully in the future they will be kept in US. Loved community involvement and diversity.
good,"I learned a lot about recruitment as a process and the company in depth.enjoyed the work culture,the only problem and the thing i didnt like is the bias nature some management has ."
good,"On a typical day I would make sure that the employees of American Express would have their necessary travel plan for various meetings.  I worked with the Apollo desk department, that only communicates with other computers in the Apollo language to get the necessary travel plans needed."
good,"The UK Consumer business is very dynamic, with many smart talented people.  Culture in the Corporate unit is very sales-driven and tends to be more chaotic.  "
good,Even as a monthly top performer I always felt like my work wasn't good enough.  It was a very stressful environment.  The pay and benefits were great through.
good,I really enjoyed my time at American Express.  The culture was awesome and I was able to make many connections that I still keep today.  It was a great place to start my corporate career.
good,"management isn't that great, layoffs are happening everywhere, lack of ability to advice due to the layoffs. no help advancing in the industry. bonus are being cut"
good,"Employee role and requirements are leading to changes to the company. The changes have not been well understood and the Company is attempting to move into a more agile development environment, reducing controls but continuing to require compliance to some standards."
good,"Company is good but when it comes to salary increments ND all, they don't do much..otgerwise environment is great.. But company should consider their deserving employees with good salary increments"
good,"I  worked as a full time bilingual customer professional. I started as a sale agent, then went into training new hires after that my last position was high value bilingual ccp."
good,American Express is a good company to work for. They sold off 50% of a portion to be named Global Business Travel. This new portion has management that seems to have lost the American Express Way. Their seems to be no more value in the employees and any work life balance. American Express was know at one time for the training of their employees. That is a thing of the past. Very sad.
good,"I enjoyed working for America Express everyone was so friendly, we were always very busy and i gained alot of problem solving skills working here. I was given alot of opportunity for growth."
good,Work with clients during the implementation phase to try and get them to maximize spend asap. Most tools you need won't work with you need them because of constant pilots and ever changing processes. New projects and products get introduced rather than perfecting existing program
good,"It is a great place to work always busy and productive and I met some great friends and people, good pay but not much advancement in the company. Need more people to work in the company."
good,"The company offers good benefits for their employees but with the movement of jobs out of the country, there's insecurity about the future of positions in the U.S."
good,"Job was very Stressful at times. To many Chiefs not enough indians. Lots of overtime available, Over all an okay place to work. With really great benefits."
good,"The company culture has changed in the last several years; customer service has become about sales entirely. It is difficult to get questions answered and much of the job requires you to learn on your own. The company has high standards so be prepared to work hard. Working from home is not as flexible with the company as it used to be. You are given a lot of PTO but it's difficult to find time when they will let you use it and it must be scheduled 4 weeks in advance. Do not get sick. It is a pretty rigid corporate atmosphere and human resources is not your friend. The compensation is great if you don't mind paying the price of your soul. If you are a salesman at heart, this is a place you can truly thrive. If the prospect of sales is intimidating, do not apply; you can thank me later. In-bound calls only but sales are required on more than half your calls."
good,"Provided that you arrive to work on time and adhere to you schedule, you will always have a job here.  the issue becomes the longer that you are there the more you are trained to do and you are not compensated for it. There are advancement freezes put in place often which keep employees from moving to other departments and positions."
good,"La venta era facil de adquirirla con el cliente, pero el indice de que aplicaran para ser sujetos a una tarjeta de credito era muy bajo."
good,"Too many layers of management and too many hands in the pot. Amex reacts instead of being proactive. Senior management wants ideas on how to fix what's ""broken"" yet really they want a band aide solution."
good,"Technologies division is in the process of transitioning into using the Agile Project Management methodologies. However, they are forcing this into the organization regardless whether or not the methodology Is appropriate for the area, which makes it difficult to meet objectives. Minimal training was provided before being forced into using the methodology."
good,In my opinion the company as a whole is not what it was 10 years ago. They have good benefits and give a great amount of time off up front so people can have a chance at a work life balance.  But in my opinion the company seems to be focusing on the shareholders rather than the employees.
good,"They pay well, have fair benefits, good work life balance and attempt to create a positive culture. However, they are behind the times in product growth and frequently make bad decisions that effect the entire company. Every year, if not twice a year people wait with baited breathe to see if they will be one of the people getting axed in the current ""reorganizing"" round. The last round consisted of 10% of the entire company. Very shaky and unstable. You constantly feel insecure."
good,"No trabajas tus 8 horas si no mas de la cuenta"
good,"Started off with great productivity , One Black Card Centurion high achiever my 1st year there. After 1st year management changed and morale changed. lots of turnover and job got verry stressful"
good,Company has been on the decline with good leaders leaving and bad ones staying. Very passive aggressive culture where you need to know people rather than do work
good,"Er was geen teamleader aanwezig, dit maakte het werk soms lastig."
good,"Rewarding work, talented individuals, telecommuting available, opportunity to learn new function and acquire new skills.  Great company to work for."
good,"Met some great people while working there. The manager was great and understanding. The hardest part dealing with angry clients and finding ways to be assertive and provide great customer service. The workplace found ways to make the environment friendly, by playing games and once a month they would buy food for the whole floor as a thank you, for their great work efforts."
good,"Working in American Express was a good experience. And this is the one of the most secure job in Travel Industry.."
good,"Its Good company with good work culture."
good,"In this company I worked for almost four years and it has become my second home. A typical day at work, you can have a lot of work and pressure, but we can always give a break to tell a joke and de-stress. What I learned, you always learn something new, there is much to learn from people with whom you live with all around you and your leaders. The management / management is always looking to give the best to its people. The hardest part of the job is now, having to leave. The part I like most about the job is the relationship with colleagues, enthusiasm and learning I've been me."
good,"I liked the benefits and zen rooms. I enjoyed working for the company. A typical day at work is on the phones making airline, hotel, and car reservations. I learned how to multitask, and give great customer service. There was a environment of politics however the managers were supportive and they assisted with development"
good,"Nothing horrible, nothing great. Your leadership will have a big impact on your overall happiness. If you get a manager you don't agree with, it will be miserable. Mine likes to micromanage, but not all are like this. They determine the experience you will have while working for Amex."
good,"In AMEX I learned to be a smart worker.Co-workers are so friendly."
good,As a customer service representative I answered inbound calls pertaining to credit card inquires and issues. Resolved issues and disputes with skills obtained in management positions. Researched accounts and assured that all company policies and procedures were being met and followed correctly for the wellbeing of the customer and the company. The metrics expectations were extremley high and at times unobtainable. Working 3rd shift was very trying in reference to metrics because most people wanted to call and talk and vent at the hours I worked.
good,"As soon as I was logged into the computer and phone I was taking incoming calls. Before I could even talk to the card member I had a series of security questions they had to answer first. Sometimes you had the patient caller and sometimes you didn't. That is when you have that gut feeling that the call is not going to be pleasant. Fortunately, the nice callers knew what they wanted and that was great. The other callers were the one's who made your job a nightmare. Then to top it off, American Express would randomly send out surveys to have the call rated about our customer service levels and it would come back on us. "
good,"•	Engaging with premium customers to build relationships, and delivering a positive customer experience while acquiring new customers"
good,"all in all I like working here, but upward mobility is limited. American Express is doing some massive soul searching in its AET area, in five years, I've seen a group that I work with create the same product over and over with the same limitations."
good,"All jobs have a level of stress but at times the stress level here can be through the roof.  There can be a bit of favoritism and there is a false sense of advancement with lateral moves after lateral move.  I have seen some advance and overall believe the company has a great culture, but it is starting to wane due to many people taking ideas that are not theirs as their own and keeping the people they want in management and advancement opportunities.  The focus on keeping the front line employee satisfied has shifted which causes a poor morale across the board. I started working here with a sense of family and pride which is no longer something I believe in here."
good,"Overall this is a good, solid company. I worked within sales which ultimately was not a good fit for me. When I decided to leave the company offered me a unique position that was a better fit for my skill set which I really appreciated. Ultimately, the environment still was not a good match, so I left the company."
good,Back to back phone calls. Open chats to allow communication between co workers and with management. Continuous updates; hard and soft copies. It was a fun work environment. The company did a lot for employee moral.
good,"in a typical workday i service calls from various card members anything from taking payments to setting up disputes. The job itself in not really hard it's just a bit tedious, you take the same calls over and over again."
good,"Enjoyed the flexibility"
good,"- Throughout most days I spend consistently on the phone answering card members questions and queries."
good,work for business development of company regarding credit card sell
good,"American Express has 24 hour weekend schedules.  When possible they are very flexible with work hours.   They offer a number of benefits including child care,   There medical benefits are comparable to other major companies."
good,"This role challenged you to think quick and outside of the box.  I loved the changing environment and working with so many different levels of management and styles of people.  My role was diverse reading, interpreting policies and procedures and then implementing best practices within my team.  Constant coaching and feedback is crucial but it is also very important to allow them to provide input and take accountability on KPI's.  I was instrumental in compiling the team and building it to a dedicated and respected department.  I worked with key stakeholders in Australia but also held and attended regular calls globally.  I had a team in India as well which I trained and coached.  Due to changing and the growing of the legal obligations I worked with the compliance and audit teams on a regular basis.  Unfortunately the hours required and constraints grew and unfortunately when my mother got very ill, I choose to leave.  I am still very good friends with many of the people there and hold them dear as people are my passion."
good,"I worked 20+ years at American Express and loved my job accept the last few years as it is now all about surviving lay offs over and over again.  Finally, I was laid off but did get a great severance package.  Management is now about doing whatever they can to save their own job and may throw you under the bus if necessary.  The hardest part of the job is senior level management believing they are above anyone else and the increasingly super high cost of benefits.  The salaries are great but check out the cost of benefits that can take a bite out of your salary.  Again, for the most part I loved my tenure at American Express and if offered the right position reporting to a good manager I would love to go back as the people you work with are amazing."
good,the day to day of the job was the same to help customers resolve delinquency what made the job fun was the coworkers  was a well supported environment. the team atmosphere was always a pick me up.. with all the changes in our industry management didn't fight for wronged workers out of fear of recourse.. managed by fear which sometimes made for a stressful situation... 98% of the job was great
good,"Sales and account management for American Express, telephone sales with approximately 150 calls per day."
good,"You really have to fight to learn more and advance.  Things I've wanted to learn and have access to have taken years to finally get done.  As far as work/life balance...it's pretty much impossible to get much needed schedule adjustments.  Business needs are far more important that employees needs.  Some managers/leaders will really go out on a limb for you...most won't.  The most important factor is numbers...period.  The best thing about working for the company is the vacation benefits, which start at day 1, after a year you can purchase up to 5 more pto days and after 5 years you earn another 40hrs, after 10 years another 40hrs after that.  That's what's kept me here this long, not wanting to start over somewhere else with time off with family.  Although the vacation time is great, it's sometimes very hard to get the time off you actually want."
good,"Great Company to work for.."
good,"Une journée de travail typique : gestion de l'agenda du jour et de la semaine. Point sur les urgences avec ma Directrice et son équipe.Traitement des emails/courrier et des appels. Gestion des tâches administratives : règlement des factures, mise à jour des archives et bases de données... Aide à l'équipe : préparation de communications officielles, de présentations, de résumés de réunion, mise en relation avec les équipes partenaires sur place ou à l'international, les équipes support technique..."
good,"Un gran equipo,no sabias nunca donde te iba a tocar sin en cancelacion,en tpv,tenias que aprender a desconectar rapidamente"
good,"Voor een periode van 3 maanden ingehuurd om de American Express kaart van mensen te activeren die tegelijk ook hun lidmaatschapskaart van Flying Dutchman (KLM/Air France) was. "
good,"Micro managed our work time to the second, but the co-workers were great to work with. My day would consist of inbound and outbound calls to credit card holders assisting them charges, payments, etc."
good,"Temporary position.  My team is young and creative, the environment is great for new ideas and development."
good,I look forward going home to my son at the end of the day. I am grateful for working with a great group of EAs which makes working here better.
good,"The training was impeccable. I felt prepared when I was asked to perform my job. I learned a lot of valuable lessons that helped me in future endeavors such as leadership. I enjoyed the majority of my coworkers. The toughest part of the job was dealing with emergency situations, but I was very successful in resolving issues as they arose. The most enjoyable part was the traveling benefits."
good,"Working in a special project for Human Resources Department"
good,High volume. Quality emphasized with all customer interaction. Learned AMEX quality standards. Management willing to work with agents on ALL job related issues. Hardest part of job - none because of the training and management support. Office was relaxed but always customer oriented. 
good,"Took/made approximately 100 calls per day, learned Lotus Notes, and phone skills, among many other things. Co-workers friendly. Management is very strict. Best part of the company is benefits."
good,"good leadership, work/life balance, lots of career mobility"
good,"if you work hard, opportunities will arise for you."
good,"One of the factors that brought me to American Express was the diversity. An employee can expand their knowledge and reinvent themselves through the many different job opportunities with this company. Start in business travel, then move to finance, and card and so on. The best way to be well-rounded is to work for a company that offers those opportunities, and Amex does."
good,"I have worked at American Express twice, the pay and benefits are above the standards. I enjoy most things about the Amex I certainly have enjoyed working with the clients and the day to day changes that make things challenging. Discipline is a major key when working with Amex, if everyone that worked there had the discipline that was required and focused as much as Amex requires it would create a flawless Blue Box product. That is what should happen with every company out there, not to say that it has to be micro managed, but people should be proud of their work place and want to make it SHINE."
good,"My job starts at 8:30 a.m. , the first thing I do is check the email of my corporate passengers for their travel needs. Then I check the documents that my passengers submitted for their Visa requirements. Then I submitted it to our documentation department and at the same time checked if my passengers visa was already issued and then have it delivered to their office. After doing all those hings, I will then book my passengers on their requested flights then emailed their tickets and Iterinary to the passengers emails. If they have some changes in their iterinary, I always inform them about and the charges that occcured. I have learned to communicate with my passengers through email. .. While with the management we seldom interact with them unless there's an issue to be tackled or some events. Me and my coworkers treat each other as family, we help each other if one is in difficult in meeting our task. I have enjoyed working with the company because of the challenge of giving satisfactory service to our passengers travel needs."
good,Amex - is a great company - with plenty of opportunity. It is a company that really looks to promote those who are college educated. The more degrees and certifications - the better the opportunities. Amex is a very conservative company that is the leading financial services providor in the world. With this top position - comes a lot of downfall for US Domestic employees. The less educated you are the higher the chance that your position will end up in India. Hundreds upon hundreds of employees have been laid off in recent years and their positions moved to India. This company values hard work - and unfortunatley long hours come with increasing levels of responsibility.
good,"Work was in a safe and stable environment, I learned the corporate hierarchy, management was ok, my co-workers were ok, the hardest part of the job was maintaining a good business relationship because it was hard to difuse the situation, meeting numbers and giving excellent customer service"
good,"You answer the phone non-stop all day, very repetitive work with little or no space for creativity and extremely rude clients who will almost always be unsatisfied with everything you do."
good,"When you work at American Express, you become a number. The company has great bennifits."
good,Working at American Express I learned that hard work doesn’t always pay off.
good,"Work from home availability is nice, and is easily the best aspect of this job. People are friendly. Pay is OK, but annual increases are very rigid and incentive structures to go above and beyond are lacking."
good,It's very nice working with AMEX ... t technology stack is good when compared to other work places and work culture at amex is very good compared  to other places.
good,"Job security was definitely a plus at AMEX. The culture is very old and hierarchical. They give lips service to change, but they’re not committed to it."
good,"Company is great, but If you aren't able to adapt to the culture you'll never advance your career. The line of business that you're in is important as well."
good,"Great place to meet people and network. You will probably leave here with lifelong friends, however the work is a bit mundane. If enjoy a super stress-free job with very little excitement (most of the time), Amex is a great place to be - for more challenging, thought provoking work, probably not in the long run. The benefits and culture is also quite favorable."
good,"They tell you that you'll be doing customer service with some sales included, but the reality is that sales is very important to your job and you can lose your job by not offering new products to customers. These people call in to get their account serviced, not to be stressed out about applying for a new card or a new product. They hide the sales as apart of relationship care, that we're helping the customer, but at the end of the day it's about bringing more money in."
good,"Arbeitsklima ist OK, leider wird die vom Senior Management unterstützte Home Office Zeit nicht in allen Abteilungen gelebt."
good,Overall it was a good opportunity. Overtime was almost unlimited therefore bringing home great checks every two weeks. I did not like the fact if someone transfers an angry customer to you and when the customer get their survey they are rating you although they are mad at the person before you.
good,Amex Credit Corp no longer exists. Their commercial paper was farmed out to another company and all the workers were either let go with a severance or they could transfer somewhere else.
good,"They gave you a lot of education and it was a pretty supportive place to work.  Selling Amex cards gave your credibility when you walked into a business, you at least had a chance to grab the ear of the business owner because you had brand awareness."
good,"I’ve been here a long time and I used to really like my job. They have laid off most of the support staff so there is nobody around to help-or to speak to the irate customers. Travel counselors have more and more work piled on us and we are just supposed to smile and keep going even when there is no way we can do it all. The management just keeps piling it on but they have never had to do the job. We have a lot of time off but we can’t use it. There are 2 hour hold times and it is OUR fault if our clients are upset when they finally get to us. Most of the  clients are now are spoiled, rude , and completely unreasonable. We have about 8 different computer systems we have to use and they are all bad. Makes it impossible to work effectively and efficiently. There is a very high turnover and everyone talks about quitting."
good,"I would recommend working at Amex. if you want to work in the corporate world. However, I think there's a lot of ageism that happens there. Most people are in their 20s and 30s, unless you're an EA or at the very top."
good,"Plenty of training, but too much regulation and monitoring to be really comfortable doing the meat of the job. Building is beautiful and offers lots of recreation activities, but if you're ""on the phones,"" you'll never get a chance to enjoy any of it."
good,American Express is a good company to work for. Work life balance is a great benefit. The corporate office is located in downtown Manhattan. Lots of nice perks.
good,"Great colleagues who are all very intelligent and bright"
good,Good Company to work for but I had my working hours changed 5 times in 11 months.  I would like a more consistent work day and my requests fell on deaf ears.
good,"A typical day was very numbers oriented in the credit collections department, a bit stressful and goal oriented. I learned a lot about the financial industry. the management was pretty good, but it was a while ago, I don't know what it is like now. The culture was friendly but very business oriented. The hardest part of the job was reaching goals, even though it wasn't that hard for me. I was one of the top collectors. Again the most enjoyable part of the job was the customers and helping them resolve any situation that may exist, either in credit or collections, I worked both."
good,"Flexibilidad horaria, escasas oportunidades de conseguir contrato"
good,I was there for a short period. I worked 6 months. Training class was about 20 in a class. The trainer was really good and very thorough. She would always review to make sure we understood what we were doing. I learned the application process of how customers are approved for a credit card with American Express. The company treated their employees very well. They also had extra incentives for reps to earn extra money. They also had built in cafeteria to serve employee hot lunches.
good,"If you can keep the calls under the set time frame, interacting with people and love problem solving, you can really make a career with them. Great compensation and benefits."
good,If You want a hands on experience about sales this is the place. crunch situations 24*7 and there is not a single day which goes easy.The management really employee oriented .
good,I loved working in the travel industry but it collapsed on me after 9/11. My first experience with the company was not so good because I am not a fan of working in a call center but my second time around in a small office was much better.I was sad to see my career as a travel agent come to an end after 10 years
good,American Express does a great job of focusing on the shareholder first and foremost so job security can be limited as a whole.  They have many benefits which are good and family friendly.
good,"Very well organized company with great benefits. The work environment is great, and easy to work with. The job benefits are definitively and add bonus to working there"
good,"100-150 cold calls daily."
good,I got lot of experience of cold calling. The way i was speaking with every client the knowledge i was getting. It helped me to improve my communications. It also helped me to know how to generate the leads.
good,"Enjoyed working at American Express. However, the company is very bureaucratic. Senior management asks employees to respond to changes in unreasonable times. Culture is very collaborative and people genuinely enjoy working here."
good,"Organisation is going through a massive transformation which results in a degree of instability."
good,"Fun place to work. Projects are paced at high speed. The good thing is they are agile, so projects run at great speed."
good,"US team is awesome and the most enjoyable part of the job is to work with them.  US line of businesses teams are supportive, understanding and great in what they do!"
good,Company was definitely more interested in its bottom line than employees. Decisions often didn't take employees into consideration. Decisions were often made by people that had never worked in specific areas that their decisions affected
good,"The overall experience of last 6yrs with Amex had been really amazing, however the core for which everyone is working is money if that is something that is missing it gets hard to stay motivated at work."
good,"Strong culture, great place to train and advance your career if you put the effort into it.  "
good,"The company changes and reacts often.  Jobs have recently been outsourced to Philippines and India. "
good,"I have worked in AMEX twice, first time in Stockholm, Sweden and second time in Brighton, UK. I found both of my jobs in Amex quite simple but challenging at the same time. Both of my positions in Amex have been customer care level positions and the work tasks on that level are quite repetitive tasks. That's what makes the job simple and easy. Then the challenging part was to keep myself up to date of all the new updates that were released, for the programs I worked with, every month if not every week. "
good,its a great company to work for it is has great people and structure. i have learned that its all about great management and workers that work hard. that is what american express is about.
good,"work with amex was nice, it was my first job as a fresher, everything to this job was related to sales of high end credit cards."
good,"PROS:"
good,My first contract Job at a call centre in Amex Hamilton. worked on both Apollo and Sabre took calls and made corporate travel arrangements for our clients like GM and price water coopers
good,"taking calls from corporate clients and arranging travel related services for them."
good,"Not a good environment at the moment, great location however i think pay and leadership is bleak. Getting stuff done here is very difficult but again, work life is great and people are nice."
good,Good working experience and learn new technology.it is also nice working with AMEX. They strictly follow Agile Methodology and the QA are given enough of flexibility to work without any pressure. best experience to work on continues Integration using Jenkins where we checked it all our automation test.
good,It is okay to work for American Express if you are able to work any day anytime. they are open 24/7 including ALL holidays which isn't ideal for me to have time with my children
good,"- Challenging, growth oriented environment offering good professional and personal development opportunities"
good,Project Manager for large scale projects.  I enjoyed the culture and people at American Express.  I wish American Express offered more job security to its long standing employees.  The hiring process at a American Express is very slow and not favorable for displaced employees.
good,"Good culture, cross functional environment, global organization, respectful culture."
good,"My co-workers are great, but ever since the company went virtual, they have changed everything"
good,The hardest part of Job is that there is no motivation or appraisal for what we are doing.
good,"The company has been  rated as one of the great place to work which is really true , the company policies are very employee friendly."
good,"I would be told the night before by my boss, Georgia, what the plan of attack was for the following day. She had me in charge to get things started because she trusted my judgement. Considering the job was art related and I was an art student, she felt as if I were an asset to the company. "
good,AMEX is overall a nice place to work. Everyone participates is their work from home program.
good,"Very good place to have work/life balance"
good,"typical work consist of me taking calls from American Express elite clientele, consulting with clients to determine travel needs, listening to unspoken cues from clients, given respective feedback, working under pressure to get high demand clients request fulfilled in addition to assisting co workers who need assistance. There are many obstacles with my job in which I love because I love challenges and everyday is a new and different day. I enjoy booking travel and  assisting clients with their request."
good,"Worked for AmEx Travel about 3 years. Employees on the floor for the most part were wonderful/insightful. Some direct supervisors work great, but others were vindictive and manipulated some of our stats for their benifit. "
good,It is fun to work in Amex as the working environment is cool. There is one to one interaction between management and employee. You can give your views and tell them the issues you are facing.
good,9 to 5 at a business center wearing a headset all day and being timed while leaving your desk.  Nice co-workers.
good,"Management talks a good game, but most decisions are made to favor them and not the common employee! Money is often shifted and used for things that they aren't needed for instead of raises and better bonuses and things to help the employees stay motivated. Moral is often low due to no work life balance."
good,"Amex is not a bad company to work for, nor is it a great one for my personal goals and aspirations. A typical day at work involves showing up ready to get work done just like any other job, and I've learned a lot about practices and terms in the finance profession. This company is for people already settled in their life that just requires job security and a decent paycheck to go along with it. The opportunities to grow are there, however, it is much slower paced and less adaptive than, say the newer tech companies with a west-coast management style."
good,"American Express was an excellent environment to refine my professionalism as well as my presentation and communication skills.  The company helped me to think more strategically in my approach to solving business problems and work efficiently in a company where extensive alignment with cross-functional teams was required.  It also provided me with extensive people leadership and consultative selling skills.  My time at American Express has provided me with the confidence and ability to operate independently as well as a clear understanding of what it takes to generate measurable financial results."
good,"Your pretty much a number. Great benefits and pay but thats how they lure you in, great group of people. Managers are lazy and hate dealing with escalation calls. Only care about numbers and not the employee"
good,"This is your typical 9-5 and the work/life balance is incredible. Great benefits and great comp, the only complaint is that there was little/no mobility unless there's a restructure. If you're looking for a flexible, well-organized corporate job, this is it."
good,American Express being a large international company offers good opportunities to develop skills in various part of the business and countries.
good,My role is to serve external cardholders from all over the world in disputes they have with Merchants over the telephone. This involves evaluating the customers claim to see if we have the right to represent them against the Merchant. Collating the correct evidence to prove the cardholders claim and conversing with the Merchant to come to an amicable solution.
good,Not so great if you are seeking upward mobility or promotional opportunities. You would be a cog in the works and easily overlooked. Making waves is a double edged sword because you can get noticed or you can get to be part of the next lay off if you rock the wrong boat.
good,"Majority of Management was great, great co-workers, job was constantly changing so you have to be very flexible and willing to learn new things."
good,Great customer service oriented company. The training sessions in place prepare you for your job duties. Benefits are great.
good,"Oavsett vart man jobbar i företaget så är det en rolig erfarenhet att ha med sig. Företaget är stort och internationellt och man jobbar över flera marknader. Här finns möjligheter för befordran , jobba utomlands , jobba hemifrån och ha ett balanserat arbetsliv samt privatliv."
good,"This used to be an excellent company to work for. However after the old CEO departed and the partnership with Costco ended, things went downhill. What used to be a balanced customer service position is now hardcore, mandatory selling! The metrics are impossible to meet and it's now a dog eat dog culture. 1 or 2 cutthroat managers..."
good,"American Express is a trusted brand and great company with good work life balance initiatives.   However, leadership can be hit or miss depending on the team.   I have seen some really good Leaders and some that not so good.  Salary is on the low side, they sell you on the end of year bonus.   Job Security is minimal depending on how the business unit performs."
good,"Fun environment as you meet different people from across the world on a daily basis. Communication has to be clear as they might not understand the language  as well, so you have to be well informed and use familiar words to get the information clear enough for them to understand. Focus needed as you working with their money  and with the company's money so no room for error ."
good,"My job was an at-home position. I was in customer service for credit cards. The training was good, but I just wasn't quick enough to satisfy requirements."
good,"Es una de las mejores empresas, porque pagan bien y dan todas las prestaciones y beneficios."
good,Constant battle to get paid what I deserved.  Every new manager had a mark to make and always made reviews sound like we did not know what we were doing.
good,"Uma empresa grande e séria, plano de crescimento, mas baixos vencimentos."
good,The call center at American Express focused mostly on upselling members on the cards they had and the requirements to get the members off the phone as quickly as possible did not seem like the best way to offer great customer service.
good,"My typical day was busy, and I learned how to listen in order to make critical decisions. The management was professional and there was room for growth within the company. The culture was diverse and the hardest part of my job was dealing with costumers who was very angry. The most enjoyable part of my job was the making sure the customers issues was resolved and that they were satisfied."
good,"A typical work day included talking to high value customers about there financial accounts and advise them how to use them and what new ones they may need. This job involve open small business accounts and there were two components customer service and sales. I had some of the best really good managers at American Express, The workplace was really relaxed, but the job itself was stressful. The hardest part of the job was to talk to a customer loosing his or her business and not being able to help. The most enjoyable part of the job was the compensation and benefits."
good,"American Express was a good place to work when I started in . It was all about the employees, Amex took good care of their employees. Over the years, the company transitioned and many jobs were sent overseas, leading Amex to lay off a lot of their employees. Management changed and so a lot of things changed as well. Towards the last few years, it became difficult to trust in Amex because the job security that was once there wasn't there anymore."
good,"Busy job, stayed on the phone the entire day other than 15 minute break which is when you went to the bathroom.  No flexibility.  Management was good, training was excellent, benefits were good"
good,"Fast pace and demanding environment, results oriented.  Highly professional organization with strong focus on customer service.  Matrix hierarchy with global teams."
good,American Express is a great company with a solid future. I've joined in Aug-2016. I've enjoyed my time here and the growth opportunities that they've provided. They understand the importance of personal and professional growth as well as the importance of work life balance.
good,Working is a culture for us nowadays to learn and grow.  We learn new things in different department and we grow so much when someone teaches us even through we thought we knew everything.
good,I was really excited to start working there. they had great pay with many perks. after being there for a little over a year things turned for the worst. they changed their short term disability company and made some less desirable company changes. I mostly had decent managers and they do have decent training. it is corporate level who have lost the feel for the people working at the lower levels and not realizing how important they are. And then the losing of the Costco partnership really hurt the company as a whole.
good,Productive and fun environment with a terrific fitness center.  Great benefits and supportive management.  I enjoyed my position very much
good,"My job at Amex is to add functionality according to the new user story's and fix the bugs. Apart from that I will be building POC's to display the capabilities of the API'S which the backend guys have built. I have seen the new concept of Hateo's which provides links for the navigation from the backend response itself. My toughest day was when I faced a cross browser issue in IE which was given to me my second day. The issue has not been resolved from 2 months.by the team since its a peculiar. The issue resolves it self if developer tool bar is open and continues to come when tool bar is closed. I solved it in 2 days with a time stamp in my service request.My co-workers are awesome. I receive good instructions from my lead."
good,American Express has a great work life balance as most work from home 2 days a week.  Organizational changes are constant which make it difficult to bond with team members or be promoted.  Networking is the key to success here.  All in all not a bad company to work for.
good,They provide excellent benefits. Schedule flexibility is based on seniority and business needs so you can be hired for the night and weekend shift thinking you may get a better schedule but may not be able to until they do a realignment and sometimes that's not but every 2 years or more. Performance metrics are easy to meet for most people but some find it difficult.
good,"High paced, high stress environment.  The hardest part of the job was politics within the customer service arena between co-workers as well as management.  I did learn that over and above the politics there is always a way to work together for the goals set as a team.  The most enjoyable part of the job involves the clients.  Helping them resolve the issues that led them to take time out of a usually very busy day to actually call in.  Making myself aware they felt this wasn't an issue to resolve in house or through our website. Knowing the client was aware customer service representatives for American Express were well trained, engaged and knowledgeable. That is the kind of representative the client can depend on to get the job done."
good,"American Express was a great place to work, I just wish their Management was on the same page in the Australia/New Zealand department."
good,American Express is a good company that provides a good work life balance. The leadership is very good and I have enjoyed working for them in various positions.
good,Nice atmosphere to work in. Managers easy to get along with.
good,Was intending to retire with the Company intil thay announced they were closing the center due to company restructuring.
good,"The rules seemed to change based on your team leader. I felt as if I was mislead during training regarding what to expect for shift bids, bonuses and etc. Amex is a great company but the HBS department needed helped. The technical issues were tiring."
good,"Hard to get anything done due to numerous meetings. Compensation is decent, but environment is literally just like the movie Office Space."
good,Strick company and very professional environment. I did not enjoy working there because of the hours. The compensation was great but you have to be dedicated.
good,Colleagues were wonderful to work with.
good,The work day was extremely fast paced and sometimes counter-productive.  Resources were spread thin and many times work flow is interrupted by someone not being available to perform a task you needed to proceed.  Employees sometime held their work secretive and were often not willing to reveal everything that you needed to perform your tasks.  There is a bit of a language barrier that sometimes caused delay and misunderstanding.
good,"- Prospecção de novos clientes;"
good,Il y a toujours de la vente lié au travail quelque soit le département.
good,"The companies schedules, were unable to encompass my school schedules, back then, in the 1980 s.  I was a full time student, and I worked full time, it was more important to get as much, of my education, finished as possible."
good,"American Express provides a lot of intense training and is always progressing, they do expect a lot and operate an unreasonable Refer To Friend scheme to which your bonus is connected"
good,"I did written and telephone salary and benefit surveys to ensure that American Express was competitive."
good,Mucho trabajo en equipo y un ambiente de trabajo agradable
good,"Decision making is very slow, and it is hard to advance your career.  Constant re-orgs make career development difficult.  "
good,"Good for Freshers. Working in shift timings. India's no. 2 in terms of best workplace. Good experience for Freshers. Best shift timings. Good infrastructure, cafeteria."
good,Answer incoming calls and provide customer service help them with there questions regarding their bill. transfer calls if needed.Put in disputes if a customer does not agree with what is on their statement.
good,"This is an employee friendly company employee can easily balance his or her work life."
good,Job pays well but you will work for that money.  You are expected to take WHATEVER the customers dish out.  Insurance Benefits SUCK!  Management has no clue but expect you to perform.
good,"making repetitive calls to customers to collect payments that are in areas. The job itself wasn't the best, but the people were the best part of it. i have been able to apply some key skills to my everyday life thanks to my role. the workplace culture is fun, productive and positive. the hardest part of the job is making those difficult calls to the customers however the most enjoyable part is when a customer thanks you for your professionalism and being genuine about your job."
good,"Learnt a lot in terms of credit cards industry, excellent place to work for in terms of incentives and teams and other benefits. Although career progression is a bit challenging."
good,"Jobs are being lost because the company rather save a dollar more and out source them to cheaper labor in India and Philippines. Customers are not happy and the company doesn't care about it, they rather save extra money, rather than listen to their customers. Which ultimately they will end up losing in the long run because of this decision making. They release employees who have put their hearts and souls into this company for many years, and they are just laying them off."
good,"previous work, why I was leaving, and what I will bring to the company. the comapny is good but management sucks, and health insurance has a very very high decuctable"
good,"Excellent work place and accommodation/ Amenities. Great people to work with, excellent incentives/ Bonuses. Great Boss/ Management."
good,"Great environment if you just want to plug in and get a job done.  If you want to make a difference, this is NOT the place for you.  Unless you are a VP (they are very top heavy in VPs by the way), you don't really have a say in what happens on a day to day basis.  The company is very vocal about peer reviews and surveys to make the working environment more appealing to all stages (entry-level up to senior management) of your career."
good,"I enjoyed my time with American Express. The benefits are AMAZING, however commission structure and sales quota are outrageous."
good,"prise d'appels , renseignements sur les assurances, validation contrat, suivi de dossier, administation, relance clientèle, fidélisation, horaire décalée, travail équipe, challenge, recompense de résultat chaque fin année, repas avec collaborateur fin année..."
good,"Proprietory work environment. Fun, good learning environment"
good,This was a fun place to work but often consisted of staying really late after a shift ended to re-stock the shelves.
good,"The company is a marketing powerhouse, with lots of innovation for its size."
good,"Each day is full of new learning and opportunity to grow and excel our expertise. "
good,Nice place to work
good,As a contractor I was impressed by the opportunities for advancement (and permanent hire status).
good,"Like any large organization, it likely depends on which business unit you are in. My business unit has frequent organizational changes and leadership does not drive top down but rather hopes for lower levels to develop strategy and push it up. This creates a ""foundering"" atmosphere where no one works effectively. The recent CIO moved on after being at Amex for less than a year. He came into Amex promising innovation and left after what I believe was being faced with the reality of the organization - it really doesn't want to be innovative and much of its technology is so tied to IBM that being innovative would be difficult if not impossible."
good,"American Express trained me to render the Quality Service to the Customer at any level."
good,Een organisatie dat de krachten van haar werknemers goed benut. Zelfontplooiing is bij American Express meer dan mogelijk!
good,Pretty much I loved working there and it was devastating and huge life change to have my career ripped out from under me. So beware they are a corporate company that only cares about cheap labor outside of our country.
good,Good work life balance at the company. Was under a good manager. A typical day at work would consist of 8 hours of work wher initially we would do our tasks and at the end of day we would have calls with NY team to take updates etc.
good,"nice place to work. but had a large turn over of employee. it was hire, train, fire. but other than that American Express is a nice Company to work for."
good,"I was employed in American Express for a short duration of time which I fulfilled my duties as required."
good,Possibly the best paying telephone customer service job. All the staff go through a meticulous hiring process and are usually all really nice people.
good,"customer service make sure every customer is happy"
good,"CCSG (Consumer card service group) targets individual customers in the U.S. markets. CCSG is responsible for developing, marketing and servicing all aspects of charge and lending card products of American Express in the United States. CCSG services are grouped according to customer status, i.e. existing card members, new card members, or card members eligible for an upgrade.  CCSG offers services to three financial streams namely: Credit Cards, Charge Cards and Partner Cards. OPEN Cards targets for Corporate/Business cards."
good,"Flexible scheduling"
good,Enjoyable place to work with great management.
good,"Super bonne entreprise, culture américaine, attention avec le service recouvrement, grand turn-over, pas bien payée et travail surveillée, chaque appels est chronométré"
good,"i love working with the current organization because I get something new to learn everyday. "
good,american express company is verry critical for us.its because it is money changer for the american citizen people .they dont have injoyable happend in that company.verry strict d management.
good,American Express is a great place to work if you don't mind a total lack of job security.  The get rid of whole groups continuously.  Immediate supervisors are fantastic but the company does mov e very slow to make decisions.
good,"American Express was by far one of the best companies I have worked for, the culture within the company and quality.of employees bar none the best around.  It has absolutely the best work life balance I have had."
good,its a very good company and all of the workers or employees try to do their best than any other company and especially there aren't anywords to talk about
good,It’s a good company I learned a lot from that client I learned many thing from project manager I thought of continuing with this company  we are unable to do .
good,Typical day at work was out going great co-workers management was always there to help
good,"American express is indeed one of the best company to work with. Its my first company, I have learned a lot from here. Work that I do in my team has become monotonous so i need an change. Since i am that stage of my career where i can take risks as well as can do as much as possible that is why i want exposure in my life and want to try something interesting."
good,I was able to move around within the company and build on my job skills. I was given every opportunity to succeed.  All the managers were easy to work with and built a good team environment.
good,"Desarrolle un nivel de liderazgo amplio, logre enriquecer el vocabulario para atender a clientes."
good,"the people that worked at American Express are lovely and really make a person's day, only problem was the long hours and demanding private corporate clients"
good,They don’t like Puerto Rican or Italian Americans because I was born in the USA. I have a brain injury and was treated as a dumb person. Often worked with inep bosses or people who did nothing for work all day.
good,"fast corporate environment with a aim to be the best with an American attitude, a good team and you felt professional working there and gave good opportunities.....if you are a yes person and take on the American dream you ll go far"
good,"This was just difficult at the time with the ages of my children. They required me to work alot of hours. They are no longer American Expresss Financial Advisors, the are now Ameriprise Financial Advisors and that is why I went to work for Don Rutledge."
good,"people are great type of work is great just that management is not their strong suite, your a family and you will have a great time, i have learnt alot how to be more independent and gain knowledge of saber travel tools to issue tickets. what to do in crisis of weather storm and how to get people to destinations."
good,"much competitiveness among employees rather than team work"
good,"I was employed part time as a collections specialist. I was recruited during my time as an MBA student. The company has many departments were you have lots of flexibility and opportunity to cross train howler collections is not one of them. This is the most dead end career path I have ever seen, which is surprising as all the other areas are filled with opportunity."
good,"Learned more about Architecture solutions,"
good,"I worked at American Express as a Corporate Travel Consultant in Dearborn,MI. Breaks and lunch times changed daily depending on what is call volume. i worked from 12:30PM-9:00 PM MON-FRI. You have to adhere to break and lunch times at least 95% of the time or else it counts against you. For Example; If your lunch is scheduled at 4:10PM and you get stuck on a call and don't get done with call until 4:30PM, then it counts against you. Same goes for breaks. Team average time was set to approx 95 % adherence. I enjoyed working with coworkers but it was very rare that we would have the same lunch and break times. Salary was good. Benefits were ok. Company very stricked on agents who had long call handle times,and agents who were not averaging at least 53-55% Hotel bookings per month. Always had problems with software systems and constantly had to call techinical support team in India for help."
good,Es una buena empresa solo que maneja bajos sueldos.
good,it was a good place to work.  I really have no more to say than that. I enjoyed some of the people that I worked with and I had great managers and it was a nice atmosphere/
good,great place to work for young ambitious career minded people who do not demand a healthy work life balance. Drive was too far from where I lived. but I did get a lot of support from management.  Training is great.
good,"The day was fun and motivated by incentives, and now it is stressful and Amex is always finding loopholes to not give performance incentives. Slave factory."
good,"Excelente para unas vacaciones, no mas tiempo. "
good,"The problem with Amex is that there is a huge disconnect between Business team & Technology teams."
good,"Un día típico de trabajo cada quien se encontraba realizando llamadas."
good,"calling people for past due bills and trying to collect. Did not like the environment and the people were not friendly. Did not like trying to get money from people when they said they did not have it, but I did even though it made me feel bad."
good,Company expected its financial planners to develop and find all clients. Company closed branch.
good,A typical day at American Express was okay....as long as you did your work and depending on who your supervisor was....just like any other call center.
good,"Pressure, No work balance life , Stressful, Good learning for fresher in sales. Huge target where completing it was a very difficult."
good,Nice experience with pros and cons and it was a nice exp working at american express but things are only good at start but not so good some are good and some are not
good,"its a wonderful job to have, but you can barely manage living a nightlife.  The pay is ok if you work crazy overtime, job security is pretty solid if you follow the rules job advancement is very little, job culture is supposed to be a family environment somedays it feels great and then its days when you dont want to be there, Management is not friendly at all"
good,"Review notarized documents for acceptance"
good,"The facilites at amercican express are first class. The management is hit and miss. It is great to work in brighton, especially during the summer months !"
good,It's a good however the path and vision currently adopted for the cost cutting is pushing it down from its peak position. The management should be supportive and be empathetic however both the traits are getting diminished
good,"A typical day at work was very busy managing the calendars, Printing documents for the manager's meetings, Creating presentation, Coordinated Offsite Meeting along breakfast, lunch, dinners with a fun environment for all attendees to enjoy themselves, answering phone calls, processing T&E, make travel reservation, hotel accommodation, ground transportation etc."
good,"You will get exposure to new technologies, latest software used and workload will too much based on the project."
good,"it was a job, i never saw it as more than just a job to report too. Paid time off was good though. Maternity leave for both parents was also a plus. The brown nosing was too much however."
good,This was an Intern position and I did not get to work with any individuals in the company as this was a project I did through my university.
good,Amex has an environment that allows for employees to cultivate themselves and the company. The work life balance has been key.
good,"At American Express, I am responsible for addressing customer requests and concerns in a prompt and timely manner. Extending offers for products and services to card members that meet their needs, and built personal relationships with card members while promoting the brand."
good,"i would go to work, take phone calls for 8 hours from customers wanting all forms of travel arranged."
good,"A typical day at work was all about chasing customer payments, sending them account statements, keeping immaculate records on the systems, data protection, liaising with travel agents and collating spread-sheets for sales team on top clients payment performance."
good,I liked working for American Express but sometimes the pressure and the stress got to be to much.
good,It overall good experience. Learned different processes customized to American Express technologies in a friendly and competitive environment.
good,Lots of nepotism and cronyism at this establishment. Employees have worked here for years with not a lot of college graduates in director positions. Needs housecleaning of lifers here.
good,"I worked at this company for at least year. i really enjoyed it at firs, but very unorganized and not stimulating for growth. i found myself dreading my job  which i loved. im not the type of person to settle for something i don't lie you may enjoy it . give it a try ."
good,"The culture at Best Company is by far the greatest asset. You can tell that they truly care about the happiness of their employees. It's a really relaxed and calm environment, even though the work we do can be fast paced. I don't dread coming into work on Monday mornings and the managers are extremely patient and understanding."
good,"Always exciting to work with this team and look forward to work with some of them again in future assignments. "
good,"Great company to work for, great benefits!! Still need to implement a more modern work culture and better chances to move up. As well more opportunities to grow within the company."
good,"THIS WAS BACK IN INDIA MIGHT NOT BE RELEVANT IN CANADA."
good,"Limited things to learn, but a good place to start. Management does not care about your suggestions at all."
good,"A Typical day at work starts with organizing and maintaining a complex calendar using a high level of integrity. Working alongside other executive assistants to prioritizing what is meaningful and urgent. "
good,Culture is very diverse if you know what I mean  Very hard to advance if you don't know people. Every years big cuts. Training is available. Some flexibility too.
good,"I didn't stay because I received another job offer with a much higher rate of pay and a better work schedule. I remember that there were vendors that took far too long to reach the customer to provide roadside assistance and some who never answered their phone when we called to request assistance. We had no control over those circumstances. I even had a couple of vendors that never showed up for the customer, leaving us with an upset and angry customer. It would have been helpful to have GPS because some customers are really not able to provide good directions to where their vehicle was located."
good,It was a unique job for me. I gave me an opportunity to look at what I've been doing for years from a consulting standpoint. And they had a nice working environment and the people were nice.
good,"Call center- very stressful. Scripts for every call. Knowledge of Sabre system very important. hours can be long depending on your last call."
good,"The hardest part about this job is the monthly goals. You only get credit for sales you initiated, so a lot of the time you are working on someone else's reservation. They have too many sales goals that you have to meet. The benefits are really great and you get PTO from day 1. It's very hard to move into other positions because other employees have higher tenure. I started in the Platinum travelers but wanted to move into cruises. They offered training to new hires but didn't allow current employees to utilize the cruise training."
good,Aggressive management with little tolerance and consideration for personal problems. Personnel does little to support employees. Middle management was unfriendly and non-supportive.
good,"Very busy workday, IBM took over american express it Dept"
good,"Well established and managed company with friendly atmosphere "
good,"Decent place to work"
good,I was responsible for engaging current/prospective customers selling financial solutions such as creditcards products and services through outbound calls
good,"A typical day at work would be very busy. Especially when flights were delayed, cancelled or when systems went down. Management would coach you often and most co-workers were really helpful."
good,"Days can be long and hours mixed, but co-workers are at hand to help, roles can be a mix of all types, not all phone based. Lots of maagers on hand to help/advise."
good,"En Querétaro la supervisión era por alguien prepotente y que insultaba a la gente, buscaban vender a toda costa sin importarles la calidad de lo que se prospectaba, tristemente la marca vale mucho, y la gente que la representaba en Querétaro la opacaba."
good,"Different manager has totally different styles and some of them are lack of management training."
good,I used to do full time accounting over there. the job started getting monotonous and I didnt think this was something I wanted to pursue my entire life so I decided to move on.
good,Atypical day at work is monotonous. There is no fun and excitement. You are always at a pressure to outdo the previous best performance. There is no appreciation for the hard work. There is also no job security.
good,"Good company overall to work for.  They train very well, and you will know how to do your job. Advancement however is difficult unless you are in the right click. No longer is hitting your target numbers enough to advance.  You need to schmooze with VPs until you get liked enough to move up.  Probably not any different than any other large corporation."
good,"Amex is rotating culture.  You are expected to change jobs every 18-24 months.  People rarely get promoted in role and must look for another group/department/division for the next level of responsibilities.  This process feels like you are back in b-school. Endless coffee chats, networking , etc…"
good,"This is a job that it is very hard to advance at, not to mention the unit supervisors arent really paid as they should be."
good,"I sold personal card membership to customers and led a team of six sales people.  As the department and staff were new, the management  was not very sure  what to do with us.  The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with the many prospects everyday."
good,"Stressful environment. Great supervisors and co workers. shift work, always changing,  working weekends and some holdays. constant changes, moving of depts to other sites"
good,Amex is a company that values intelligence. Casual atmosphere mostly. Management were professional.
good,Its been great to work with American Express. I got alot learning from this company as it was my first job.
good,"Amex is a great place to work and the senior leadership is very respectable, but many lower-level people leaders in the organizations are not strong and do not get the proper coaching. On several occasions, downright poor leaders have been promoted up the ranks, to the shock of their direct reports."
good,"No work life balance. No proper relations maintained by the leadership.  Good place to learn technologies. "
good,There is no work life balance. The hours are horrible. The turnover rate speaks for itself. The employees totally depend on eachother coming into work because of how depressing the job is.
good,People are proud of their job. A lot of services are moving to Canada or South America. Good teamwork.  A lot of positions are disappearing. Jobs moved to other countries.
good,Amex has a strong brand and culture.  The company provides a solid foundation to grow your career.  The company promotes work/life balance and allows employees the opportunity to develop in their roles.
good,"A typical day at Amex for me was listening to cardholder's concerns, anticipating their needs/wants and succinctly taking care of their needs and reminding them of the great benefits of the card(s) they had. I learned how to diffuse situations, quickly review and assess profiles/accounts, comprehend all the disclosures and teach the customer's how to get the most out of their cards in an easy to understand verbiage. The workplace culture was something that Amex leadership tried really hard to always improve and to meet everyone where they were. The leadership was empowered and they passed that empowerment down to their teams. The hardest part of the job were the angry customers who really just wanted to yell at someone or the customer's who did understand how their benefits worked and those who did not know how to use the internet. It was very difficult to try and teach the individuals who did not want to be taught. The most enjoyable part of the job was the pay check. :) I enjoyed seeing my bonuses from good surveys and it made always try to turn the phone call around."
good,"This is a really great place as a fresh grad. as the salary is a bit higher compared to others and they provide lots of benefits. However, you will need to give up your social time as well as weekends and nights. Expect to work odd hours and do repetitive desk work. Management focuses more on how the are perceived by others rather than dealing with internal employees concerns. They provide a lot of benefits to make employees shut up and to overlook the fact that most of them are operational roles and play a very front end -executive role with very low ability to grow."
good,Great people and culture.  Many highly motivated intelligent employees looking to deliver value for the customers and the company.  Limited upward mobility.
good,"Different teams used multiple project management approaches and there was poor communication that stemmed from senior leadership of the different teams."
good,"Stressful for sure. Great training program but the work flow is constant with little to no downtime. You have to have a thick skin, you have to be able to deal with angry people all day long."
good,Diversity was usually code for visa labor. Sometimes encouraged us to write our legislators about key legislation. Outsourcing of HR meant no one is fixing problems that can benefit the work environment.
good,"A place where it is all about constant learning. It is a pretty diverse workplace and with this you get to learn a lot of new things such as inclusion. Overall, a great place to be."
good,"Typical day was working with merchants and customer about credit card disputes, pulling data logs, etc."
good,"I worked for American Express for 15 years and took great pride in the company.  "
good,la cultura que promueve en cuanto a compromiso al cliente es muy buena pero las personas que lo coordinan no son tan afables a la filosofìa.
good,"Amex has changed a lot over the last several years.  The employee use to be the most valued asset.  This is  no longer the case.  Amex is making a number of changes to be more competitive, but they have a number of challenges & no vision on what the destination looks like."
good,"I am taking calls regarding anything from changing address, billing dispute, sending out cards, selling additional products and services.  its high call volume and our goals are harder all the time.  things change all the time.  we are measured on efficiencies and need to take about 14 calls an hour.  measured on surveys from the customer also."
good,"AMEX is big and complex.  They successfully integrated technology and UX into their culture butt there are still some kinks to work out."
good,Sometimes there is a lack of job security. Hardest part of the job is taking calls back to back without room to breathe in between. You also have to be prepared to get failing survey ratings from Card Members whether it is your fault or not that they didn't like their experience. It does affect your pay.
good,"American Express is overall a great company to work for. The benefits were great and management at the company was also good overall. "
good,"I liked the development side and training you go through, career advancement is discussed from the beginning. With the right manager you can go far in this company."
good,It was ok while it lasted. Need more professional managers. The environment in which working at the workstation was not clean enough to work. Better managers.
good,"Nice place to work. The atmosphere is very bright and the culture is distinct.  Work life balance is a struggle."
good,"It was a 8 hour work day. My day began with checking the email adress and answer to Amex clients e solve any problems that apear. "
good,Work environment is okay. Great colleagues. The company provides great benefits and tries to accommodate work life balance by providing onsite daycare
good,"el día típico es muy agotador."
good,Its a good company where in you can learn a lot from your leaders. I joined this company in 2011 and till date every day is a new learning. You learn to maitain relations and priorities as work.
good,"It seems like anyone who is promoted to a VP in this company, there first order of business is not to find out what's wrong or what they can do better for the business it's to rename the dept. and/or products with the same processes and procedures that were done before.  It's a company that you can grow in however, you have to ""sell your soul"" for advancement."
good,Once you raise up a couple levels the work/life balance is much better. The Entry level positions have been known to not have much flexibility.
good,UK shift with shift maximum ending time is 3am as per UK timing. Fun place to work in. Well organized & supportive co-workers.
good,"Starting off the day with a strong cup of coffee and discussing the tasks with the colleagues, working as a team and helping each other in boosting over all performances."
good,"I loved American express, but I hated the politics there.  There are stories of people how important they are, etc, then two days later they're gone, desk empty: GONE"
good,Found it hard to get promoted and has only emphasis on work. No work life balance as a typical operations company. It was the responsible of the employees to create a good working culture
good,"Hubo dos períodos..uno bueno y uno no tan bueno.-"
good,overall a great place to work if only the management had any real people skills whatsoever you'd think a customer service based company would be more in-tuned with their employees and not just their clients
good,Great management. Work very hard. Scope is truly in a multinational environment. Results focus.
good,"Great Company However Looking to Expand my work Experience. Typical day consist of handling incoming calls and assisting customers with account information such as balances, available credit and taking payments..The job itself is not hard however there are surveys that are beyond your control. I definitely enjoy speaking to the customers from all parts of the world Since working their I will admit I take Customer Service very serious when giving and receiving it."
good,"This company is good to work for. A typical day at work would be filled with collection phone calls, fun and excitement. Great management, good coworkers."
good,"Great company, strong brand, extremely political."
good,Answering calls and fulfilling all aspects of travel requests from company employees. Dealing with all problems and challenges that arise.
good,Large company with great values. It takes many years to move up in this company. The wait is worth it.
good,Good place to work and grow. One can gain a lot of exposure as their target clients are HNI Consumers.
good,"this was a work from home position with great benefits and a fast paced day.  Management was all available via messenger or email, sometimes by phone.  I never should have left"
good,"relaxed timing, good work culture, good serniors, good tech stack, good environment.relaxed environment, good leaders, standup culture, broad spectrum of users."
good,"Overall, the company is great, and the culture is very positively different than other financial firms. However, there are some senior leaders that are passive aggressive so know the team you're signing up to be on."
good,Not enough sources to complete the job and no training. I would like to learn jobs in all departments but we are very limited in our field and cost issues.
good,"Very Good. Work life balance is good here, The pay is good. Amazing work culture and office environment. Overall the place has employee satisfaction initiatives that helps in engaging employees and best place to work."
good,I started as a consultant and was eager to become a full-time employee.  I value my time with the company and encourage other people to look for an opportunity with them.
good,"Dealing with customers when travel plans fall through will be very stressful, but the pay makes up for it. Typically take about 15 calls a day and usually have to do a lot of searching around and comparing prices for customers who generally do not appreciate the effort you give"
good,"It was a good place to work. The work load is heavy, but you have the support of your team and mangers. I believe the work home life balance was good as well."
good,"Knowning that American express is one of the biggest companies in the world, they should hire a direct recruiters for them not for an RPO set up. they should also know specific strategies on how to source people to meet the requested requisitions. hoping that they use the word ""not an amex way!"""
good,"Welcoming and cooperative work culture "
good,They will pay you well so expect the same out of you. Incentives are amazing and that is the only motivation that will keep you going. If you are an under-performer then you might lose it as well.
good,It has been an awesome learning and development opportunity.The volume of clientele is very high as well as the demands on time. Time management is key to success.
good,"American Express is awesome. I enjoy the brand and the culture. Their major downfall is poor management depending on the department you work in. I worked in two different departments and the management styles are night and day. One department had the flexibility, was willing to work with you, and at least appeared happy to help. The other department was not at all flexible, unwilling to assist in work life balance, and ran the department as a dictatorship. Good luck finding a balance between the two."
good,"Implemented a REST API together with great team members."
good,"Call center strictness with schedule adherence was too much for me. The manager changes were too often and some of the managers had threatening behaviors like putting you on the spot in front of your peers when you didn't do anything wrong. Like your phone isnt working right, but you get written up for underperforming,  even when you reported the issue several times to management"
good,"I worked in one of the call centers for American Express, and for me, the day-to-day operations of the position were not hard at all. The only issue with working for the company in one of their call centers is dealing with the impatience of some of the cardholders, that would be the only con about this job."
good,I worked there as a contractor but it was very fast paced and the work was challenging.  Management was good but changes often from the top down.  The pay is very competitive and it is a very collaborative environment.
good,i would assist customers with there travel package i would book flight hotels and car with great customer service the management could have been better the hardest part is when you cant assist a customer as of getting there money back or canceling a reservation that is non refundable  the best part about the job is when you book a hotel reservation its a bonus and when you can book the customer a cheep vacation or business trip
good,Amex is one of the best organization to work for in the valley. The technology organization is always looking to  innovate and is the leader compared to its competitors.
good,"good pay, good benefits they do like to outsource...so be careful. they recognize for performance not just time with company. but having to always change schedules was hard"
good,"I enjoyed it, great place to learn finance, regulations and compliance measures. Enjoyed the team chemistry, structure and more ownership within cases"
good,"Its good to work, have good staff. And would love to work. All new technologies AMEX adopts so its good environment or place to learn and earn.Its good to work, have good staff.."
good,Taking inbound calls from merchants with adding and removing charges on customers accounts. I also updated changes to customers accounts and order products for customers.
good,"Call times were very unrealistic, greeting the customer and solving the issue within 3 minutes of saying hello was just not feasible most of the time. It was very stressful. Good pay and benefits"
good,"Amazing work place for improving in professional career ,is a place to recommend every one . Fellow workers and boss at different project was cooperative .Never feel any stress at all ."
good,"Amex Middle East is a good starting point , if you are venturing forth in your career as American Express is a Great Brand name in the UAE Marketplace."
good,"Buen ambiente laboral y remuneración acorde. "
good,"Very enjoyable place to work. Great working environment with friendly and hard-working employees. As an intern, I felt valued and was working on meaningful projects."
good,"They have fantastic pay for the position you're in, and they teach you interesting and engaging utility of modern technology mixed with legacy fundamentals. I've learned quite a bit while AmEx while getting paid more than fairly - I'd recommend a stretch here to whomever may be reading this!"
good,Calls with customers were reviewed and each Customer Care Agent had at least 1 call reviewed with management each week. Calls that had errors were reviewed and could cause loss of commissions
good,"Great place to learn, challenging environment, allows you to excel your strength.."
good,American Express is a good place to work but there are constant changes resulting in inconsistency in job security. They often lay off employees  in the name of reorganization.
good,Strong brand. clear direction and growth potential. varied management cultures and styles lead to wide ranging work environment and career advancement.
good,Environment can be a little confusing. Information is never straightforwardly given. Promotions can be based on who you know not what you know. I had many experiences where direct leaders were clueless as to the common objective of the business.
good,We had a great small team separate from the Business consultants which made it easier to communicate and bond. We had a good client base and the consultants we knowledgeable and happy to share information. Unfortunately management was very inflexible when it came to salary reviews and promotions and therefore lost a number of valuable and dedicated staff.
good,I would talk to travel agents and sell packages to them.  I learned about many destinations that we represented and even got to go and visit some places both in the US and abroad.  I would have stayed with this company but it was a temporary job and I think that I really missed teaching.
good,Promises of advancement by management only to have posts filled by incompetent fools who drove the team down.  Also felt like a dog on a leash having to account (and often getting scorned for) going to restroom.
good,"Good place to work. Many opportunities."
good,Nice work culture. Pleasant working environment with seasonal fluctuation in work load. Good incentive programs. High perks of working in the captive unit.
good,The position was fun - but the pay was not very good.  I was able to freely give ideas and received constructive feedback.  I was able to go to my supervisor with any question or concern and not fear retribution.
good,In a typical day the overall atmosphere is great. Full of fun and expectations but it fells good to do your job make money and have fun while doing it.
good,"If you excite around change management & transitional change this is the company for you."
good,"A typical day included meetings and reviews.  Running reports, problem solving, working with peers on projects.  The hardest part of the job was bridging the gap between the needs of the contracting company and American Express."
good," Assist Hong Kong and Singaporean based expatriates in Credit and Charge Card related inquiries and issues."
good,"Reforcé mis conocimientos en ventas y finanzas."
good,"Working in the travel industry is a great experience.  Good pay, lots of travel opportunities.  Benefits were typical, vacation time, health insurance."
good,"I've been gone for too many years to give a review for the current atmosphere.  I've heard there is still a lot of outsourcing and now that the CEO has stepped down, it seems to be in flux."
good,Good benefits.  Good work life balance.  Management needs to provide better strategic direction and alignment across business groups to keep groups moving together for the common goal.
good,Great place to work. At the time i worked there there were great opportunities for bonuses and overtime. Great benefits. Co workers and management were great.
good,"Young Management lacked the skills to do their job and had to push their weight around to look good. No sustenance. Could not handle others with less rank pointing out their ignorance. Plus, the company is restructuring and sending American Jobs to India."
good,stort företag med bra produkter med roliga kollegor.
good,Amex is very great organization.  Amex has a ton of perks within it's location.  The biggest area of opportunity is a comprehensive strategy for promotion and development for the one that want it.
good,"Freelanced here and the company doesn't exist anymore, I think."
good,I have to say I learned so much from this job. the company is a good company but some of the managers take things personal and rule according to flavors
good,"A typical day at work started with the morning meeting where the manager sets the expectations for the day, discusses the details of the progress of the month."
good,"Metas accesibles y buen ambiente laboral, administracion de tiempos flexible"
good,Had to work a lot of hours and position was never clearly defined. Company provided a lot of benefits and retirement plans were great. Insurance and vacation time was fantastic.
good,"A good working environment for upgrading skills and mental agility. "
good,Great company to work for great time interacting with clients  and colleagues  amazing benefits  overall a learning experience would highly recommend working for them
good,With this job you were on the phone with new business owners creating merchant accounts so they can accept American Express cards from their customers.
good,Challenging and rewarding.  I worked as a consultant and it was a great  experience. Wish it could give me more chances to get involved with business issues while doing the technical work.
good,"Good place to work, privately owned. in a shared office very diverse and friendly environment. Learned a great deal, about everything from money market accounts,401K, long term care. How to invest your money wissely and save for retirement"
good,"Worked in large Market Sales on the Corporate credit Card side for about 8 years. The company rewared  the top perfermers very well, but it was definetly combat pay and I left when the comp plan changed and sales territories were rearranged."
good,I really enjoyed working for Amex.  It was a fun place to work.  I made a lot of friends and enjoyed to overall perks of the job.  We had a cafeteria.  We were given the abiltity to get a free Amex card to know how the product worked.  The inital testing to get in was really tough. But once you were in they really took care of you.
good,"Vehicle and foot patrol, issuance of badges...constant computer tracking. Controlling and monitoring entrance and exit of all personnel and traffic.Escorting delivery's and visiting personnel."
good,I was only on work experience week through my college. I listened in on phone calls with customers and listened to meetings that were taking place between managers.
good,Not a bad place to work. I found the place to be well received and not too shabby a place to work for. I wish I got an extension for my project for another couple years.
good,"Agradable ambiente de trabajo"
good,"Great company, a lot of innovation. This is a great company for work life balance. The only downside here is that pay is generally lower than at counterparts."
good,"I supported a dynamic group of managers and the VP that oversaw the Credit Analysis Department. My daily tasks included answering phones, setting and confirming appointments and travel arrangements, attendance and payroll, creating presentations, reconciling expense reports and any other requests that were made of me. We were just a part of a very large group that worked together closely and regularly."
good,some of the most talented leaders and people I've ever worked with.  They cared about your performance and your value to the business and coached you to improve every day.
good,For someone who functions well at a desk job it's great! There was plenty of work to make time go by fast. There were tons of resources if there were any questions at hand. The supervisors were engaged.
good,"Good work life balance and the Company really tries to be one of the best places to work, The work environment is dynamic and the matrixed structure requires building strong relationships."
good,fue mi primera experiencia laboral  lo principal fue el trato con el cliente
good,"I really enjoyed my time at American Express. It is a great company to work for, they are constantly raising money for charity."
good,Very fast paced place to work with little or no supervision.  Very stats and numbers driven company but account focused.  Good benefit and vacation package.
good,There is never a dull day. I was particularly given the opportunity to lead challenging strategic projects with huge senior management expectations. These were great opportunities for optimal exposure to the difficult enterprise-wide issues facing the company and gaining superb personal development through the process.
good,"While AMEX is a huge, well known organization I found it to be too large for me. There was not a lot of guidance and I often felt as though I was drowning."
good,"The working environment is pretty much competitive. Sometimes its stressful depends on the project and stage of the project. Anyway, I got  A GREAT exposure working for Amex from TCS."
good,i've learned alot with this company. The company really respected the clients but not so much the customer. there was a culture there that i really enjoyed. the people made it agreat place to be at beside he annoying phone calls.
good,"One such firm where there is good work life balance, leadership is good, leaders are open to new thoughts in work process."
good,This is a company very focused on their employees. They do what they can with what they have to make you feel valued. I learned a great deal about process improvements and making yourself indispensable.
good,Selling amex product is difficult i feel.i learn to be  patient .gud management but no benefit to employers.working time is more than 8 hrs. easy to spend time
good,"I was a Marketing Analyst, i was running corporate campaign, take care of Corporate events and clear payments of agency as well. i was taking care of GCP (Global corporate payment) and GMS (Global merchant service) We had pre-execute multiple campaigns and it was succeed. I learned multiple things from seniors and colleagues managing campaigns parallel Corporate events. Hardest part of the job is follow up with stakeholder. i enjoyed to make multiple Power point slide to check on month on month basis how much revenue we had generated."
good,Good company but relatively little advancement opportunity. salaries are average. Very talented co-workers who mainly care about their jobs and work hard.
good,When I worked here it was a branch of American Express Financial Advisors.  Since then the company morphed into Ameriprise so I do not know if American Express Trust was a part of that merger.
good,"Amex receives a lot of credit for offering work like balance assistance, but this depends on your manager. My manager did not make this possible and did not allow work from home."

good,Management was not up to par with the airline business.  Over time job demand changes and they were not able to  keep up with the changes.  Quite simply they were lacking proper retraining and being progressive with the work objectives.

good,"Excellent health benefits, retirement plan, and paid vacation.  Also supportive of volunteering in the community and providing employee networking opportunities."
good,"Good Place to work No complaints all satisfactory from employee perspective. Lot of key learning from and management is good."
good,American Express was a good company to work for but there were some management issues. As a whole of you don't mind the constant go of back to back phone calls it is worth the money
good,co-workers are friendly and team players but the supervisors are somewhat incautious. the working hours and schedule are not flexible and  constantly changeable.
good,"Ambiente internazionale, con prospettive di crescita. Da questa esperienza ho appreso le logiche relativa al software SAS molto diffuso per analisi storiche."

good,"I am enjoying my work.Good support from colleagues whenever you required.You will  always new things to learn as an when required."
good,"I started with this Company in 1983 in New Jersey and was relocated to Southern California after 2 years.   While I agreed to the relocation package (guaranteed 3 year commitment), I did not like California or the work culture.   After my commitment was completed,  I resigned to return to the east coast.   I wanted to take a transfer back East, but there was no opportunity to do so."
good,Normally ten to twelve hour days cold calling potential clients and closing sales. I learned in sales you must prospect in order to stay in business. The hardest part of the job is the boiler room (dialing dialing dialing) for prospects.
good,"It was very  hard time for me when I worked here because I use to spend 50 to 60 hours per week and I had not been paid for the same."

good,"Customer service processing card payments, introducing other card products to customers. Resolving card issues with customers, participating in training."
good,I really like the group I work with in IT Operations. Everyone is highly skilled and knows their job inside and out. Service Owners care about their people but above that level everyone else seems to only care about securing their own future within American Express and are extremely disconnected on what is going on at the ground level. I believe company is what you make of it and we have fun whenever we can but never lose focus on our daily tasks that need to be completed. I have learned so much as I have worked for 6 different managers in my time at AMEX and I've tried to learn something from each one.

good,"I assisted the Director of Rehab with phones, appointments, making sure the therapists had everything they needed to do their jobs. My co-workers were great. I didn't know anything about occupational, physical or speech therapists before working at this job. The hardest part of the job was when the children died."
good,"Great company - If you get lucky with the right leadership, you will be very happy."
good,American Express is a very good company to associate with.  I believe in the direction of the current CEO and other executive leadership.  I believe in the cultural direction of the firm.

good,"I enjoyed the various roles I had at American Express and I learned many skills and grew my leadership techniques significantly. "

good,"Busy, focued, collaborative, competitive, knowledge sharing."
good,"American Express is a outstanding organization to work with, including its Diverse culture, good learning experience and overall carrier growth."
good,"Lots of different projects to work on and learn from, lean Management style (lots of autonomy), flexible approach to career advancement"
good,"Pros - "
good,entry level job until they closed the facility - but unlike what happens today - Amex hired a recruiting agency to help all employees to find jobs - people we offered to move to lower cost locations - Amex was a class act!
good,"•	Develop technical solutions to Business Problems."
good,"SFO International Airport Centurion Lounge Brand has a very layered, intricate operations with things constantly shifting daily. Long work days with various heavy travel periods in the airport."
good,It was a Tuesday to Saturday morning shift. I was in the technical support department. The management was not the best but they did what they could. Co-workers were good.

By joining the Big Data team, you’ll have the opportunity to work with one of the largest, most unique and valuable data sets in the entire world.

Management was supportive and encouraging. Co-workers and I had excellent collaboration and team building experience.  My particular job, which involved investigations of internal and external financial crimes against the company, was challenging and rewarding. The hardest part of the job was completing complex, multi-faceted annual reports that required gathering information from various sources, by the deadline dates.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with a group of diverse and supportive coworkers that helped to make our department a success."
good,"Ok place to work, very flexible schedules for vacation.  Good opportunities for advancement  but not to many incentives available."
good,"A great work environment with smart people that are fun and enlightening to work with. Great team environment with almost 2 years of agile development. Everyone worked together to build a great product. Unfortunately, the products did not make enough profit soon enough to satisfy the Amex board and they just pulled the plug on the whole thing. Everyone has 90 days. Had planned on working there longer."
good,"The typical day at American Express could be stressful, could be educational, could be a pleasure and could be all in one day.  The most important thing I learned was to customize the approach to the challenge.  The hardest part of my job was to spend the amount of time needed to provide world class service in a phone center environment.  My co-workers and I often differed in our ideas of process, and best practices, but at the end of the day we respected each other and started the next day a clean slate.  In 22 years there were many management styles to work with but all with some redeeming quality.  Focusing on the day to day servicing of the client always took priority and seemed to work into all the management strategies.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the interaction with my clients and the self-expressive element provided by my management group."
good,"No trabajé como empleado de American Express como tal, pero por el contacto que tuve con los contratados, definitivamente es una excelente empresa para trabajar."
good,"Fast pace, travel consultancy job, quick turn around of business travel clients, loved working here but travel isn't the way forward for me now."

good,I have learned the importance of matching each employee's unique skills with the proper job/task. This allows for all stakeholder's to benefit.
good,"Massive transformation going on in IT, but still needs a lot of direction and focus. Much of the management is completely out of touch and only know how to direct traffic not really concerned about the direction of the platform they support. Risk averse in a big way to a ridiculous extent. Heavy into presentations and pretty presentations, very soft on results. Everything that is a failure is rebranded a splendid success. Too many holdouts for change and still much dependent on contractors. More than 90% of the IT in this building is taken up with young Indians straight off their last assignment somewhere else."
good,"work is awesome but the timings are too late and salary increments are low."
good,Its an alright job with opportunities to move up in the company. If it were in a bigger city it would a career job. Killeen is a great place for a military family
good,"weekly goals to be made and to exceed"
good,"Working for American Express for 11 years, gave me an opportunity to enjoy working for a Company that values their clients and customers, and also supports their staff.

good,"Very 'international' workplace, allowed me to sharpen SAS programming and macro skills."
good,"Global, large place to work."
good,"AMEX used to be the best place to work now people just stress about metrics and whether your job will go overseas or not. The PTO is great, your co-workers are great but that's about it now.  Loved taking care of my customers even though upper management makes that nearly impossible with their metrics - used to be all about FCR now its get them off the phone as fast as possible."
good,"I enjoyed working with the major retail clients, managing and assisting them to grow their gift card business."

good,Nice organization to work in. Lots of freedom to contribute and make a difference. Good life work balance.
good,"Amazing company for 30 of 31 years.  Then, it began to unravel.    Started to become a culture of ""yes men"" who would sell their mother to win.  Systematically took steps to rid themselves of tenured people who were expensive.  Shipped customer service overseas as well as internal support.  Began trying to sell expensive marketing analytics, strayed from the core business, and just got too big for their britches.  Used to be possible to work extensively with other departments, but ended up competing with them for the same goal, and ignoring customer ownership boundaries.  Very sad to leave, but management had lost their integrity."
good,AmEx provided a work environment when I was able to flourish and the support team was fantastic
good,"American Express treated their employees well. I learned a lot of new skills on the computer and how to handle tough customer issues. "

good,"Direct sales agent means one to one interaction. Got confidence, selling skilled improved."
good,"Answered phones"
good,Influx of new Management priorities have shifted more to shareholders and less to the people that work there over the years.  Some of the people that work there and have worked there are quite outstanding.
good,"My typical days begins with checking three queues. Each queue has requests from our merchants for serveral different things. They made need application adjustments, new terminals, new PC tools, or general inquiries that need attention. I analyze applications for risk and approve them to be moved on to the next step in their set up of an American Express account. I also work customer service for TASQ Technoloy. (I work in the TASQ facility, but I am also a contract employee of American Express) TASQ is shipping facility for many credit/debit providers. Most of my work is systematic. I use Microsoft Office, Oracle, and many Amex databases."
good,M job was to assist not just regular American Express cardholders but what is considered high Value Card holders. They expect a different level of service and require more attentiveness. The most enjoyable about the job is knowing the card member was treated the way they are accustomed too.

good,"Great company and environment. Lovely people"
good,American Express Publishing was a great place to work. It will be missed
good,"Esta empresa tiene una gran política de cuidado hacia el empleado, fue interesante poder ver esa mirada. "
good,I have learned that if you do your job 100% with no negatives you can succeed but it is hard to do well in the company when the management is bad.  American Express brings people in with no travel experience and try to train.  The perks and pay is good but with the strictness and privacy issues concern me plus the members that call think they should be promised the world.
good,"Overall a flexible place to work - ability to find opportunities, take on new projects. A very collaborative culture although that sometimes makes decision making slow"
good,Great experience! I have learned a lot and meet some amazing people.

good,AMEX is a great company to work for. They take care of their employees with fantastic benefits  and better then average pay.
good,Worked with clients to maximize their financial position.
good,"Overall this company was a good company to work for. I only hit a wall when I started asking about their tuition reimbursement program. I got the cold shoulder pretty much. I got the feeling something was wrong with the company after a lot of higher ups started getting laid off. Not long after that they closed our call center in Greensboro, NC. Not sure if they knew it was going to happen and that's why no one followed up with me about the tuition program. But its not a bad company. I learned a lot"
good,It is an inbound call center. You take calls and help clients with there travel needs. The hardest part of the job is knowing every destination because that is what the clients expect. The most enjoyable part of the job are the incentives you get from the vendors and the contests that the company holds about once a month. The clients can be great. I have a list of my own that call me all the time to book there travel. I learned a lot from the job. I learned a lot about the world. I have even added places to my bucket list to see because I didn't know they existed.

good,Pride in saying employed by AMEX - big corporate environment can be daunting and overwhelming - strict structure enforced

good,fun to work
good,La califico como muy buena ya que los estimulos por productividad son muy buenos.
good,Had a great time working here and gave me a good learning experience
good,"I didn't particularly like the management system or the hoops but the people are great. There is not a lot of opportunity to use diverse talents because the roles are very strict and don't allow cross functional work. Writers write, pasters paste and never do the 2 meet in a single job."
good,Greeting customers
good,"I currently work a 8a-5p job, with an hour (+) in travel each way. I work with event coordinators and executives to create group travel. I also take phone calls and email to assist business travelers with domestic and international travel and visa/passport applications and requirements. I've become very self motivated in my work, I do not require micro managing, I'm timely, dependable and resourceful. I go the extra mile for my travelers to ensure that they have seamless trips. My current manager is not timely, or a micro manager, so pretty much anything goes as far as 2 hour lunches or 30 minutes late in the morning, or both. This works for my co-workers who take full advantage, however I prefer a more structured work environment, working with people of equal motivation. I enjoy goals and training and opportunity. I'm a dedicated, hard worker and willing to do what it takes to help a company meet their goals. The hardest part of my job is my commute. The best part of my current job are the clients, they are wonderful. As well as the facility that I work in, it's a brand new building with tons of amenities."

good,"Overall I enjoyed my 11 years in American Express. I enjoyed my co-workers and learned what it takes to be a good employee. There typical days, and not so typical days. The hardest things were the changes that had to be made along the way. I would go back to work there if I could."
good,I would have stayed forever if the company had not become a joint venture with Maritz Travel. The company culture had changed and ceased to be the company I signed up to work for.

good,"Going to work was a joy for me. Being in a leadership role truly gave me a sense of ""belong"" where I had the opportunity to make a difference in the lives of individuals by showing them their potential and helping them believe in themselves; elevating their confidence. Seeing the glass have full instead of half empty all the time. Putting our heads together..myself and my coworkers were a team. We tried to do things collaboratively and shared best practices for the betterment of the business. Understanding the company's vision from management and being able to carry this out to my team and break it down so they can understand the big picture is something that management always looks for. How effectively can you influence your people to get the best out of them. The hardest part of my job was keeping the momentum going without losing myself in the process. You'll never have the team 100%...but I belive in the 80/20 rule. Focus on those who are willing to work hard for you and who are driving results...and keep them motivated. Those who aren't...identify issues and put an action plan in place...if necessary performance manage. The most enjoyable part of my job was to see the growth and development of people whether it be mini break throughs or huge milestones...it's a gift that I give which is the giving of myself to others to see them succeed."

good,Good place to work while finishing college or university.  Good managers and colleagues. Would recommend to a friend as a job to gain knowledgeable experience.
good,The workplace is fun and relaxed. Some teams are involved in high performance projects whereas most teams are relatively relaxed. No perks or benefits apart from salary.
good,its a great company just some management need to remember that people are human. Life happens to everyone and mostly the company works with you and the benefits are amazing. If you hate staying indoors this isnt the job for you.
good,"Love this job, each day is never the same. My position possess a very high learning curve, thus making it challenging and not boring. Very relax atmosphere regarding their managerial approach."

good,"I spent almost 20 years with American Express, It is a good company to work for and advance. They let you pick your path and encourage you to do your best."
good,Reputable Company with great benefits and pay. Poor leadership/management is highly unqualified. No clear paths for growth/development. Constant changes in metrics moving the finish line in the middle of the race multiple times to avoid paying incentives. Some very unprofessional managers.
good,My only complaints is that they don’t supervise team leaders that much so there is a lot of injustice when it comes to weather you are friends with the team leaders or not
good,"I liked the job. But between management change and commuting 2 hours each way, I decided it was time for a change. I did enjoy the job and enjoyed helping customers."
good,I find the company very interesting in terms of all the currencies and the different foreigners that i work with. Also because i am a Client Liason Officer that drives out all over Cape Town to take our great service to the client i get to see and meet alot of new people.
good,"Es muy grande empresa, y siempre cambia algo."
good,"The hardest part about working for American Express is that they hire large quantities of employees at a time, then within a few years, they lay most of them off.  I was laid off after working for only 9 months.  I was hired in a different department, so I was able to stay with the company for an additional 11 years, then was laid off again."
good,Managing large teams looking after variety of Investment Banks in the City of London.  Balancing customer service and meeting call answering SLA's which are all shown in KPI's.

good,its a very nice job. loved the people. They made coming to work a great experience. The customers are very interesting every day. Never a dull moment at work.
good,"Great company and solid leadership at the highest levels within the organization.  The middle management is young and trying to get ahead at the expense of other people.  Great recognition programs, field employee's are often the most working the long hours as their roles are more people and process heavy."
good,"Solid, 140 year old company that cares deeply about it's reputation and its people.  However, it isn't for everyone.  IT life at AMEX is a cubicle existence within a sea of humanity and periodic uncontrolled distractions.  Most of the people are very professional and good.  Leadership and upward mobility are primarily for those who have been groomed for it - outsiders generally are not considered equally.  If you are an independent and assertive type, chances are you will rub someone the wrong way. Work-from-home is flexible for those who can get it, but they are also intent about ensuring there are 'butts-in-seats'."
good,"AMEX is a great company - if you're a part of the ""inner circle"".  Strong silo guards stand ready at the door to preclude intrusions from the outside.  Great working environment - IF you're one of the chosen."
good,No assigned work space - no privacy and very loud and distracting work environment.  Many great people work for this company.  Management changes often.
good,"As a computer programmer in each of these companies, I worked long hours but enjoyed my job. It was challenging and required some travel to clients. These jobs were many years ago before having children."
good,This was a Great place to work. Great for intermediate level engineers looking to grow and expand there experience. Difficult to receive a Full time employment however contract pay is higher then average.
good,"AmEx was a pleasure to work with, although it is a large bureaucracy to navigate. "
good,"Working here tought me alot about corporate/business travel."
good,A empresa me deu oportunidade de crescer assim que foi apresentado resultados com a minha desenvoltura rápida em aprender e entender a rotina da empresa.
good,"Its a good organisation. Management isn't that great. If that can be fixed,  everything else will fall into place. Oderwise its a good company where you can benifit urself to nurture the best in you."
good,It was nice working for american express and my team was supportive and helpful. Made some really nice friends that I have for life long even though I moved to another place.
good,"Great experience to have on a resume, given opportunities to learn. Size of the company makes it hard to be visible outside of your own work group. Compensation isn’t outstanding"
good,"It was challenging in nature, to provide maximum output with 0 tolerance for customer experience. FDCPA was given utmost priority which makes the environment professional. It was a fulfilled working experience"
good,American Express sends a lot of jobs overseas. I worked there for thirteen years and I recall seven layoffs before I was laid off. They had great customer service trainings. I had several team leaders the years I was there and I only has one bad one the rest were great.
good,"""Best Work life balance for employees"
good,"American Express is a good company overall to work provided that you have the right leadership."
good,"This is the seconf time I worked on contract at Amex, and both times, Amex went through a period where they terminated the majority of contracts over a short period.  However, I was able to work there for an 8 year period this time before termination."
good,"American Express was a great company to work for. they treat their employees wonderfully. "
good,"I was at AMEX for nearly two years and everything was great until being displaced.  You get absolutely no support from upper management  in attempting to find a new role within the company.  Most of the postings are done as a formality as the hiring manager already knows who they plan on choosing.  Unless you know someone personally or it's one of the random openings where they go by the book, be very careful. So make sure you get into Amex where the dept is extremely small and you cannot be replaced (but ultimately everyone is replaceable)"
good,"I had a lot of fun initially at american express. A lot to learn and a lot of advancements. "
good,Une organisation des forces de vente sur le terrain très structurée mais délaissant le côté humain du chargé de mission
good,"At AmEx you get an opportunity to make an income & grow internally.  While salaries are lower than other companies, work/life balance is a benefit. If you're a professional, good natured and attentive to priorities, you'll do well."
good,"I have been working at American Express full-time"
good,American express tiene un muy buen ambiente laboral
good,I really liked working for American Express as a Financial Advisor. My work involved helping families with financial planning such as retirement and educational.  Also helped young couples save for their first home and other savings goals.
good,"Well paid company. Reporting directly to a fair & supportive manager is key to having a satisfactory job life at Amex. Without that, it can be difficult. "
good,"Pros: Enough PTO, decent pay."
good,"Customer service skills is key and required, to deal with various customer needs and requests, ability to think on your toes, and make quick decisions. Requires PR and communication skills, confidence, administration skills.."
good,I used to love my job but with the loss of the Costco partnership and the budget cuts that followed I don't have the same passion for my job anymore. Overall still a good place to work but if you're a top performer you'll be rewarded better elsewhere.
good,the multiple clients and multiple clients made for an extremely demanding position with American express GBT.. They have a 6 month busy season which demands a large amount of overtime and demands a high call volume from the agents
good,"*Entregar la venta al inicio y al final del dia,"
good,"I have learnt a lot being into this organization, with the best shift timing from 7:30 till 16:00. I have learnt to be a team player and how to display yourself different from all other team members in the team of 14 people. The workplace culture is good, everybody is focused as we have to maintain our scorecard and disputes is the critical and most important department for the American Express. The hardest part would be the salary which we get is not up to the expectations and the work we do. Also, there is no job security in the organization."
good,"Out bound calling, typical call center work. Nice little salary with commission. Very few making good money. Most just get by. Cubical work while being able to manage your own clients. It was very backwards at times. They would ask why you didn't make 100 calls in a day where you spent 6 hours in various meetings. Normal corporate world."
good,"American Express in the AET (Technologies) department is an ever-changing environment. The company has many different areas to explore, learn, and grow."
good,"Overall, American Express is a great place to work. There are so many areas of business that you can gain experience in. The benefits are amazing. However, the culture and management can be a struggle to integrate into/work with."
good,"it was good and used to do the same work also over there "
good,"es una empresa con un ambiete de trabajo tranquilo, te pagan todos tus beneficios, los horarios son rotativos y no apoyan a los estudiantes"
good,American Express is a great company. The American Express brand is top notch and people recognize American Express as a reputable business to trust and partner with. The people are fantastic and the culture is productive people will be successful and recognized.
good,Working with American Express was quite the experience. I had started as a NOC technician with them and it was a lot of fun learning the systems there and the people were amazing.
good,"Fixing up appointments with the clients & meeting them in person for pitching of new credit card schemes & enrolling them as a membership. "
good,"Amex is highly motivated on excellence and being the most respected service provider brand in the marketplace "
good,"Was very nice to work for American Express, Unfortunately they closed our office location, Fellow employees were always pleasant and helpful to work with,"
good,Good place with lots of technology to work on except everyone is driven by the bonuses just like any other big organization.
good,I've worked at American Express Technologies for 10 years. The work environment is very good. The schedule is very flexible and my team allowed everyone to work from home. Pay is not the best but the flexibility makes up for it. Management comes and goes and there are good ones and bad ones.
good,"Great Company to work for. Lots of potential growth opportunities. Cares about their employees, recognizes ones achievement, and promotes within first."
good,You need to work hard for the goals and money is on the table. Mostly night shift only is an option. You learn the banking regulations and verification process in detail. Bright co-workers and experienced leaders. Management is typically slow paced in all departments.
good,The company continues to grow and update processes.  They are currently reorganizing  some processes and staffing.  The company is always customer focused and encourages front line employees to always work to provide the best customer service experience possible.
good,"As a collection specialist you can make great money but it's extremely stressful. Along with this, there is very little help from your immediate supervisor regarding training or feedback. If there is a complaint, AMEX doesn't protect their collectors at all. They expect perfection on every call and if a customer gets upset you are left twisting in the wind by the company. The benefits are great and so is the money."
good,"American Express har varit en väldigt bra skola att gå för att lära sig om betallösningar och om finans sektorn generellt."
good,"These days any job are not secure, however working for large corporate you feel more that one day my day to be redundant."
good,"13 plus years of experience in leading product and capability development from ideation to launch which includes defining product strategies, managing product development  with internal and external partners and bringing to market integrated  end  to end business insight solutions. Experienced as a product owner within a scrum environment."
good,"What I like about this company is the generous time off they give, tuition reimbursement, and many other little offers such as 50% off health programs such as Weight Watchers as an example."
good,"American Express has been very good to me and has treated me very well through all 16 of my years there. I have been given several opportunities for advancement and have been promoted several times. "
good,Loved the people with whom I worked. Enjoyed the work culture and the atmosphere. VP's were easy to speak with and had an open door policy that allowed you to discuss issues.
good,"Great company, many opportunities in the finance industry. Started on the phones for a few years and worked my way into different roles. Some areas are easier for advancement while others are a dead end. Overall good perks, can be better, but good, not great."
good,American Express is a true marketing company and there are so many strong pleople to learn from.  It's a tough environment but it will make you strong and give you great skills.   They reorganize a lot so job security is not the best but having this company on your resume will open doors.
good,"Typical Day:  My day was spent moving from one project meeting to another while still managing to perform all other project needs (Project documentation, managing as many as 3 BAs and 6 ITT resources. "
good,"American Express allowed a work from home environment, which was beneficial. Micro management seemed to be extremely excessive."
good,Good place to work to people. Employees friendly organization. This is located in gurgaon and a good for long term for the people to work. Provide good opportunity to people.
good,I worked for AMEX from Syntel. I cannot comment anything about AMEX management or work culture. Up to my knowledge if we become direct employee of AMEX then your job security will be good. And visibility and recognition will be good.
good,"Great work-life balance. "
good,Nice place to work. However your growth and development is not a main concern even though it is promoted highly when you are interviewed for the position.
good,The typical factory Employee Are quite friendly. They made the learning experience easy for me. It can be a overload of work sometimes. But hey so can any other job.
good,"Led the transformation of the American Express digital marketing roadmap, including most recently the expansion of strategic partnerships with publishers and agencies. There are many subcultures at American Express, so finding the right fit in the right team is important for career advancement. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with super intelligent people and launching new products for consumers and merchants alike."
good,Era constante me dedicaba a mi trabajo pero el ambiente siempre fue muy pesado se sentía mala vibra o envidias dentro de la misma
good,"Typical day - each day is different, based on business needs, changing volumes & meeting Compliance deadlines"
good,"Os consultores, vão a ruas em busca de novos clientes , as respostas negativas ao longo tempo , passam a ter réplicas mais rápidas e  , traduzidas em números, Para vender cinco, tem que visitar 15 , só vende quem oferece.O conhecimento do produto ou serviço e do mercado ( concorrente ) é de vital importância para concluir uma negociação Fui agraciado com uma promoção pelo Gerente Regional , sem comentários."
good,It was a nice environmet that always had opportunity to grow and show case yourself as a BSA
good,"J'ai beaucoup aimé travailler cher eu ,c'était une très belle expérience.le seul soucie c'est qu'il n'y a pas de fixe et que méme si l'on fait beaucoup de contrat,il ne sont pas tous accepté."
good,"Great place to start your career and/or learn. Ample opportunity to move around the  company (issuer, merchant services, Bank, Corporate or Finance) or change function (marketing, client management, business planning)."
good,Un grand groupe qui cherche à s'adapter à un marché du voyage professionnel sans cesse en évolution.
good,"American Express is a wonderful company, it's well run, the leaders act with integrity and there's an overall nod to work life balance. I work with smart and wonderful people and I've learned so much in the seven years I've been with the company. "
good,"un día típico era llegar alas 2 de la tarde asegurar tu zona de trabajo para ver si hacia alguna irregularidad (encontrar sucio, falta de material etc.) revisar mi sistema de computo verificando que todo trabajara tal y como lo deje el día anterior. entrar al sistemas para iniciar mis labores diarias. revisar a compañeros para que no tuviesen ningún problema y en todo caso asistirlo de cualquier modo, la directiva era muy relajada no había mucha presión los demás en la zona no eran renegados todos nos ayudamos en lo que se necesitara, lo mas difícil del trabajo era que los clientes pudiesen demostrar sus ingresos para poder otorgarles los beneficios de la empresa. y por terminar lo que mas me gusto fue lo que aprendí lo cual es el sistema mundial de tarjetas de crédito como usarla como beneficiarte de ellas sus pro y sus contras etc."
good,Decent company to work for... dedicated automotive supplier run and home every night
good,"In this company I was working on several projects. Starting with telephone costumer care, where I was pointed out as the most professional in the team, they chose to let me work in direct contact with costumers. As I have an outgoing personality, it was easy for me to get the sympathy of potential costumers and convince them in the quality of our products. "
good,The typical day involved a quick-passed environment with a strong desire to create a market-positive view of the brand.  They generally accomplish this by taking good care of their card holders and give employees opportunities to move upward.  Internally (for employees and contractors alike) there are stringent demands to achieve top performance.  The hardest part of the job was getting management to pay more than lip service to work/life balance.  I enjoyed the companionship of co-workers and the opportunity to learn new things.
good,"Very stressful"
good,loved working there when I did. great place to work and lovely people.
good,"Although it is one of the best working places, but growth opportunities is slow."
good,"Dia típico de trabalho: Trabalhar na área de atendimento."
good,"The best part of the company is the people who work there. Bright, motivated, supportive and fun. I have also appreciated how movement across functions and departments is encouraged.  As a result, I have been exposed to a wide range of functions."
good,"Good company to work for. Not a great salary."
good,Being a part of AMEX its a wonderful thing . Working under such organization sharpen your skills that what the best thing is.Your talent is been noted here.I feel proud to be the part of AMEX but i am looking forward to next best opportunity.
good,"Buen horario laboral de lunes a viernes."
good,"Fast paced, dynamic, challenging work place with great leaning opportunities.  Surrounded by great and smart people with a passion for learning and growth.  Compliance driven analytics where my team has built a full process, from data generation to analysis and reporting.  Process includes surveying customer contact data, capturing any errors based on actual regulations, compiling data and driving analytics, used to address identified problems. "
good,"lot of things to learn over there"
good,"I started in EPOS as part of the Outbound team calling Merchants to set up their terminals with Amex, I then progressed to the Inbound team taking calls from Merchants regarding technical issues and requesting terminal set ups. I currently work in the Card Clearance part of the EPOS team, dealing with sending all new requests that come through to us to the banks for clearance. I deal on a daily basis with Merchants our Amex proprietary signing Channels and our Partner Banks and third party providers, resolving any queries that might arise from the clearance requests. I am also responsible for the weekly and monthly reports that the Card Clearance team produce which monitors terminal initialization for the UK market.."
good,"Lot of good work and cutting edge technology is being implemented. The work content is exciting, and engaging, with opportunity to learn new skills due to frequent re-orgs. Most co-workers and reports are nice to work with. However, the culture is highly political, closed and cut-throat due to relatively higher level of compensation and lack of other opportunities within Arizona, with clear advantage for those who have been in the company for 7-10 years coming up the ranks with existing relationships. Most positions are posted, and filled internally."
good,I love my cardmembers and painting the picture of a perfect vacation.
good,"Generous rewards, salary average to above, stock options for certain job grades. Lots of on call."
good,Learned many techniques about customer inquires and problem solving. Company's culture and benefits were the great. Management  was not very strong in terms of taking immediate decisions.
good,it was really good working with it. working hours were quiet flexible.
good,"I developed and implemented the ""Be Real"" Program. The program is several workshops and modules that empower employees at work."
good,"Good exposure to client"
good,"Amex is a great company overall. They are built with clear division between departments which can be a benefit as well as a hindrance."
good,I enjoyed my work at American Express as I loved working closely with my clients on a day to day basis. My favorite thing about American Express? The appreciation and satisfaction I felt after helping a client in need. My least favorite? Having a supervisor who admitted to other colleagues that she found me intimidating and wanted to make my work life horrible for me - and not get reprimanded for it. 
good,Relaxed enviriomnet. Working in a blue works enviroment allows collaboration and networking wiht others. Flexible in working from home and having a worklife balanced schedule. Culture is great but always depends on the SVP and some create an environment of employee cliques leaving some out.
good,It is truly a great place to work but you have to be cognizant of who your management is...they do not do a good job of training you extensively.
good,Servicing a blue chip company
good,"Provided great exposure to many businesses within one Company - Finance, Call Center, Customer Experience, Merchant Services and Travel."
good,You get the oppurtunity to become fully licensed in Property/Casualty license and Accident/health. You are given job security for at least a year.
good,Ofcourse its all about politics and ofcourse theres is a lot of favortisim but the pay is good and the work enviroment isnt too bad
good,Band 30 jobs are not good you will then be a salary paid employee working 50-60 hr weeks and no overtime or raise.
good,"Typical day: Effectively analyzed, extended and denied credit accounts. 100% phone job."
good,"Routine job with on par management, great benefits and compensation."
good,"Communicated with clients to determine destination, experience in domestic or international locations,"
good,"A wonderful place to work with many advantages and an emphasis on work/life balance. The company continually wanting to improve and apply process improvements and education for employees. The worst part was during the process improvements, many positions are continually in jeopardy."
good,"Excellent people, competitive environment. Heavily matrixed organization."
good,"American Express is a global concern so it does protect the business very carefully, and this includes balancing shareholder, cardmembers, and employee constituencies. Generally, it is a generous company, and a great place to work."
good,This is a self directed company that provides endless tools designed to help people succeed.
good,"Due to AMEX's staggering abuse of the H1B system, and many employees being contractors, job security is dodgy at best. The work environment is relaxed though, and I always felt comfortable to tackle work without many interruptions."
good,Lot of work pressure and managers are supportive but daily meeting is not acceptable but some managers always take morning and evening meeting and pressurize the sales employees and late working hours unnecessary.
good,I was looking after the PA and BTA accounts for the German and Austria Market. I really enjoyed the position as we were a very multicultural team with people from all walks of life.
good,"A typical workday all depends on the role. BAU roles have fixed hours and  others have longer hours. "
good,"American Express is, of course, a global company with a lot of offices (and many remote workers), so the culture of the org can be very different from one office or department to another. On the whole, it is a high-performing culture that is more competitive than collegial. "
good,"I worked at the company for 6 years until my job was downsized post 9/11 along with 40% of the IT staff. I started as an IT consultant in Risk Management and converted to a full time developer/manager. My first 4 years and supervisor were amazing: interesting work, hard-work, but balanced and fair compensation, but my supervisor was let go when new management came along and brought their own people. "
good,Great benefits and pay some of the best in the industry. The job is sales focused and it is something that they ellude to but is heavily enforced. If you are a commission motivated sales person than this is a great job for you. If you are customer focused
good,"Enjoyed working there. Everyone was respectful of each other and always willing to help with issues to get resolved as soon as possible. No micro management, allowed you to do your job and make your own decisions of what you thought best, but always someone willing to assist if needed"
good,Smart and fun people. Diversified business model. Nice offices. Good location. American Express makes money in several different ways so the company will remain recession proof.
good,"It was a pleasure working with the company. Most of my career, I was part of the wonderful organization. If I get a chance in future, would love to work."
good,"The management was not good, but the employees were excellent. The upper management has issues with people that are smarter than them. Therefore to get things done took longer than necessary due to the lack of technical skills of the management."
good,".•	Ensured that OAT and UAT are formulated, planned and executed in structured ways within working scheduled delivery dates. Administered and accurately controlled the defect in Jira."
good,Culture changed in recent years. The company had become cold and impersonal even at a time they believed they were being more inclusive  it was not the company I joined nor was it one I desired to remain a part of
good,"American Express does a nice job keeping remote employees engaged.  They offer great benefits and generous time off package.  "
good,American Express was a good place to work. In 2017 American Express decided to move my job to India otherwise I would still be there. Looking forward to the next chapter in IT PM work.
good,"Most of the time I was left alone to do my job, which I enjoyed. At times when dealing with multiple business group it’s could become political. Overall enjoyed the challenge"
good,"Good company"
good,Most people know that AmEx is a financial company but it is also a software company.  It is a competitive environment because its rating process compares people in the same band.  It is trying to transition to more of an enterprise culture but ultimately employees are rated against each other so it has not been able to make that transition.  The people at AmEx are bright and capable.  It outsources a great deal of its technology talent.
good,"Things are constantly changing, so be able to adapt to change. The management isn't the most helpful. They are extremely strict on basically everything and they will write you up for things that happened several months ago. Metrics are stressful and hard to balance."
good,"Its great learning experience at AmEx. especially APM tools."
good,Excellent benefits and chance for promotions.  Good work environment and opportunity to learn.  Diversified environment.  Open work concept is noisy though.
good,"Buena empresa para trabajar, te da buenas prestaciones, lo que muchas no tienen. Buen ambiente de trabajo, mucha presión dentro del área de ventas."
good,"Het is een zeer zelfstandige job zeker op HBO niveau. Een stukje economie is wel handig als achtergrond en of bancaire sector. Het gaat om het behalen van targets. Je gaat door totdat deze behaald zijn, dus geen 9-5 job. Collega's steunen je via pep talk telefonisch en op de salesmeeting elke week. Soms heb je regio's die gedaan moeten worden. Prima job voor een echte hunter met pit. Salaris mag hoger......"
good,Full time employee position at AMEX never felt secure.  Contractor positions overrode permanent  full time positions. Contractors positions were promoted more then full time positions
good,"nice colleagues to work with, this was the reason i stayed so long , good name but poor company, things were not secure , every year was getting worse."
good,"Overall great company with great benefits. The opportunity for advancement is within your reach. Reimbursement for furthering your education, as long at is within the business needs."
good,Overall good company to work for and great room for growth. Your experience is very much based on your leader and that can sometimes affect the working environment. The company makes decisions slowly so it is not the place for someone who enjoys rapid movement.
good,"Always learning new processes and nuances.  Loved the people you are working with and the management takes a genuine concern for your career path. "
good,The surveys sent to customers have to much weight with no consideration for job performance or prior rankings.  Any ratings by customers under 9 is a zero and carryovers for 3 months.
good,"Es una empresa que fomenta un buen ambiente laboral"
good,Its good company to work. Good work-life balance. The management should be more prompt in taking quick decisions for employee career development for better future alignments.
good,"Working with this company helps me in a way like free benefits, free parking and free food also. Its a big save for me. when it comes to my colleagues some of them will give you hard time especially if  your new and they think you are a threat to them, but eventually you will get along with them."
good,"Best part: great people, great perks and benefits, opportunities to learn and grow"
good,"I think that AMEX is a really good place to work, especially if you come from a coding bootcamp. Technology wise, they are definitely moving in the right direction, but  it is still a financial services company so that culture is still apparent."
good,American Express is a great company to work for.  I really enjoyed working for my teamleader for over 8 years.  I enjoyed the constant learning of new systems and procedures.
good,"Fast paced environment, I worked on many dedicated accounts that I enjoyed. Company became more worried about scripted phone calls and call time, versus customer service."
good,"Conoscere persone, conoscre indirizzi differenti..."
good,"Good company but only stayed for a short while on training."
good,"Benefits are very good.  Your happiness largely depends on which area you wind up in and who you work for.  They used to be better about working remotely, but like many companies they're drinking the kool-aid that working from home is a bad thing."
good,"Grande azienda, splendido marchio, chi ha opinioni negative sulla carta di credito non l'ha mai avuta o non può averla"
good,Very process oriented and great place to learn how projects should be executed. Managers are cooperative. Good family and work balance. Would love to go back
good,Amex was fun while I was there. The people were always supportive and the training was amazing. I did however get let go while on mat leave due to a restructure and I did not find that fair. Over 100 people were let go and most of them were on leave.
good,"great company structure and values - would of liked more development opportunities, and constant management changes and restructuring probably had an impact on this - can get a little monotonous."
good,"a great company to work for, has many benefits and offers very good career advancement opportunities for all.  there is a push for work life balance and this company responded well by offering options to its employees."
good,The company is really a workaholic place nut you will learn on how to survive with it in a very short period of hime. I learnt how to tackle different types of customers. The management is well organised. The workplace is well groomed but the discipline can be improved. The hard part about the job is high expectations from the management. The enjoyable part is everyday we will have meeting about the review and waste half a day on it.
good,"Working at American Express provides a good work-life balance and the company is particularly focused on providing good parental leave benefits. However, most of the benefits are family oriented and maybe not as attractive for millenials that might not get equivalent benefits that matter to them. "
good,Nice building immenities. Great cafeteria. Get there early for a decent parking spot. Great family events. Management shows favoritism. Your entire team will be punished if one person messes up.
good,A typical day at work can be extremely busy.   I've had an opportunity to increase my skill sets and collaborated  with various business units and professionals.  Management varied due to the number of employees in the division I supported.  The workplace culture is pleasant.  What I enjoy the most is the culture and the collaboration amongst colleagues.
good,"this is a great first job, although the 0 hours aspect meant i didnt get a steady amount of work, with shifts being taken very quickly. i also worked on matchdays, which meant when the game was on, there was an hour and a half of unpaid work, waiting to go back for another hour or so. aside from this, the management was good and i gained a lot of experience."
good,"Manager would do things and blame me for them.  Screamed a lot.  Very stressful job.  I had to learn the financial documents as I went.  She would give me about 3 days work every morning at our meeting.  I was never caught up.  Schedule clients, confirm appointments, re-schedule clients and then scream because I was calling the clients too much.  I had to start writing down everything I did when I did it because she always wanted to know what I did."
good,"Log into the phone and take as many client bookings as you can. Balance time on the phone and documentation off the phone. Hardest part of job was when dealing with bookings that had some kind of error and flights, hotel or the car rental was canceled."
good,"Great people, loyal dedicated and fun.  Too many reorganizations leaving employees displaced.  I think the company would be more effective keeping seasoned employees as opposed to displacing them."
good,I was happy there. Used all my skills. There was no typical day. Learned to  be more patient.  Hardest part of the job was the constant changes but I did enjoy that no two day were alike.
good,"American Express is a good company to work with and a supportive work environment.  There is a positive social atmosphere that encourages building strong working relationships with colleagues.  Opportunities for advancement exist within the context of cliques and relationship histories.  Depending on assigned manager, direct professional support can be limited."
good,The American Express experience was very good. I had a great manager & my time in the field was very enlightening. I gained confidence & exposure to new businesses on a variety of levels.
good,good work at home opportunity. management of teams is a bit confusing. The structure of training and onboarding left me a little lost and confued. It was little frustrating also
good,Call center great place to learn call center experience.Learned communication skills. Great management strategy very firm on strategy. Very good friendly staff. Too many calls.
good,"great company to work for i would go back if given te opportunity meet lots of interesting peoplelove the pay great benefits, large cafeteria, also daycare available on site amex also offers immediate benefits from the 1st day employed"
good,"Très bonne ambiance dans toutes les équipes quelles soient au nombre de 6 ou de 50 mais ""open space"" insupportable et hiérarchie très rigide + rétention de l'information"
good,"Definitely need more fair compensation. Relied solely on incentive. Cannot afford to live in the area where office located. Management cares, they were like a family. Pay was not so great. Health benefit with large deductible, however good 401k match. Large part of checks allocated to healthcare."
good,Excelente empresa para se trabalhar.  Ótimo crescimento profissional e pessoal.
good,"Organization has changed dramatically as a place to work in the last 5 years.  Historically a collaborative employee focused organization even during times of reengineering.  In recent years much top talent has been cut likely due to market pressures, disruptors and significant loss of business ( Costco, Airlines Parnters )  Hence AMEX value prop has changed"
good,career advancement is based on friendships not talent. Could be the best company at the same time can be the worst depending on middle managers. Sunrise center is state of the art.
good,"American express is a wonderful company, the only issue can be the environment if call centers aren't for you.it's a fast paced and stressful world, I miss it and would be happy to go back if i could."
good,Entreprise qui prend soin de ses employés et qui les intègrent très rapidement.
good,"While being in a financial account in customer-service oriented setting may be bothersome for others, the company makes it worth the while for their employees through rigorous employee engagement activities, rewarding performance through very high incentives dependent on the employee's customer sat scores, and other additional benefits i.e. transportation allowance, etc."
good,Global matrix company with significant focus on marketing in financial services industry. Being part of certain divisions better than others. Culture good.
good,"When I started with AMEX, under Harvey Golub as CEO, it was an amazing place to work.  When Ken Chenault took over, the culture slowly changed, and it was no longer fun. HR became more of the ""good ol boys"" club; Ken got rid of the employee survey; and the environment turned competive instead of collaborative. It was very disappointing."
good,Amex is a great place to work if you find the right leader and support but upward mobility is limited. Benefits and PTO are really amazing - especially 20 weeks paid parental leave.
good,"Over a decade spent working here, the longest I have worked anywhere, which must say something. Demanded their pound of flesh but overall well rewarded."
good,"The culture was amazing and I worked with some great people at Amex. It was unfortunate that I was not able to select certain level of leadership going in, or I believe I would still be with the organization."
good,"great company to work for, very diverse. too bad job insecurity is so high. i was there 10+ years and was finally impacted by ""reduction in force"" aka - moving operations overseas."
good,"enjoyed team of professionals that I worked with but resigned due "
good,"i can choose part time job in working still know "
good,"Working as an automation lead with Amex, I got exposure to the newest technologies in the market. Agile work culture with friendly atmosphere among the team."
good,The company was well run and very competitive.  Opportunities in Salt Lake City are very limited. Great training and travel opportunities to build your expertise and help others to be the best that they can be.
good,Employee survey taken seriously and will be actioned upon. A lot of processes to follow  which sometimes may hinder the speed in delivering a project.
good,Great company with poor management in my Department. Amex has great benefits and a fun work atmosphere.  They're very big on work/life balance and regularly allow employees to work from home.
good,Culture has changed from pleasant to worrisome with downsizing.  I would not recommend a finance position at the company unless the person was located in India.
good,"The company is great, but depending on the department, the schedules aren't that flexible. It's a call center. The training however is very hands on. They want to ensure you are well prepared."
good,"Productive and fund work place with ping pong table, TVs, games, flexible working schedules. "
good,"Company is cutting it's workforce down by the hundreds.. From full time employees to contractors, they're laying off people in the 100's.  You are nothing but a number to these guys.. Old timers will do their best to keep you away from them..  the culture at times can suck."
good,A great company with lots of benefits. They start at day one.  Management is very supportive of advancement. Acknowledges when a job well done.  Think outside of the box.
good,They have a great background and great positions. But training is over done and over babied to the point where you get too much information and you go in overload
good,Several departments and working fields allowing plenty of opportunity for development. development is encouraged by management and support for development is provided
good,"Good Please tell us more about working at this company in Your Review."
good,"Spent many years in different departments; had a great time, at home and overseas; alas, like many companies, things change and not for the better."
good,"Learned a lot about B2B through the training program. People are"
good,"Expect to wrk hard and spend 2-3 years per role.  Advancement typically requires relocation."
good,I made lots of money by just doing my job.  You can really do well if you do your work.  It is suprising how many people came to work and only made half the money I did from their laziness.
good,"Nice management and supporting team members."
good,Good team environment to work in. They also have sales targets and incentives that pushes a healthy competitive workplace between agents. New accounts specialist approve application as per credit bureau status. Fast paced and a GREAT place to work.
good,Time was spent cutting through red tape at times to get job related functions completed.  Well executed projects at time paid off and were recognized.
good,since the banks have become part of the bank holding company the are just like the mother company. they used to have separate Utah culture but have now adopted the NY culture and the bottom line is the most important thing. employee perks have given way to stock holders and layoffs are more common.
good,"very corporate centered, bottom line is the most important. they use a contractor model that keeps jobs off shore and doesn't allow for internal growth. it is difficult to grow unless you come from the outside into an executive position then they don't stay very long. Years ago the employee was the most important asset. now it is the stock holders. the bottom line must look good which sometimes means letting people go to show less out put and more earinings."
good,I haven't worked at American Express in the past 10 years.  During my tenure it was a great place to learn the payments business.  American Express is very focus and developing the next leaders
good,"I enjoyed my time working for this company. My team was full of good people and the working  environment was great.Frequent"
good,Its manageable. The work life balance is fine. The work is fine. Company is an okayish pay master. The management is fine and is technical . The quality of work is fine.
good,"Make poor decisions based on the stock and annual earnings, not what is best for the company long term and/or the employees. Need to realize good talent and keep them."
good,"An sich kein schlechter Job, jedoch wurde die Abteilung massiv reduziert und die Arbeit extern verlagert, so dass es nur eine Frage der Zeit war, wann ich auich gehen soll. Also habe ich leider schon nach kurzer Zeit adieu gesagt."
good,"I loved working here, there was a really strong team bond where you felt like everyone was family in a way. I made friends here who will be my friends for life, there was always such an up beat positive vibe around the office. It was awesome that everyone always worked so well and bounced ideas off each other. The senior management team really genuinely cared about the morale of the team which was amazing."
good,This company was spun off and is now called Ameriprise. The same culture and values have carried over to the new company. I have many friends who still work there.
good,It is a great place to work. I have never been more happy with a co. like Amex and would never have quit but the Travel division was outsourced to Exl in 2009.
good,Une organisation anglo-saxonne avec une grande qualité client
good,"Great benefits, salary and work life balance. Must be adaptable to constant change and broad spectrum of leadership styles. "
good,"* a lot of good people "
good,"Capacitación continua, excelente ambiente de trabajo "
good,American Express is a great company with a solid future. I've enjoyed my time here and the growth opportunities that they've provided. They understand the importance of personal and professional growth as well as the importance of work life balance.
good,an ideal company to work with. well pay master and takes care of employees' satisfaction. fun loving atmosphere. good incentives and bonuses. very good company overall
good,Amex is a very good place to start your career. Leaders are very supportive when you start and you learn a lot. Work is very interesting because the entire payment ecosystem is undergoing change so new challenges keeps appearing to always keep you on your toes. Overall very nice place.
good,"Variety of responsibilities - at all levels."
good,"Good Environment, learning culture, cooperative teams."
good,"My time at the Amex Centurion Lounge was great. The food was delicious and fun to make with fellow cooks. Customers would always compliment and give us a pat on the back. I really enjoyed the enjoyment and satisfaction of customers. The job had its hard parts, like the long hours due to salary, It was also quiet the travel for me as well. But i did enjoy my time and experience at the job, I learned a lot from my fellow cooks and managers."
good,American Express is a great place to work.  They have a lot of benefits including Yoga during lunch and bicycles for exercising.  Also they will subsidize a Van Pool from  your area.
good,"American Express is a great company to work for, I really enjoyed my experience there, the company stands for a lot of diversity and I really appreciate it."
good,"Excellent salary and benefits. Almost 24/7 work schedule in my group, not all. Very demanding schedule. Job culture depends on the director and immediate VP."
good,Need to be motivated and network to get somewhere as there are so many competitive employees. Networking is key in that big corporate.
good,"good work life balance. "
good,"This is a great company to work for, where you can learn a lot of new  skills with a good work-life balance. "
good,"It's a high paced work environment. Numerous training to maintain their history of excellent customer service. Co-workers are wonderful, because we all try to help eachother succeed. The management does not do much until you do something wrong."
good,I worked in a center 9 years before transfering to Home Based Servicing. Working from.home sounds great... but its very lonely. Once you are at home their is very little opportunity for advancement and you are just stuck taking calls day after day with no end. It wears you down fast. I did enjoy that ability to drop and pick up hours easily with colleges. This made it simple to adjust my schedule with out using PD time. American Express is a great company but home based servicing was just not for me.
good,Fue una buena experiencia laboral con la cual rescato las  buenas personas con la q compartimos todo este tiempo de trabajo
good,"Good place to work , need to work on their remote location offices."
good,"Eine typische, amerikanische Firma, mit amerikanischer Leitkultur."
good,"good place to start career, good culture but less learning. "
good,"Lugar propicio para crecer profecionalmente ,se proporcionan cursos de capacitación según áreas laborales , buen trato de parte de la gerencia y administración ,"
good,"Excellent people to work with. The ability to socialize and collaborate team members on tasks and have fun, even during lunch."
good,"Amazing culture and a family environment. However, highly political at times which is expected of a global giant like American Express. Flexible working & freedom to try new things."
good,Its a dream company for any employee and have variety of process to work for. There are few processes having unskilled and biased management and thus leading to high attrition in that particular process and leaves no option for the employees joining that process except to change the company though they dont want to do so.
good,"Extremely professional environment but need to give its employees some some time to relax.,,,"
good,"Well diverse, exciting place with wonderful people. american Express is a company were you can grow and share your talents. You are given the experience and knowledge to grow within the company as well as with other company's. American Express provides great work "
good,"American Express can and has been an enjoyable place to work, they care and hold people with high regard. There is an entrepreneurial spirit amongst collaborative teams which can lead to standout performances by one or two people in an organization of 10's of thousands which is impressive."
good,Great people with interesting work but opportunities to grow within the organization are limited.  This is especially true if you are located outside of NYC.
good,"A typical day at work looked like 250-500 calls (depending on the season) a day. Being apart of American Express gave me the opportunity to speak with business customers from all over the world. I acquired a great deal of knowledge on how credit card work domestically and internationally, I understood the importance in customer privacy as well as deep understanding in customer reward structures (point systems). At this company I was given the opportunity to coach and train new employees on ""phone etiquette"" as well ensure new employees did not break bank regulatory law. The most difficult part of this job was maintaining a consistent attitude from your first call to your last!"
good,It was fun working with American express. The motivation set by co-workers is really good and makes you wanna get all the incentives every month. I learned that money comes after a lot of hard work. the management was not so good but somehow the motivation given by other co-workers used to wash away that effect.
good,"conditions de travail très agreable, autonomie forte et grosses perspectives d'evloution pour les top performers."
good,"Un día típico imposible diferenciar los días, ya que fueron todos monótonos."
good,"The best part about Amex is how flexible they have been with my work schedule.  I have had family medical issues over the last few years and they have been extremely accommodating.  This has been the best part about working for them. "
good,My experience is good so far but  the kind of the job has become quiet monotonous wherein I am quenching for some new learning
good,"Valoración buena."
good,"I enjoyed working for Amex, but the corporate structure was too much!  They really micro-managed everything. They recorded all of the ohine calls, told us what color to wear each day, etc."
good,Worked for some critical projects under Amex as a Middle ware Admin and Websphere Administrator . They use all the leading technologies
good,"okay company,great location the pay is not so good. I would have love to move up in the company but there was no place for growth."
good,I really liked this job and company. I would come in and get on the phone. I would talk to American Express card holders about there new card. You would have 2 15 minutes breaks and a 30 minute lunch. I was able to talk to my co-workers between calls. There are times that calls would come in fast or that customers did not want to talk to me but overall I liked the job. There was a lot of training and updates. We always understand what our job was and how to do it.
good,"It was a high stressed job. We did collections from past due accounts. Many times we would get yelled at, hung up on. The best part about the job was being able to negotiate with card members to try to bring accounts current."
good,Employees take pride in what they do.  Teamwork and Collaboration is excellent when senior leaders are aligned and there is a clear roadmap that has cascaded vertically and horizontally.
good,"American Express focused on diversity, equal opportunity and the highest level of customer care. I worked as a liaison between Customer Care and Operations of 19+ business units - ensuring online content was accurate, in compliance and up to design standards. I primarily worked remotely, but had a shared desk in the office that I could reserve when needed. I worked with an amazing team of professionals with many diverse backgrounds, which was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"American Express offers an amazing experience for those early in their career.   The work is rewarding and the people are wonderful making it a pleasure to go to work every day.   There is a strong competive spirit yet, you will find great support and knowledge that will help you in your career.  You will need to know how to build and leverage relationships effectively to succeed in any role in the company."
good,"work/life balance is great."
good,"I support three different managers currently working on strategic marketing plans, content, global communications, and reporting for certain card products. I am part of the PRIDE committee which I am organizing cross functional networking events with other ERG groups, such as the Black Employee Networks and the Hispanic group."
good,"Hired as an Executive Trainee, when the American Express (AMEX) bank was sold to Standard Chartered, in place of separating audit manager, I performed the concurrent audit of the most voluminous AMEX branch in India.  At 21, from experienced people shouting for the audit comments raised, I gained their respect within three months of the joining and settling down at the bank raising some diverse issues requiring immediate attention of the India operations director.  This job helped me discover my managerial skills - how to get things done from people while meeting reporting timelines."
good,Manage by check box.  Vision is clouded by personal gain and failure to advance overall profitability of organization.
good,Cognizant was a vendor for Customer Relationship Statementing team of American Express. The work and management culture of american express is great. The technical leads are approachable and helpful throughout the project execution. Recognition and appreciation of employees was done on a timely manner.
good,Company just transitioned most of their agents to work from home full time. They no longer have a walk-in office for Travel Planning. This has not been a great environment for most of the employees but works well for some.
good,"My passion is working with people and this allowed you to work with people to make a business trip arrangement from the car picking them up at home, express checkin at the airport, accommodation, meetings and anything to make the ease of conducting business overseas.  This went to the other end of luxurious travel to all reaches of the world.  Every day was unique and challenging.  "
good,"I worked in the prepaid resolutions department where we handled prepaid gift cards. I would be assigned to take calls about new inquires to set up investigations from either a merchant or a consumer and to provide case numbers. I would also be assigned to resolve the cases by determining if the cards were properly funded or to notify the client to send in additional paperwork by fax. I enjoyed the people on my team, they were very supportive and had a great work system to keep you busy and learning new processes. The management was great, our supervisor rotated each person on different assignments so we shared an equal work load. I also enjoyed the break room, they had the best coffee machine."
good,I enjoyed achieving and surpassing sales goals.  Management was appreciative of the results.
good,"work culture is awesome and work is also good."
good,"Company is a very good place to work for. "
good,"After working there for many years, I decided it was time for a change. However, overall I enjoyed my time there. The pay was pretty good, but ultimately the lack of advancement opportunities forced me to move jobs. The management always treated me with respect. The culture was typical for a big company like American Express. "
good,"Implemented successful marketing strategies to provide our clients with the companies premier products."
good,American Express is best company to work in. Lots of challenging tasks and roles have been given.
good,"always exiting working at Amex, no cafeteria but we were right across HBO's cafeteria which is the best."
good,"my job provided a great deal of variety to work independently as well as with others, locally and abroad."
good,My group manager never said no to any request and never added any resources. Learned a few things working with other department and made good friends.
good,The corporate travel industry was completely undermined by the 9/11 tragedy. We lost over 100 workers down to a skeleton crew. I worked until layoff a couple years later.
good,"*Dealing with the inbound calls, very demanding high spender customers"
good,"Nice place to work"
good,"Daily activities included fixing computer problems, managing financial plans and stock trades as well as meeting with clients."
good,"Solo estuve durante un par de meses, ya que realicé una sustitución, pero el ambiente y el método de trabajo me gustaron. Una pena no haber podido continuar."
good,"Make no mistake -- when they say it's gonna be rough, it's gonna be ROUGH. Get used to having snowstorms in other parts of the country make work hectic for days at a time while having to think outside of the box to get a traveler where they need to be all while following their company's policy. It's not easy, and it can be downright frustrating."
good,"My day would begin around 8/8:15am to determine any action requirements from the Japan Asia and Australasia markets.  Followed by action requirements for Europe Middle-East and Africa.  By afternoon UK time - the US markets would clock-in and work would filter through that required attention from the International markets.  "
good,Worked with early and late stage collections offering custom solutions to get account back on track to enable spend.
good,This job was sales volume driven. All employees figures were posted and updated weekly for all to see. Minimum numbers were required regardles of economy or call volumes. Time off was regularly posted on volunteer basis without pay to help reduce corporate costs.
good,"MY day starts with going to office fixing the appointments , meeting the prospective customers,solving the queies and selling the cards of amex."
good,Hectic day with lot of learning and experience while interacting with minimum two clients a day
good,El Trato con el Cliente no es directo se depende mucho de que el Cliente siempre tiene la razón. Eso nos colocaba en un lugar poco creible y mal conceptuado.
good,"Although I am just a contractor, my work is respected and appreciated by senior management"
good,Working in American express is a great experience.Its was a great learning there.My co-workers are very helpful with me.
good,"A typical day was me handling client calls regarding fraud"
good,"I worked in the NYC office as a Sr. Marketing Manager for the last 7 years.  Working at Amex was a great experience, I met so many passionate co-working thinking about innovation in the payment space.  One huge plus of Amex is the focus on the customer.  Really ingrained in the culture as well as the career opportunities. "
good,"I learned so much with American Express Platinum/Centurion. Met some great people. The most enjoyable part of the job is that we were always there supporting each others work. This was not a difficult job at all. I learned so much here. "
good,The starting rate is pretty good and the benefits are great. When there are changes and updates the management team should hold a brief meeting to ensure all understand. Not all people learn the same and if I am delivering a product or service I need to know all there is to know about the product. There is consistent call monitoring which is good it ensures you consistently provide excellent customer service.
good,I worked for American Express for 14 years in the Customer Service Disputes Department. I handled dispute claims with US cardmembers and Domestic and International merchants.
good,Meetings
good,Fast paced working enviroment. Call centre that never sleeps. Providing the best service to all customers with enquiries.
good,"Job was repetitive, but enjoyable because I was able to help people on a daily basis. I learned how to manage multiple systems and tasks at one time. Management was good, they offered feedback and support where help was needed in the advancement of the job. The hardest part of the role was working and being a student it didn't allow for much free time."
good,"Some pressure and Long Hours of work but contribution is recognized, Good work atmosphere, etc. Very Slow Growth prospects and difficult lateral movement."
good,"I think American Express is a great company. I just don't feel like their travel department is great. They advertise work/life balance but it is hard to provide that accommodation when you're working in a call center and your days off depends on service levels. Part of your bonus is based on how the team as whole performed. So no matter how well you performed, you still will receive a bonus based on your team. And if your team does not perform well, you can forget a big bonus. However, this is a company I can honestly say management is approachable and do not treat their employees as second class citizens. No matter their position, management made sure to welcome every new employee and was a visible presence on a regular basis."
good,Excellent benefits... Love the fact that I could work from home. Management was fair.
good,American Express provides a culturally diverse environment.
good,Great compensation program at the time however they laid off the whole 4k employee center.
good,"Sometimes the job can be a handful however the company has resources in place to help you cope with the stress. For instance they have quiet areas, and a gym to aid in releasing that day of stress"
good,"My day was 95% project related. I lead finance inititives that included involvement from different parts of the organization accross the U.S. as well as Canada, England, India and South America. It was generally high stress with aggressive deliverable timelines. I enjoyed the travel and working with many culturals. The most challenging aspect of the job was ensuring all communication was understood, and expectations were met, accross cultures and management groups."
good,"I found that American Express was a company that had an excellent reputation, and was a stepping stone to gaining experience to move up in your choosen profession."
good,We handled the Procter & Gamble account. We always got the support we needed in order to do our job. We were always told we were doing a great job. It was professional and I felt needed. I was on the management team in Customer Service. I wish I was still working there.
good,"American Express was a great place to work. It has great benefits, work-life balance (depending on your role), and has a great culture. I would say its only drawback its lack of promotional opportunities. Once you are in, expect to stay at the same level unless you have amazing charisma and ""networking"" skills. Hard work and innovation is rewarded with cash rewards, but not much else."
good,Management provides KPIs for your to follow your progress throughout the year and while you're with the company. Getting in the door is the challenge.
good,"The Environment of the company was good, people working there were polite."
good,"A good solid organization to work for.  They try very hard to please employees and try extremely hard to please their customers.  Depending on the team you are on, it seems fairly easy to make lateral moves within the organization"
good,I dont have anyrhubt to say about this job I'm just filling this in so I can start looking for work why are you making me fill this in blahs blahs bla
good,"Amex is one of the better companies to work for overall.  The benefits are strong.  If you are ambitious and ready to work hard, you can get somewhere if you fit the corporate culture."
good,"Amex is a good place to work, especially for those who appreciate flexibility and a friendly work environment. Pay and benefits tend to be lower than those of other companies in the same industry in the NY location."
good,"Dynamic work environment with a focus on training, development, employee satisfaction and diversity. Median compensation not always commensurate to job function."
good,Bonne expérience chez American Express à Rueil malmaison
good,I worked from home in customer care.  I also worked on the sales team.  Made good money but it was a typical call center.  Very busy with back to back calls.  They provided all equipment needed to work.  If you enjoy call center work and want to work from home this is the job for you
good,"Pleasant work environment. No discrimination against contractors. Good technology projects. Free coffee and tea once per day. Good locations. Sunrise, FL is a very good location. Close to Miami metro."
good,"1. New excitement."
good,"Normal workload, one or two projects at any time, flexible working hours, nice and healthy work culture. Constant change of management and management styles was a hard part"
good,"Politics around but good with tech used."
good,"Good work life balance"
good,"American Express is a collaborative and competitive place to work.  Considering the industry is finance and banking specific, decisions may have to touch various elements of the business before getting full approval for execution."
good,I loved the job quick pace my co workers was very good. I enjoyed the work load that was giving to me . The manager was very nice and helpful to everyone.
good,"Excellent benefits, dedicated coworkers. Contractors have difficulty converting to full-time employees, but FTEs have excellent upward mobility. Would recommend."
good,Just don't get stuck!! They management teams will help as much as you need. Use this as a step stone or strategically based on great benefits awarded.
good,"Pay is excellent, work from home for most roles. Flexible hours. The paternity/maternity leave is excellent if you have been an employee for over a year, other benefits are about average for the industry. Very much a ""what have you done for me lately"" type of culture and very limited opportunity for advancement if you work outside of NYC or are not able to relocate."
good,"its a great place to work just"
good,It was my first office job and learned a lot and was able to learn on job. It was a great experience and also way to get foot in door and gave me computer experience. They were very helpful.
good,The hours are great and they work with you if you need to change them. Great support from managers and other team members. Plenty of opportunity for growth if you want it.
good,I believe AmexTravel is intend a great company. My coworkers were awesome and my team leaders went above and beyond to help. I just think for what they want from us as travel care professionals deserves better pay.
good,"I have never missed one of my son's school events and that really means a lot to me."
good,"It provides good benefits such as gym, lunch and birth day free and people are friendly."
good,"Management is excellent (there are always exceptions of course). No pressure work environment. Fun and flexible workplace. In fact, in my humble opinion, everyone it too nice to everyone. Like you are in a perfect world."
good,"The American Express Company, also known as Amex, is an American multinational financial services corporation headquartered in Three World Financial Center in New York City."
good,"Ambiente professionale ma anche amichevole. Tempi di lavoro intensi, ma sempre rispettosi della propria vita privata."
good,"AMEX is an amazing company with a lot of great opportunities. The company offers many associate friendly programs and many departments offer flexible work schedule and work from home opportunities. The culture at AMEX is a god one, but, unfortunately is not always mirrored in  all departments. Often your success at AMEX is contingent on the department you work in and 'who you know' that can help you realize other opportunities."
good,"Career enhancement and development. Good people, and growth in career. fun workplace but no growth in salary and micromanagement sometimes. too long work hours are also a concern."
good,"American Express has great benefits for their employees and the pay is above average for South Florida. "
good,"Generally Amex is a positive place to work.  I happen to work for an amazing leader, but that being said our group has very little movement in or out.  So while the work is interesting you are trapped.  This is not true in many other areas.  Performance is on a curve, so you can do great, but someone else can do better, and you get nothing."
good,Environnement et cadre de travail modernes et agréables. Esprit d'équipe et bonne culture d'entreprise.
good,"I enjoyed working for American Express until the last few years there. Management style changed. Although I adapted it was a noticeable change."
good,Good place to work.  Very employee involved but constant calls for 10 hours a day.  Too much repetition for me.  Not enough variety.  Very micro managing.
good,"If you are willing to put in the work and play the corporate game it is a great place to work, The benefits packages have went downhill they use to be killer. the management is typical of the environment its all about the numbers. The training is top notch and the environment rocks as far as culture goes"
good,"This was a temp job so I wasn't familiar with how American Express works."
good,"A brand to work with."
good,Overall work culture is good. Learned a lot after joining this company mostly worked at client location. We have given enough power to take the decision and focus on our deliverables.
good,"Overall it was a good  place to work. It was great having onsite daycare and a nurse. The most secured position is  CCP. It was surprising to see the number of lay offs in smaller departments.  There were a lot of temporary positions offered, but very   few opportunities to career path into a new role."
good,"American Express provides excellent benefits for their employees and gives them the opportunity to advance.  However there are so many changes to policy and procedures that take place so often, employees barely have time to absorb the information when it changes again."
good,Work culture is varying depending on what process you working for. Some processes have a good scope for growth while some are just a rat race. The leaders and management are something that is not very convincing always.
good,"The company is fantastic and it's core products have served them well for so many years which is great to see and I'm sure they will for years to come but the business has some really innovative business units that struggles to get the focus needed to take it to the next level. The cross border payments/FX Sales business is a specialized unit that has performed tremendously over the years, the founding GM of the department, Paul Hargreaves, was fantastic at growing the business and keeping the teams engaged but alot of that has been lost since the integration within the wider business units."
good,"Overall excellent company to work for.  I have been in sales here for over 2 years. There is not a lot of room for advancement, but the culture is good."
good,"if you ever get a change, work with financial managers. I worked for a group of five, each with a different personality. it was great to learn the different ways to view your financial future. When typing financial reports (no one had their own computer at that time), I learned a lot of different ways to management your financial future, planning right now, and different ways as to how it was important, depending on the client. making sure you have a good financial future takes time, effort and a helpful financial planner. I worked with certified financial planners, and not. And everyone was helpful in educational and great to work with."
good,"Nice compensation plans for sales people that are very skilled (between base and commission), comfortable environment with decent co-workers, they do a lot for their employees between lunches & taking you to cool places like golf etc. There are a only a few bad apples as far as managers are concerned that are mendacious and lack ethics and may treat you however they see fit."
good,The company overall was great however nothing was ever done about a bully manager even after multiple complaints. Pay was great at the time (2012) however feedback provided was not always heard well by management.
good,Worked here for almost 8 years and It has a very welcoming office. Everybody gets along with almost a family like atmosphere in such a large corporation. Very regular bbq's and health benefits. Business structure is solid with efficient processes.
good,"Looking forward to the new American Express. I have been here for over 18 years. The people are great. The institutional knowledge  - technical and business - is unsurpassed. Learning the business, and the supporting technology, is an unparalleled experience."
good,"I was at this time senior travel counsellor, first thing in the morning we should activate our sign in the call set and be able to receive any calls. Being one of the business travel center, let us receive the calls , make the appropriate options for travel to our corporate clients. offering them flight booking, hotel booking, insurance, tours , transfers and visa as well."
good,"Great experience working at AMEX. Loved the people and the work environment. "
good,Good career growth / movement opportunities. Pay isn't very competitive but work life balance could out-weight. Overall a good place to work and foster a career
good,"The American Express brand is exceptional.  It provides instant credibility in the market place. Unfortunately, the company tends to approach the market with the strength of the brand, while competitors are investing in new products and technology that the market is requesting."
good,"- perfect work life balance"
good,"It was a great environment and I learned a lot in terms of accounting for foreign exchange, fixed asset accounting for the bank and its operations around the world and so forth."
good,"I actually miss working at American Express"
good,"Well paid, energetic and focused. Big business, big corporation and great expectations. The benefits were very good, the managers were very dime a dozen. Not very good with employee relationships, but very good with business needs."
good,"Aprendí a perseverar en mi rendimiento, logrando superarme mes a mes y a recibir feedback tanto de superiores como de compañeros."
good,Good place to work ; good for work/life balance but bad for career growth; management is not good; too much of desi groups don't feel like working in an american company.  They show their Indian attitude
good,"I worked on the phones for cobrand products which means you have a very stringent schedule.  Do not be tardy, do not leave early, pto availability is a bit rough when you need it.  People burn through sick time quickly.  It was a good job for where my career was at the time.  I'd do it again if I had to, but wouldn't seek out this job.  Rough part was monthly bonus relied so much on customer surveys that are out of your control.  Sometimes you only receive 4 surveys and one bad one tanked your bonus."
good,"Trés bonne ambiance au travail"
good,Great life/work balance with work from home policy. Work load can get heavy at times and will demand work hours outside of the typical 9-5. Culture is fairly collaborative and cross functional in nature.
good,American Express gave me my foundation for being a leader.   I enjoyed the people I worked with during the years I was there.   There was opportunity to move into different roles to keep on learning and growing.
good,"Fast paced and dynamic industry to work in. Great perks and we all worked hard as a team."
good,AEFA was a professional yet informal and very collegial place to work at. Had full support of management and flexibility of working in office or field.
good,"It was fun while it lasted. People were great, pay was good, awesome benefits, and the 274 hours of PTO was great.The training provided was excellent."
good,"fast paced work environment, great training, Manager work with you to build you call reviews. Have contest all the time between teams where you can win prizes or rewards."
good,"Very good learning but not much work life balance. Implemented Agile in my project first in my department. Managed a very bigger team and got AMEX chairman ""Project of the year award for 2015"""
good,Enjoyable place to work with excellent and bright people.  Too much process which inhibits projects to be completed at a extremely high cost to the customer.
good,"American Express had it all; cutting edge, developmental leadership programs with hard working intelligent work force.  The camaraderie was second to none and everyone worked together to make American Express an industry leader."
good,Great work culture. Work life balance was perfect. My manager was also very easy to work with and always fair. I enjoyed working with my colleges and would certainly wish to work for this company directly.
good,This was my initial position with a large corporation. I learned about corporate culture here which allowed me transition to other financial and marketing positions. I am very thankful to my mentor at American Express who allowed me the opportunity to go back to school and gain by BBA at Pace University.
good,Working at Teleperformance/American Express was a great experience especially in the aspect of customer service. There was a great amount of emphasis put towards positive interactions with the clients on each call no matter the transaction.
good,"There was a definite issue of consolidating the American Express staff with the Syntel staff. Additionally, there were cultural issues with so many people from offshore working for the first time in the U.S."
good,"Overall good experiance working with Amarican Express ,good learning from peers and senoirs,only issue which we faced while working there is they had done major re-structuring among the organisation and high rated voluntary retirement was done ."
good,"Hay buen salario además de varias prestaciones, pero es muy difícil conseguir una promoción y es un trabajo bajo mucha presion."
good,"The Amex culture did not fit the mold of the culture in a traditional bank. The environment was not cut-throat, people were respectful of other's opinions, work-life balance was good, pay was decent (not great), etc."
good,"Good place to work, if you have talent, one can fully explore themselves.  Good culture, good facility and ambience. Company does invest in personal upskilling by providing in house trainings."
good,"work life balance is very good, change is slow to implement and middle managers struggle.  It's a good company but several very good leaders have left the company and it appears to be a transition period."
good,"Good work life balance and health benefits. Little challenge to the status quo with high dependence on contractor resources from India. Work gets done and that's about it. Internal competitions (e.g. Hackathons) are fun but little is used from these in the actual workplace or business practices. Current management (CEO and EVPs) tend to play it safe and slowing the future of the company. Hardest part of the job is the red tape between departments, policy and procedure. Most enjoyable are the benefits, time off and salary."
good,Its a nice company but growth is very slow however the working environment and job security is good.I would love to work again in American express if i get better opportunity.
good,"I enjoyed my job at American Express. I felt respected and empowered to make value based decisions when doing my work and required little to no assistance with my job. I was able to interact with people on a daily basis and it felt like a family in my department. Our managing team was extremely professional and available to us at any time. American Express was generous in service awards, benefits, on site activities, community donations and allowed us to have a work/life balance. Unfortunately, my department was one of several that had a reduction in force and our work was sent to  another American Express location off shore. There was no option to transfer, so I became a displaced employee after thirty years of service. I would have stayed at American Express until I retired, if my job stayed in the United States."
good,"Nice place to work. Was on a part time job but enjoyed the atmosphere. Promotion opportunity was very good."
good,"Working with AMEX was a wonderful experience! There was quite the learning curve that was expected to be kept up with in the government affairs office, but hence why the position was so educational. Must have good time management skills and the ability to learn quickly."
good,"American Express has a balanced workplace culture and has a lot of activities planned out throughout the year for employees. The job could be many as responsibilities include dealing with card members/merchants financial handling however American Express culture makes work easier to handle. "
good,"American Express training is excellent and it is done all the time."
good,The company offers many benefits and has endless opportunities. There are are many opportunities to hone skills from different departments. Would recommend the company to anyone that can withstand working in a cubicle.
good,"Amex has provided good skills, and i have acquired many knowledge from most of the department. "
good,"American Express is a good company to work for with good benefits and pay, Job security is not very good due to outsourcing and frequent quarterly/annual cut backs."
good,"My time with Amex in reservations was tolerable only because I was surrounded by colleagues  that cared for me and encouraged me to stay.  Once people began to leave, my department closed & I wasn't  allowed to move to a desired department I was uninspired to stay.  The job function is to multitask, outstanding geographical knowledge, maintaon a calm voice in tome of stress from Cardmembers and above all do it all in 30 min or less.  I wasnt going to short sell customers  who where used to my outstanding service.  Thus I had to leave my passion for travel."
good,Awesome company to work for however very hard to move up within company without knowing someone who knows someone. The company is great to work for but once you are placed on the phones its hard to get off. They will post positions just to cover themselves legally but already have the potions given away.
good,Amazing company to work with. You can definitely make a good career here. Work life is a bit hectic. They have amazing incentive plans. Office politics is an untouched devil in this organization.
good,"American express is a fast paced work environment that does pay well, however there is not a lot of job security.  due to the issues in the overall financial market they do skimp and always seem to be doing cutbacks."
good,"Like most employers, American Express is only as good as your leader.  I have experienced the spectrum, from managers that were into self promotion to managers that believed in building your career. I learned a lot about the true meaning of being proactive and self motivated.  I have never been truly into office politics, like most, but I did appreciate the value of growing relationships.  "
good,"· Managing corporate client accounts."
good,"It was a good experience working at American Express. Good thing about the project i worked is that we use the latest technologies which are not used in other projects across the organisation. "
good,"American Express focuses on work life balance. It is employee friendly with good team management across various departments."
good,"Like many companies, AMEX relies far too much on outsourced, contracted talent and does not concentrate enough on hiring and building internal loyalty of technology workers. In my department, this has resulted in shifting priorities, poorly-architected solutions, and little knowledge transfer. That said, when those of us who have some clue come along, we are blessed with much freedom to affect change, improve process, and educate co-workers, customers, and other consumers of our technology products. Also, AMEX is *not* a technology company, but has very good support for the attempts of those implementing technology to succeed. "
good,The company is great the job is a challenge. The worst part of the entire experience is the customers. The policies in place for customers does not foster a positive experience for the employee.
good,"American Express is good company with great benefits.  Company provides work and life balance, in addition to other benefits such as purchasing an extra week of vacation."
good,"AMEX is a very diverse company to work for. I enjoyed the benefits of a flexible work schedule and work from home privileges."
good,"Ability to work from home.  Time management and being receptive to feedback are the keys to success at Amex, as well as great sales skills.  Paid time off is abundant.  Customer survey grading is not fair to the employee.  It is not clear on the surveys that they are grading the representative, not the company.  You can offer excellent service and be dinged for it because the customer is unhappy with a policy or procedure that can not be altered or changed by the representative. The hardest part is you basically train yourself."
good,"The leadership is reasonable. Respectful and trust in the team environment."
good,This job was though to get into as I barely had any sales experience. It also made me a good Sales Representative as I learned from hard working people.
good,I work from home. I still have an opportunity to interact with my team through instant messenger and webcam during meetings. The call volume is sometimes back to back and then breaks in between.
good,"When on the phones, pay close attention to what the company is working toward. If your not relevant you can find yourself on the outside looking in. Attention to detail and follow your leadership closely"
good,American Express is as good a place as any that I have worked with. The environment is great and so are the people. They could use a little more transparency though.
good,"Since the product itself is quit esteem in terms of target clientel base,it gave an opportunity to meet wealthy people.Visting new places and companies premises for promotions and putting small stalls was fun as well learning."
good,"Americans Express is a great place to work and build your career.  They have a in most business units, a flexible work environment and great skill building opportunities l.  However, employees need to have realistic expectations in terms of what their potential growth is in the company.  This has not been the case for me and it has led to many disappointments.  Also, some leaders may not be as direct with you on the true prospects of your career at American Express.  Oh her than being clear and getting an understating of where you stand as an employee, it is a greatness place to work and build the foundations for your career."
good,I worked for Amex for five years it's an amazing company that values its employees and with great respect for their work life balance. Very good vacation policy plus additional five days off for five years of employment! Now they have introduced paid extended maternal leaves and paternal leaves for its employees.
good,"I enjoy all my interactions with my coworkers, clients, internal and external, including management. I take pride in my job and our clients are my main focus. I have built very strong relationships with many people over the years."
good,The Team i am in is fantastic. It's really amazing team to work with. American Express is known for its brand. I am currently working as Training Coordinator.
good,"Work pace is really nice and worth ."
good,Nice company to work with lot of benefits and employee staisfaction. Best place to work for females. Awarded best company to work with many times in India.
good,Day starts a bit early here to make the most of it. Generally starts with a team hurdle assigning daily tasks & meeting in the evening to conclude the day.Amazing administrative policies & other incentives for the team. Fun place to start your career.
good,Overall a good work experience but I am trying to move forward with a new career that they couldn't offer. Amazing work ethic found here.
good,They should consider rotating people for the weekends so that twice a month you get a weekend off.  The scheduling is at times not fair because of the client you're given. Once you start working more clients your scheduling gets better
good,I have worked for American Express for over ten years and gone through a lot of changes.  I feel it has been a great job but I feel that employees get lost because of how large the company is.  I have worked in many capacities with American Express and feel like it is time for a new adventure which is why I decided to go back to school to pursue my Bachelors degree.
good,I was a B2B representative assigned to a Medical company for an American Expresses Procurement program. This was a great position that was 60% travel. There was a satellite office here in Las Vegas that I was assigned to and the corporate hub was in Ohio and my American Express office is in Phoenix. The client relocated outside of Las Vegas and my position ended.
good,This company has closed and is out of business. While they were in business they had a fine reputation and I really enjoyed working there. The owner has retired.
good,"I enjoyed my employment with American Express.  They offered many benefits and ""extras"" to their employees.  They made it a fun place to come to and enjoy your job.  The call center in Greensboro unfortunately closed."
good,"My only real beef with AmEx as an employer, which I consider a big one, is that over the past several years they have done employee reductions a few different times.  This makes for a very stressful environment when every couple of years you don't know if you will have a job or not.  It always comes down to the bottom line and keeping the shareholders happy because if the company isn't making that extra $100M then the only way to make that up is to lay people off.  Three times I was a victim of layoffs, twice being rehired after some time of being unemployed.  My hope this time is to land with a smaller, established, local company that will allow me to grow and have a higher sense of job security."
good,"Excelente empresa devido a valorização pessoal, bons líderes e liderados....Excelente empresa."
good,its a very good place to work if you're a student or as a first job the holiday system was not very good though you could never plan anything in advance
good,"condition de travail correctes"
good,I had a very challenging work environment where every day was full of surprises with new work. I was lucky to have a team which supported me. I would like to recommend my friends for American Express where they can learn a lot.

good,Overall working at American Express was quite pleasant.  I had the opportunity to work with smart individuals who had shared values and worked towards the same goal.
good,Dealing with foreign clients was interesting.  I learnt about different cultures and different foreign currencies.  My co-worker was really good.  We got on well with each other.
good,"I have been with American Express for 3 years now. I have learned a lot about the banking industry and how to help people in a calm manner."
good,"Overall a good experience. Work and life balance is good. Management is average."
good,"Great company indeed. Sell and buying foreign currency, and also doing western union transfer, telegraphic transfers and drafts."
good,"AmEx I would say is a great place to work. Although it is a diversified environment, once can feel the warmth. The atmosphere is friendly yet professional and there are great opportunities for career advancement.As an analyst, I could bring in value to the business with constant improvements and the support of my peers."
good,does not treat everyone equal which is a big issue... if not good with reporting managers then that creates an issue and career will be at stake... apart from that everything else is awesome....infrastructure and facilities are very good and top notch....has good name and fun place to work...
good,"While I was at Mash Management I had great experiences there, however I was not to fond of the hours being I was there till 5 in the morning.  I like working during the day."
good,I found it to be a a very good environment to work in.  The good ol boy Management system was hard to deal with at times.  I would have liked to have had more opportunity.
good,"Uma empresa de nome forte no mercado, a qual me orgulho de ter feito parte."
good,My association with American Express is nearly 15 years.  Started at the Team member level and ended my career as Service Delivery Lead.  In the 15 years with Amex was able to have a full circle of all the departments in various capacities and learned the nitigrities of Card Accounting and reporting.  Also had the experience of managing 120 + people which in-itself is a unique experience.
good,Overall a pleasant place to work. People are generally friendly and the job is challenging enough. Plenty of opportunity to learn from different departments and gain leadership.
good,"Monitoring calls and analysing whether the call parameters were met. Being a part of the team training and mentoring the newcomers. Handling escalated calls relating to customer queries and resolving disputes over the phone."
good,"Typical day at work requires a few meetings. Although most analysts work independently, there is a lot of collaborating taking place to meet business needs."
good,"-Les journées étaient bien remplies d'un point de vue charge de travail."
good,"I enjoyed speaking to professionals all of the United States that were American Express members.  I was able to speak to people we see on the television, and in the movies.  I was able to talk to business owners who were just opening their business doors.  "
good,"It was a team environment and we had fun competing against each other for prizes, pizza parties, etc. The hardest part of my job was not being able to help a cardmember. After investigating and analyzing every inch of a dispute, it was hard for me to not be able to issue credit."
good,"Very rushed.. lots of pressure to get clients on and off the phone."
good,"It is a great place to work , in terms of rewords and recolonization"

Your job is to reduce user friction with the interface by determining flow patterns, how a program might be used and how best to design and place features to accommodate a user-friendly interface."
good,très bon environnement possibilité d'étendre ses connaissances régulièrement grâce à des formations
good,"Great company that is expanding at a fast rate. Has a great product that is extremely advance in the offering to clients."
good,"The work was fine, a bit heavy on the bureaucracy.  The application period is long with incredibly detailed background investigation. I personally really disliked the open office work space.  Employees in rows with no privacy and constant distraction from surroundings."
good,Good work place with supportive colleagues with team work spirit. Learned and adhered to a different work process. Not very long working hours.
good,"being able to take trips to better your knowledge to upsell. There are alot of stipulations to get your bonuses. Including getting surveys from customers, which could make you lose your bonus for a 4 month period."
good,"Overall, it is a god place to work, the management is 50/50. If you are lucky enough to get a patient Team Leader than you are lucky. Lots of clicks, only certain select agents are privy to be allowed into the inner circle, getting written up is a common form of discipline, whether it is our fault or not.The incentives are good, to get but easy to lose."
good,"Great management development program. Balance  between Job work and Life is taken in high regard, The employee is recognized and rewarded for a job well done."
good,"Enjoyed my stay with the company and how they dealt with their employees. They were able to sustain the needs and create an atmosphere that will make employees feel that they are the ones responsible for the success of the company. The company provides constant assessment and surveys on how things are doing from Management, Health and Medical benefits, Salary, and working conditions. This measures how well the company is doing in terms of providing a warmth and satisfying stay in the company. Love the company and the people in it."
good,You get to work with people of various workplace experiences. The wealth and breadth of knowledge is always encouraging and contributes to getting the job done.

good,It is a huge organization with great work ethos. Have ample of opportunities to learn and grow within organization.Employee centric company with great exposure of corporate environment to all the employees.
good,American Express only knows the word Excellent.  Excellence is expected in all areas of their business.  Co-workers were wonderful and could be expected to help each other at all times.  Individual statistics had to be met.  The calls came in one after another and it was very satisfying getting to know the person on the other end.  This was the best part of the job.  I worked with Program Administers who were the ones that handled the American Express card for their company.  I spoke with a lot of the same people everyday so really got to know who I was speaking with.  This was one of the most stressful positions I have ever had but also one of the most rewarding.  I retired and moved to Missouri or I would still be working there. I loved my co-workers and the people I spoke with on the phones.
good,Amex is a great place to work and I would highly recommend it.  Employees must be able to collaborate well as that is a key piece of the culture.
good,"Overall, good experience. Good pay, but not much opportunity for growth. Excellent tuition reimbursement policy. Many layoffs make you feel unsure about future."

good,"A great place to work and very good benefits as well. However, sometimes not all practice what they preach. Talking about growth mindset vs fixed mindset.  The company has come a long way since 15 years ago. Has a good work life balance as well.  Worked with a very tenured organization."
good,I've held multiple positions in the Global Travel Department. The most consistent aspect is competitive pay. Great training.

good,"American Express offers flexible working options for multiple groups. The management has always been friendly, and interested in helping employees create their own career path. American Express is a wonderful company to work for. The hardest part of my job was finding the time to get involved in all the company has to offer.

Management there was friendly and courteous.  Coworkers there were very fun and lively.  The hardest part of the job was upselling, but I was always able to meet my goals.  What I enjoyed most was the work environment... very informal and comfortable.  I was there as a temp and quite enjoyed my time there."
good,"AXP is one of the best companies to work for. It is very good to increase your leadership skills, travel to USA and interact with different cultures"
good,"As a Subject Matter Expert my day can consist of : •	"
good,"Work at American Express has been a great learning process. A typical day at work would start with the sales target that needs to be set for the day for the team. Since Amex is a credit card company, the applications for the credit cards needs to be scrutinized and checked thoroughly before sending it to the head office. Some of the applications would be approved and a few declined. The declined applications had to be reviewed and some of them were discussed with management and sent for reconsideration to the head office."
good,"my day starts with a huddle, where agenda of the day is decided and work accordingly. I learned how to deal with different types of people and maintain my stamina throughout the day. management is always available in need. we work as a team and help each other. most hardest part of my job when I do graveyard shift. Most enjoyable part of my job is when I am stressed and we have various activity on floor like different indoor games, painting, etc which acts as stress buster."

good,"I worked for AMEX back in 2012-2013 as a Customer Care Professional.  The management was supportive all the way through training and on the floor.

good,"Management is very professional and knows how to treat employee properly. Ability to grow within the company."
good,"Out of all the agencies out there, Amex is top notch. They still have fams and free hotel stays - the perks are good. Not so easy to make bonus but not impossible. It would be better if management came from within or they hired people with actual travel experience. Most agents are highly knowledgeable and well traveled. The training is excellent."
good,"While the company is great to work for, they can be a little misguided about the mission. They are constantly making changes to the commission structure of the division, and they also changed the culture of it  by revoking salary and making us hourly employees. That made it seem more of a call center vibe instead of a business consultant vibe.   The benefits were amazing however, I can honestly say I have not work for a better company benefit wise"
good,"Some meetings, some developments, some decision making, some visionary talks, some fun activities, ping pong table and quiet environment to work in. Saves a lot of time to focus on other skills in life."

good,"Great training program, good relationship with all co-workers. Competitive environment. Bonus program. Recognition and awards program. Good structure."

good,Overall 12 years experience with same company but worth it as it has offers work life balance and transparent management who share all about business very clearly.
good,"Let me start by saying Amex is an amazing company with super smart, humble, people who are more than happy to give you their time and help you with whatever you need to learn. It can be a bit passive aggressive, depending on the department, and like any large company there are politics and unwritten rules, but no company is perfect."
good,It was a pleasure to work at American Express the people was pretty nice decent it was small and the CEO was excellent and still there to today 2018 you get a chance need to work at American Express

good,"I really enjoyed working at American Express until they downsized. I always appreciated the ability to learn and grow within the organization. Amex offered the ability to take classes and attend trainings for upskilling. The culture was professional and focused on attaining goals. When they downsized, they lacked a plan when and expected double the work."
good,"Human resource is the best in this company. Much emphasis on people and their well being. Afterall, employees are the ones running the company. Would like to work again with American Express I could get a chance."
good,"Very fast pace environment, Lots of support, Great place to work if you are interested in traveling over the US and Europe. Travel to a destination is a requirement sponsored by the company. Management a little aloof."
good,The job is very demanding and requires a lot of hours weekly to maintain performance levels. The people and the culture are top notch. Blue Box values drive the organization and it's decisions.
good,Great place to work. Work hard and you will be recognized and rewarded. A leader in Diversity Awareness and training. Mgmt open to feedback to improve processes and improve employee satisfacion.

good,Good place to work and grow. Relaxing atmosphere. Collaborative Culture. Wouldn't even have thought of leaving if it's not for a temporary role. One of the best companies
good,"American express is good organisation but they wont provide much benefits to employees"
good,"Customer service oriented culture throughout, both in- and outward facing. Highly demanding but also highly collaborative environment, reinforced by the new leadership top down."
good,"Great work like balance, but hard to advance. The culture is highly political, so if you don't have a leader that is well-connected, you will stay in your current role for too long. Some people that do get to advance are not the smartest people at the table."
good,I had a unique role at AMEX and I was able to grow and learn. People are smart and hard working. I enjoyed my job because I got to work with other financial institutions. The work was challenging and I was on call 24/7 but I enjoyed it. The culture is good. Like most major organizations there were a lot of meetings.

good,"-American Express has given me a lot of opportunities for me to groom myself. I learn to work with different kind of people who come from different culture. I do received multiple rewards and attractive incentive through employee reward and recognition program based on the hard work i have contributed. I would suggest and recommend my friends to be part of the organization. The engagement activities throughout the year are anticipating, fun and unforgettable. In a nutshell, i would like to say thank you American Express for giving me a chance to work in such a great place."
good,"Loved working in an office environment with Amex however when the travel offices were closed nationwide we had to work from home."
good,If your on the phones all day it can be stressful. Metrics are pushed heavy. Some are easy to obtain while others are sometimes out of your control. The pay is more than reason for what you are doing.
good,"Probably one of the best corporate cultures that exists."
good,generally american express will provide a secure workplace with possibility to progress if you network and work hard at it. Like any other large american organisation there are good and bad points.
good,"Still happening and making it difficult for employees to have a future or any security there. "

good,American Express provides great opportunities to grow and change job without leaving the company. Leadership potential is recognized and promoted at all levels and sky is the limit for anyone who wants for work hard.
good,"Company/industry is going through many changes, company is in defensive mode, and risk taking has been curtailed.  That said, the company has committed to taking care of employees, even in this difficult climate, and I have never seen a company in the industry, or in my experience treat employees as well as American Express does.   Relatively lower pay compared to peer companies, but great work life balance."
good,"I had the best team, bosses, time at this job!  I was there for almost 10 years and made many friends, learned a lot and gained a lot of experience and knowledge.  I was the Executive Administrative Assistant to 4 VP's (one at a time).  Each had their own leadership style & personality.  The most difficult thing was making it through the lay offs.  In the almost 10 years, I made it through 12 layoff cycles and was caught in the 13th.  Part of the reasons behind the ever moving teams is the fact that the financial world is not a stable, solid world.  Where there need is, the people get moved to/from areas to support/supply the need.  One of the things I learned from working at Amex was to be flexible and resilient.   I loved my teams, co-workers, VP's, Directors and the work I did.  Benefits and holidays were good too... but if you can't handle the shuffle, get off the boat or be left behind.  If I had the opportunity to go back... I might, but I'd have to really think about it..."
good,It was hard to work there every year they had billions to save and so they would lay off people and outsource just to save any money that they could. The job was always wondering when your time is next
good,"Overall, my experience with American Express was positive. Their product line was extensive and operating systems were well maintained, dependable and user friendly."
good,"Good company' culture, good atmosphere. Very strong brand. Your work has a concrete impact. Very easy-going persons and open-minded. Persons from all around the world"

good,"Good project management techniques being used. The workplace culture is excellent, particularly the importance provided to diversity. Great place for exposure to various technologies."
good,American Express is a great place to work and the Sunrise campus is beautiful and the people are friendly.  It is a large corporation and it can sometimes feel like getting ahead is hard because there is so much competition for roles.
good,Good organization to work for.  Career progression and new opportunities available.  Good work-life balance. Felt remuneration was below market but opportunities provided did make up for this.
good,"This company is a good company to work for and I really miss the people I worked with. There were some good and bad, but overall they are a good company to work for."
good,This is a fantastic company to work for as it truly cares about employees and the work/life balance. Support was great from HR during transitioning from one account to another.

good,Its a very nice place to work with very good work culture. Lot of exposure to new technologies. It will definitely be a place for those who are eager to learn new things
good,Co-workers  are wonderful to work with and a great support system. The most difficult part of the job is executive leadership. There is a pendulum effect where changes swing far right and far left.
good,Most of the employees have a long history with the company. The positive definitely out weighs the negative but with any company there were a few annoyances. I worked there for 11 years and would have stayed longer if they didn't downsize my department.
good,"As far as big corporation jobs go, this is one of the better ones in my opinion. Although most managers are managing people working jobs that they themselves have no idea how to do, there are a few who take the time to learn. As with any corporation, you will have some micromanaging and some amazing managers. You will have to deal with typical corporate changes and shifting, but they compensate well."
good,"It is an awesome company to work for. Absolutely fantastic environment."
good,"Excellent company to grow your career, Amex is devoted to internal movement and progression.  Large global company, must be able to work with multiple groups in multiple locations."

good,I felt this company treated you with respect and recognized your strengths and weaknesses.  They encouraged you to improve with additional training.  Management worked with employees.
good,American Express provides you with an incredibly friendly and trusted work environment where management does not always feel the need to look over your shoulder and make sure you are working.  They provide you with enough time to enjoy a good lunch and enough time to complete all work that needs to be done daily.  Management is very involved in projects assuring that you know they are there if you have any questions.  There did not seem to be any truly difficult part of the position I worked in.  I simply enjoyed coming into work and being able to work on my own or with my team on the project I was given.
good,"llegar a a la oficina  por la mañana agenda citas, asistir con los clientes, cerrar venta"
good,"American express is a nice place to work, the environment is really good. It pays well to the employees. Leaves and maintaining a balance in the personal and work life is challenge. Most important: Job security is a concern as the performance is measured and monitored on some unrealistic and uncontrollable parameters."
good,"Amex takes itself as a company very seriously.  Their approach to projects is very organized and functional.  It is a very large company with opportunities to grow and move around for good performers.  Their corporate and brand image was not achieved by accident.  Like many financial organizations, they are a little bloated at the management level, but most positions seem to be filled by very qualified individuals.  If you like an organized approach to work and consistent processes, you will like it here."
good,"American Express gets a very big negative rap for higher pricing, but it was my job to explain to"

good,"awesome work experience."
good,Good people to work with. Opportunity to lean more about finances and future building skills. Flexible work hours with a good balance between work and life.
good,"American Express is your typical corporate giant and because of that, there are many layers to management, slowing down some key business decisions. Despite this, it has been evolving to a technology-focused company. I also think the company is very supportive of work/life balance, which is a huge plus and actually increases worker productivity."
good,"A typical day would be to review and make contact with Customers to investigate incoming queries and investigate finance discrepancies. Those being either manual errors or system generated issues within the TM1 / Oracle systems or issues with the Citrix Server environment.  I enjoy problem solving, organization and interaction side of my previous role.. Every day was always very different and can be particularly demanding with many queries coming in from all over the world. Prioritizing each issue was vital to ensure all items could be resolved as soon as possible.  It was a great Job and we would support all of our users out of UK hours she that be required."
good,Good learning culture. Great work Environment. Management is supportive. Only cons are difficult to get promotions and salary is low as compared to other companies otherwise it a great company to work with.

good,"Enjoy working directly with customers and positively impacting their business. Management cares about a work-life balance, but don't misunderstand - we still work lots of hours! There is some flexibility though in when those hours are worked, which is really great for family life and charitable activities."
good,"You can set your own schedule, and also have two home office days at week."
good,"Good company to work for with excellent benefits and competitive pay. At times the communication between business units could be ALOT better, especially on projects where multiple areas are involved. The organization does seem to be a bit behind its competitors in many ways except for service to its customers, in that they are tops. Management is a mixed bag, some are incredible to work for while others seem a bit out of touch. The best part of the work though is seeing the impact you have on customers whether it is internal or external when things go right. You can make someone's day/week/month based on how the organization does things. Above all, they do put people first in almost everything which is refreshing."
good,"American Express has been a great place to work for many years and is currently undergoing extensive change in the marketplace.  I work from a home office and schedule weekly appointments, conference calls, implementations, underwriting and facilitate ramping up accounts."
good,Jag trivdes mycket bra med både kollegor och ledning och jag saknar mina arbetsuppgifter som i stora drag bestod i att hjälpa kunder att komma på fötter med sin ekonomi.

good,co-workers pleasant and helpful.   sometimes stressful but rewarding when customers were given assistance; ability to work/ learn other depts./functions
good,This company being a financial institution taught me a lot in terms of work management and time management. The most enjoyable part of the work was the recognition given by the company to each of the employer. I grew each day with the knowledge provided by both trainers and the company. Overall a very good and genuine place to get experience which would benefit any employee in his future endeavors.
good,"This is a very challenging job that is quite rewarding. "
good,It is a great place to work. I enjoyed going to work everyday. Everyone works hard and is still very happy to be there. Everyone in leadership roles has an open door policy and always willing to talk and help out if available.  Everyone knows everyone and if you did not know who the leadership was then you might not think that they are VPs and SVPs because they all dress down and work with everyone when necessary.  Leadership is always trying to make the workplace as enjoyable as they can.  There are quarterly Town Hall Meetings to let everyone know what is happening.  Everyone is very friendly and helpful.
good,"Good company ,nice ambiance, work  life balance is great, has three shift for working."
good,"A typical day at work is using sales tactics to stop people in the Ottawa airport and convince them to use American Express cards. I learned how to talk and deal with many different kinds of people. Management was constantly monitoring our sales and checking to see everything was running smoothly each week. The co-workers were nice people and were team players, which is great for everyone. The hardest part of the job was stopping people in the airport since a low amount of people dislike being confronted by strangers. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to people and the amount of freedom with the job. I love meeting and talking to new people, which allowed the job to be fun."

good,"I was only here for a one week work experience, however i gathered that it was a very busy work place, however I enjoy working in busy environments. From word of mouth I heard the management was very good. Unfortunately didnt get to witness this as i only worked there for a week. Most enjoyable part of the job was understanding and learning about the Banking world."
good,"Really good learning and exposure "
good,Overall a great place to work with strong support from leaders and peers.  Benefits and work life balance are amazing!  Strong 401K match and profits sharing is a huge bonus.
good,"Talk to about 100 cardmembers a day and resolving the issues  brought up or providing information required. Good rapport with co workers and supervisors and a happy place to work in.Always keep in mind the requirements of the company, this will help to keep on top of things. Hardest part is dealing with customers whose issue cannot be resolved due to the companys policies or procedures. The most enjoyable part of the job is once you leave for the day you do not have to carry home any work with you"
good,"Work life balance is  great and benefits are ok, but there are lots of politics and favoritism when it comes to moving ahead."
good,"Great company for working parents. Lots of flexibility - work from home widely accepted; generous maternity leave policy; paid time off and sick days."

good,"It was a good work place, and would like to work for Amex again if possible,"
good,Nice place to work with good work culture and work life balance but low salary.
good,Great place to work the Top Client Group focuses to much on analytics and not enough time on growing the new business.
good,"As stated above, great people, great culture. Management is very understanding and responsive to your needs. The team I worked on is very supportive and helpful. Of course I enjoy the Wednesday breakfasts but the most important factor is the challenging yet rewarding and comfortable work environment."
good,Its a great experience to work at American Express. Lot of things to learn. iT ACTUALLY LIVE THERE BLUE BOX VALUES. Only disadvantage is that it it is in Gurgaon and you get stuck in traffic jams daily. Also growth is slow here.
good,"This area worked with clients accounts where travel related expenses were charged to their account. We each had a portfolio which we ensured the accounts were up to date, customer satisfaction maintained along with payment related duties eg allocations, chasing payments, reconciling and following up disputes.  Unfortunately a team of 42 was reduced to aprox 20 and non customer contact related functions sent off shore.  My role changed and due to internal issues I was provided an opportunity to  look after an offshore team, providing training, coaching and quality assurance.  I worked very closely with management building the team and creating trust between the local and offshore team.  I had a great team leader where I take my inspiration and hold as a role model."
good,"As this is my first job, during the course of time I really learnt a lot which would be helpful for me in my future jobs."
good,"A great culture, the day I chose to leave was one of the hardest days in my career."
good,"The work environment was great, management was great and overall I really enjoyed working there. Training and advancement was a huge plus."
good,I have had the opportunity to work for American Express on two occasions.  Both offered complete training and a culture of success.  There goal was to help you succeed in all aspects with American Express.  They were committed to your well being..
good,Worked here for 2 years was going great until brand new manager took over whom was new to the managerial role. Seems forced to prove themselves worthy of position by micro managing.
good,"My job entailed dealing with customer account enquiries for all American Express cardholders - whilst also offering them upgrades on their services if available. Management was very supportive and proactive in helping us achieve our sales targets. My co-workers were  very nice people. The most enjoyable part of the job was doing a good day's work and achieving or exceeding the targets set for me by management. The downside of the job was the weekend when a lot less staff were on and, usually, parts of the computer system were being upgraded. This would have a detrimental effect on our ability to perform necessary task for our customers. I left this job only because my marriage broke down and I was in the final stages of a messy divorce."
good,"Fun place to work. and learned lot of strategies from managers ."
good,"This was one of my first internships. I was getting insights of the professional world. I learned a lot here. I remember one typical task at this internship.I was in the accounts department, working with my supervisor. They had give discounts to certain preferred clients. In order to calculate that discount percentage they had go through a long method. I managed to shorten that procedure by at least half time. I was really appreciated with the fulfilment of the task."
good,"Very supportive management, a good brand to work with, transparent job culture."
good,Interesting concepts and always on leading edge of innovations
good,A day of work at American Express was enjoyable and kept my mid stimulated. I worked with a wonderful group of people who kept the day exciting with a good balance of sociability but staying professional and making sure all targets were met.
good,entreprise jeune équipe ouvert et concurrence accrue entre les vendeurs fond de cette boite un des liders en sont domaine de prédilection qu'est la carte amex ;a l'intention des voyageurs a petit comme a long courrier.. l'aspect le plus difficile reste encore le nombre  extraordinaire d'appel passer dans une journée type qui avoisine les  presque 500 !! hormis cela et le fais qu'il peut sembler parfois répétitif il n y a pas un prospect identique ni une journée qui ce ressemble car parfois ce sera émission d'appel et d'autre fois réception d'appel le management et assure par une équipe plutot jeune et sur d'elle rien a en redire...
good,They care about there employees. Great work/Life balance. Family oriented culture
good,I learned so much in my 20 years with this company. I was laid off 3 times and return to work there as they are one of the few travel companies that still offer retirement benefits.
good,"Identify accounts that were delinquent and recover 80% of debt."
good,"Every day you learn something both outside & at work. Day starts when the alarm clock start ticking in the morning once you reach office your brain starts working to deliver what your deliverable are your SLA's, BAU etc etc. Multiple task at the same time co-ordinate with your team members, Higher management, Meetings to clear the Doubts and check the project progress.

good,It used to be a very good work place.  Now you are just a number.  There is no more integrity.  Great benefits.  Had the opportunity to meet a lot of good people.
good,"Having worked here for a few years, leaving and choosing to return, I have found the culture is one of a kind. People treat you like family and understand in most cases that we have a life outside the office and attempt to be as accommodating as possible. As with any call center, it is metric based and driven by numbers.  There can be a certain degree of stress involved that can trickle through the office but overall the general consensus is that of a good environment. Pay and benefits are unlike any other place of similar work in the area."
good,Its nice experience to work and learn in this account which developed me to grow professionally as well as personally. I would like to take more challenges and willing to learn more.
good,Productive workplace with excellent staff management with clear roles and responsibilities.
good,"American Express provides a great amount of working flexibility (work at home arrangements, flexible schedules, ample PTO, etc.), excellent opportunity for advancement and a strong, stable financial footing as a company.  The company has been in business for 160 years and will likely be in business for 160 more, so there is a certain level of comfort in that.  Pay and benefits are above average, if not spectacular."

good,Great place to work with job security as to maintain work life balance
good,"Ebb and flow in work levels, but highly stressful at times. Job requires independent thinking but at the same time, one has the support of different departments and personnel to achieve your goals. The hardest part of the job is handling irate passengers during storms and the most enjoyable is training in new systems and fellow co-workers."
good,"American Express was a fantastic place to work, the Credit UK Team (Corporate) was where I worked and it was truly a great environment. The day to day grind is to be expected, handling the financial capabilities of high level company officials does tend to come with angst, but the management were supportive and helpful, my co-workers welcomed me in straight away and were on hand to help if I struggled. The hardest part of the job is trying to understand people's situation, some have family members die or extreme financial difficulties and its hard to remove your emotions from the situations, but alas we had to remain impartial. I really enjoyed the people at Amex, not just my team but the whole building has a warm and friendly touch, it's a shame that it was only 6 months on a temporary contract, but I wish all at Amex the very best."
good,Great company to work for that provides work life flexibility. Challenging work environment and top notch talent and individuals.  Innovative and fun.
good,"Although I am very happy with Amex, the sudden an drastic changes have caused some concern"
good,"- bonne ambiance de travail"
good,Direct customer contact is the best part of the job.  The continues changes not only with keeping up with the Airlines and other vendor but with the dynamics of the drive of the company.

good,"collections is just not for me, however its very laid back casual atmosphere"
good,This was an exceptionally great company.  All co-workers were excellent and the best team players.
good,The ability to work from home and remotely manage direct reports was both challenging and rewarding.  It was an opportunity to become self disciplined and learn and manage a work/life balance.

good,"typical day at work consisted of making sure your card holders understood the importance of monitoring their accounts, reassuring them of the fraud protection unite was always watching their account, if there was a concern we would contact them, if there was fraud we would cancel the current card and send them a new one, we would never hold them responsible, would issue them a new card and that the card would be there the next business day, depending on the day of the week.  if there were any questions that they could contact us any time and we would address their concerns.  The most enjoyable part of the job for me was I got to meet (via phone) so many different types of people, learned a lot of additional information on what the card holders did in their jobs, met so many wonderful people.  the hardest part of my job was having to cancel card due to fraud when that person was just leaving for another country, or on vacation. But we tried to resolve any issues for them. Management also was there for us to bounce any ideas on how to resolve issues quickly.  I learned that no matter where you were in the country, what income , or what age you are your are still a target for fraud. "

good,The focus on world class service and performance was great. I love working in that environment.
good,"Process orders to be delivered to corporate clients. After the CLO has left for the day, follow up on payment from clients. You have to manage your own job in every way - to make sure you do not waste your time with queries from clients. Some co-workers always offer to help, some only do what they are suppose to....but that you find anywhere. The hardest part of a job is to have a rude customer. The most enjoyable is when you win them over or sort out their query and they are satisfied....so that, they only want to work with you in future"
good,Contacter des clients qui n'ont pas activé leur carte ou qui n'ont pas renvoyer tout les documents nécessaires à la création de leur compte. Vendre des cartes aux clients.

good,"When I started with the department the majority of the managment team had no experiance in a claims processing environment. For the 2 yrs I was there everything was under constant change. Everything from the metrix to the claims process and interpretation of the policies and even the hours of operation changed. As a result of this I have learned to be flexible in my avaiability, my approach to the claims process and ability to apply new interpretations of the policy as directed."

good,The best thing about Amex is employee recognition and memberships to diversity teams and more.The salary and benefits were fair. Training provided was useful and ongoing yearly.
good,"Up to Director level there are good opportunities for advancement through recognition of your skills. You have to push, if you wait to be recognized you will be waiting forever. Internal pay policy makes it beneficial for you to switch roles as often as possible which can lead to a lot of churn in staff. VP and above is more often than not about personal relationships with the hiring leader so you'll need to manage up."
good,"I liked that American Express has so many different divisions and groups.  Thus it was easy to work at the Company for a long time, whilst moving around to new areas to be challenged and learn many new things.  The bonus part is that the previous job always helped you excel in the next position as work flows interfaced."

good,"The company is good for fresher who wants to start his or her career sales."
good,Most jobs at Amex have pretty decent work/life balance. They have one of the best paternity policies out there but salary isn't comparable to market - it's a trade-off you'd have to make.
good,"I was very proud of my time at Amex, where I was given outstanding opportunities and delivered great work with amazing people.  I will say that their culture in technologies is changing for the worse as leadership wants everyone to be a coder and losing business knowledge, strategy and architecture.  Hopefully the pendulum will swing back once they see the continued challenges they are creating."

good,Working at American Express is an enjoyable experience. At time I wish there were more colleagues from my generation. I would imagine the average age of employees is quite high. Networking is a huge part of the culture.

good,Awesome company to work for. Great benefits and pay. Great options when it comes to schedule to help you with work /balance. The company makes you feel like you are apart of a family
good,American Express has a good culture.  The pay is very decent and you can work from home.  The only complaint is it is very sales driven for cross selling & sometimes it loses it's customer first focus.  It is a culture where the sky is the limit on how much you make base on your sales.  Its also constantly changing leadership.  You may change Supervisors every 6 months & bidding for hours are frequent as well.
good,You had alot of opportunities to improve your experience and education.  They would acknowledge your effort.  Benefits were very good.  I loved learning new skills every day.  They do not support virtual- remote location as much I would like

good,"Strong marketing teams, overall good culture and nice facility. Compensation and team activities are a bit low - at least when I was there. It may have been due to the loss of the Costco contract."
good,"My experience with working for American Express was mostly an excellent one.  The majority of the leadership I worked for was very supportive of giving and receiving feedback for the improvement of any given project or work environment.  I was treated like a professional and thoroughly enjoyed my roles as an Individual Contributor.  I however never worked in the ""phone environment or call center"" and understand that entails a different work environment.  I also was compensated competitively.  I would recommend anyone take the opportunity if given it to work for this Fortune 500 company as it is in the top 100."

good,"American Express, needless to say, has the best offices in all of India. Even though I would usually work on evening shifts, I would often face issues with the traffic. To and fro from home to work, it'd often take 5 hours. Work was great, however, because of the nature of work, I would not get much time to learn new technologies. But you are given enough breaks to loosen up and have some of the yummy cookies and tea. All in all, management and managers are reasonable and wonderful."

The EAs planned many of the team's quarterly events which included a vast amount of charitable work. Whether it was to clean up the City Parks, Plant a tree, aid at Soup Kitchens, Big Brother/Big Sister relations etc., no matter what, the entire department volunteered. I was also impressed at the Company's Diversity and its Cultural Environment.  I myself volunteered in several of these events.

I learned effective sales techniques, active listening, how to connect with people on a personal level, and how to ask discovery questions without being too invasive. The management was mediocre to good. There was a manager (who is no longer with the company) who had a vendetta against anyone who didn't perform to his expectations. He fired a lot of people who didn't deserve to fired instead of coaching them to improve their performance. Otherwise, the management was good overall. I loved my co-workers. A year after being laid off, I am still friends with many of them. The hardest part of the job was staying informed about changes in processing procedures - they changed all the time! There was a lot we had to know about Amex's partners, and that could get overwhelming and confusing, because those programs often changed too. The most enjoyable parts of the job were training classes, my co-workers, and the satisfaction of helping a customer understand a confusing program or get them into a card that they loved and could take advantage of."

good,"As with many large financial organizations, pay is supressed and there is a tendency to lean to the side of micromanagement, including endless meetings. Amex encourages learning new job skills and advancement, and provides good equipment and work conditions for the most part, including a game room. The employees are nice and the work is hard. If wages are not a high priority, you will enjoy it, but be prepared to be emotionally spent at the end of the day. Of all the financial institutions I've worked with, this one seems to spend much too much time on performance appraisals in relation to the low wages they offer."
good,"Despite the fast-paced atmosphere of most of the jobs the company took care of it's employees. The compensation packets, bonuses, benefits, perks, and incentives were all geared to encourage loyalty to the company.

I've been learning more about UX design since I've been sitting in on design meetings, participating in design sketching sessions and involved in user testing where I was able to hear live feedback. A few of the managers check in daily or weekly to see live demos of prototypes that I've built or have general meetings regarding the team's status. My co-workers are fun, creative, driven, passionate about their work and detail-oriented, something I've always looked for in my working environment. The hardest part of the job is that our design team does not work on the premises as they're not AMEX staff but a third party company.The most enjoyable part of the job is my creative co-workers, being given the opportunity to try my hand at UX design and learn from people who have been in the field professionally for years."

Once in a while you have to be on implementation calls over night."

good,"American Express provides a very busy work environment.  Your days are filled with back to back client calls.  Solving problems on small business and personal  accounts in the same call could be challenging based on the call handling time required versus the time the clients required.  Business clients in particular are already working on a packed schedule.  As a representative of the ""brand"", I preferred calling them back at a specific time with their permission or   leaving a message on their voicemail concerning the outcome of my research.  Most calls did not require a callback. My co-workers were always excellent working as a team backing one another up with questions and answers on instant messenger. The hardest part of the job was being patient with an irate client by letting that client vent briefly then taking control of the call respectfully.  The clients were also the most enjoyable part of the job.  Solving their account issues while building a rapport was very satisfying."

The organization has taught me everything of how the credit card industry works. I have come across multiple teams involved in making one simple transaction. Learned the back end work. A single day would be comprised of interacting different teams, Directors and VP's and exchanging ideas everyday. Getting those ideas implemented and gathering funds for those ideas would be the biggest ask. You get to share energy with different people and get to laugh and enjoy the winning moments."
good,"Yes, work-life balance is really good in this company but work is a bit restricted within a team and for personal growth you need to grow horizontally by moving in other teams."

good,Working at AMEX was a great experience overall.  I loved my co-workers and the whole virtual work from home experience.  I'd still be with them if I didn't have such a bad experience with the manager I was assigned too.  She made my time there very stressful so I decided it was better to part ways.  I wish I'd stuck it out and then I would eventually been moved to another department.  The pay was great and so were the benefits.

I've learnt a lot from thee leadership I've worked with, I've enjoyed the working culture in the office. Almost everything here the best one can dream of in a professional life.

Although there are ways to escape this boredom but not very promising."

They have new products and new ideas, and this will be a great place to work.  Expect constant change and frustration in the meantime."

good,"I would start my day at 4:30pm and immediately begin taking calls. I would adhere to my scheduled breaks and end the day at 1:00am. The calls I would service are incoming calls from American Express card holders that reside in the United States of America. I have an extensive knowledge of credit card laws, both in the U.S.A. and in Canada, and I use this knowledge to ensure I provide accurate information to the card members that call for assistance. I have learnt a lot from this position and have been able to use it within the company and provide fellow Customer Care Professionals with accurate information with my time spent assisting our Supervisor Team. During this time, I would log in and be there primarily to assist other Professionals if they needed the assistance, and I would also take escalated calls. I appreciated that this job has challenges, some times different challenges every day. Every situation is different and they can not all be handled the same way, which is why I had to use my previous and newly learnt knowledge, and utilize the resources available to me, to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of information."

good,"American Express was easy to work for because I believe in the company, the product and the people especially upper management who was very interested in personal development. There were no hard part to the job. It's all in how you perceive a thing/situation. I chose to be positive at all time. I don't thing personally and I don't wear my heart on my shoulder.

In the cafeteria we had a few restaurants that were also working round the clock. American Express had their own transportation system in place for their employees, we would be picked up and dropped back after work. In conclusion, it is a great opportunity for fresh graduates to learn and experience a fast paced environment with ample possibilities of advancements."

good,The work place culture is very diverse and becoming more collaborative.  The pay is not geared toward promoting anyone or providing incentives accurately.  There is a lack of advancement opportunities but great benefits which may keep employees comfortable for too long in their own roles which can be  dissatisfyingfor some .

good,"A wonderful workplace for over 18 years however, the direction of the this organization is cost margins and outsourcing any skill-set that will provide a temporary lift to stockholders. This organization has laid-off over 12,000 employees since my arrival in 1995.  It is just more practical to issue H1 visas for overseas talent at a fraction of the cost. This I a wonderful organization who in my opinion, may be disillusioned by the global workforce."

Enjoyed my family based work place and collegues which made me feel like coming to work i believe the hardest was not being able to turn that certain customer around if I felt would really benefit from the product. Although was able to try alot harder and work harder."
good,"I go in with one or more goals everyday based on priority. Then, at the end of the day, I realize that I have not accomplished a single thing that I had planned. Instead, putting out fires/dealing with phone calls & e-mails/solving other people's problems/helping other people meet their goals for the day/meetings take up the whole freaking day!

The best part of the job is talking and having fun with the co-workers and friends, all from various backgrounds and coming together and helping each other out."
good,"I worked for American Express as a Travel Counselor for 10 years booking corporate travel for a large tobacco company in NC. I enjoyed my job, my coworkers and the business travelers.

I found out later they were going to hire me again but because she said I was a No Show they would not do it when they did the check. I could not prove it at that time and she no longer works there.

good,"Working at American Express gave me insight into the day and life of a small business owner in America.  I enjoyed learning how top earners in our country use a credit card to save money in their business.  Working at AMEX mean bringing your A game every moment of every working hour.  This was due a major part of my performance was based on the survey results from customer interactions.  At times it was difficult if a call was transferred to you and the customer was already upset with the last representative or their issue wasn't resolved by the last representative."
good,"It pays you well. Great Ambience, Employee engagement activities and work culture. Promotions are a challenge unless you are a bold and beautiful girl. Management sucks though."

good,"If one are ready to take on the challenge, than its a place like no other. Competition is cut throat as they bell curve in every process and incentive is based on this. if anyone does not perform they are asked to leave after the PIP. The best thing i liked was that there are so many processes that one can easily find something they like. It's quite vibrant with people always around."

good,"A great company to work for with a brand name that speaks for itself.  Each day I would set a goal of visiting at least 50-75 small business, selected days earlier from a company issued tablet device. Time spent on each stop varied, some were quick, while others took more time. A quick visit would already have proper POP placement of the AMEX logo on front door and on cash registers. Taking a picture of the Amex logo was sufficient for this type of marketing call. A lenghty visit would include waiting for a decesion maker, explaining  the features and benefits of AMEX, build rapport, and execute propper POP placement concluding with a photo. Sometimes management struggled delivering important job tasks from corporate decision makers to the team in a timely manner. Our team was filled with great people! Each month we would get together for a night out, and time spent with the team was great in boosting everyone's morale. Working for Amex was rewarding, and a great learning experience in the marketing field!"
good,I enjoyed working as an outsourcing specialist for American Express. My primary roles were the solicitation of charge card products and services. My role as a business consultant was to make sure that customers were paired with the correct charge card. I used to make certain that customers were paired with the correct charge card product by reviewing their spending history and matching their spending history with charge card benefits or cash back rewards. The spreadsheet based analysis that I used to perform was designed to help the customer maximize profitability.

good,Estar en contacto con directivos de bancos y clientes de alto poder econòmico.
good,"I would recommend working for American Express. The finance department and culture is great. It encourages learning different areas, cross training, cross learning, and movement, which is not always the case in other companies.  It values when you have knowledge that is not all from a single line of learning.  There is a lot of re-orging so that can be stressful bu if you are good, and have a little bit of luck to go along with it, this is a great place to work."
good,"I have never grown so much than during my time at American Express. I was challenged, and made a lot of great connections. Plus I had the opportunity to make an impact. It didn't hurt that the then CEO (K.C.) was a really down-to-earth leader that everyone respected and admired.

Contract work ended suddenly without prior notice from the last manager (terrible experience). Ended at the worst time in our economy which resulted in long unemployment."
good,Stress on innovation and being agile. Collaborative work environment and employee friendly. The work hours were flexible. A bit of repetitive and reinventing the wheel kind of work.
good,"High expectations but great flexibility in the work environment.  Partnership based work environment, relationships are key to success.  Relationships with key business partners, team, and overlap with other technology teams.  Success is based on working together."

good,"I held a variety of jobs working for this company which was great. I was able to learn and grow everyday. The clients were nice and I enjoyed the office team. I was very proud of my office team. We made our deadlines and help advisors all over the market group. I initially set up how we would do our technology and marketing areas. We did well and other market groups were interested in how it was done. Then, our home office wanted to streamline the marketing and took back the distribution and allocation process. This made it very difficult for us to obtain the numbers we were getting. My hands were tied by home office and I could not find a work around to please the Group Vice President.

Over time, I became very experienced at analyzing and summarizing suspicious financial activity over a dozens of product platforms, drafting hundreds of well articulate Suspicious Activity Reports which were submitted to FINRA.

Options in using the cards, are always provided to clients. This is to make sure that the best customer information and product assistance is served every time, anywhere in the world. This I think is the reason, why even if the company stand alone, not merged with Visa or MasterCard, maintain its prestige and high quality value in the credit card business."
good,Altijd met veel plezier naar mijn werk gegaan en toen het tijd was om door te groeien werd ik hier aan alle kanten in gesteund. Als ik niet naar het buitenland was verhuisd was ik heel graag voor deze werkgever blijven werken.
good,"Good company to work for, however very little opportunity to really grow in the travel division. The other areas..i.e card, marketing, banking are much better for personal growth"
good,I spent good 10 years in the company. What a journey and what learning experiences. During the time i was there the leadership was phenomenal. The salary could be better.
good,"American Express, as a global, Fortune 100 company, provides a broad spectrum of career opportunities.  It excels in the long view for business strategy, which contributes to its long history.  It provides a wide array of products and services, which also contributes to its long-term success.  Innovation is at the top of the list of its organizational values.  Because it is such a large company, the employment culture is diverse, site to site and business unit to business unit.   That provides employees with multiple opportunities to choose their path within the company, rather than be stuck in one area.  The company invests in leadership development, enabling new leaders to accelerate their success in leadership effectiveness, also contributing to a high level of employee engagement, where new leaders are nurtured and supported by mid-level management.  There are ""back-water"" areas that have lower success in creating a high-engagement work environment, but employees don't have to leave the company to find better areas to work."
good,"Just another day in the office bestond met name uit gesprekken voeren met leidinggevenden en medewerkers. Conference calls HR collega's in het buitenland en het beantwoorden van de vele e-mails die er op een dag binnenkwamen. Omdat ik de enige HR persoon was voor 150 medewerkers verdeeld over diverse locaties in Nederland bestond mijn werk een zeer breed palette aan werkzaamheden. Dat varieerde aan de kant van het spectrum het aanmaken van een nieuw personeelsdossier en aan de andere kant rond de tafel zitten met de ondernemingsraad. De meeste energie kreeg ik van het coachen en een klankbord zijn voor collega's. Het meeste vervelende aan de functie vond ik de beslissingen die voornamelijk in de Verenigde Staten werden genomen, waarbij amper rekening werd gehouden met de europese/nederlandse wetgeving. Ik komt tot mijn recht in een 'jij-cultuur', een oprecht ""open door"" policy beleid, een transparante en communicatieve omgeving waar alle onderwerpen, zonder consequenties, benoemd mogen worden. Opbouwende en gefundeerde kritiek is voor mij synoniem met betrokkenheid en engagement"
good,"American Express is a very family oriented.  The hours are flexible, the benefits were awesome.  Love that they train you for whatever position that you work and never be unaware of the job that you are doing."
good,At Amex you are working with a big Global company with a lot of support from all over the world. You also have a lot to learn as there are a lot of LOBs in the company and you will have opportunity to more around if you find your path. The only down side is there are some politics here and there and you need to know what to do to avoid being involve in trouble.

good,American Express has top products and service.  Great Diverse environment.  But many cut backs annually so not a stable environment.  Each fall you were nervous you were next.  The restructuring was based on geography or tenure not sales performance.

good,"Good company to work for overall good pay and benefits,the HR department is great and management is good. The IT and technical folks were excellent and could help you through any problems. They will let you go at the drop of the hat with no explanations."
good,"This is a brilliant organization. Preferably, get your experience from a company like genpact, Barclays etc, which groom you to be corporate ready and then join amex. Amex is not training centric, but provides an amazing environment to work and earn."

A gerente quem me ensinou a ser mais paciente em esperar o momento certo para angariar novos patamares. Os colegas sempre foram muito incentivadores. Era complicado alcançar algumas metas de qualidade mas todas monitoria era um novo aprendizado. O mais agradável era a convivência no ambiente de trabalho.
