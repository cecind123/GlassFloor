rating,review
bad,"It’s very political, a lot of drama. You can have a position and then it seems to always get taken from you. Management is awful, raises are a joke. A lot of micromanaging. Run the opposite direction"
bad,I worked at discover for a very long time. I worked in many different departments under many different types of mangers. Some were good. I enjoyed my time.
bad,Thay seem like a great  company at first but then you get in and management doesn't  care about the well being  of the employees. I felt mocked by my supervisors often. I worked there for 2 years and had 4 different  direct managers and out of them one didn't  follow up on anything. Two of them treated me like a toilet on and the last one  did not care about his team at all gestarted on the district
bad,At first it will feel amazing but then there will be no way to promote yourself if your black stay away they say their inclusive but they only have one black manager across 6 departments
bad,"Great environment until they realize they can’t control you and make you be exactly like them. CORE is the worst department, if you don’t fot into their “all inclusive environment “ then they will get rid of you, felt racist in there at times as well"
bad,The training is reading to self on line and getting on phones after reading each book. It’s 3 books to read. It’s not a consent schedule after training .I really don’t like the self governing training. I don’t feel it’s helpful. They also do not pay enough. It’s just a job until I find another. The worst job I ever had. Trying to hurry and find something else.
bad,I never worked with a company so unorganized... they act like they care for their employees but truly don't. The turn over rate is incredibly high for a reason..
bad,"The hardest part of the job is the lack of support. They like to portray training, advancement,etc but the reality is its all politics. You will not advance unless you are a ""teachers pet"""
bad,This is the worst company to work for. They do not value long time employees. They change things on you just like that with little training and expect you to just pick it up. There is a lot of favoritism and if you don't kiss butt then you will get no where. I would stay has far way from this company has possible.
bad,"i don’t recommend discover financial services one as i did temp services their over ten years ago and can’t be rehired and did nothing wrong i worked above and beyond for them. however someone i know has been with this company for over 20 years and many people worked with them same scenario once you hit over a certain amount of longevity with the company they find anything and everything they can go railroad you out of the company. they throw so much down your throat to say to customers that it is too much for an employee to do to a customer on the phone. i don’t find that to be customer service when you hound them to try new things or offer new things. when a customer says no means no don’t force it. "
bad,"Discover is not a good place to work at if you are looking for a career. Management has no clue what they are doing or what direction to take. The company cares about the customer more than you, everything is biased and based on the customers perspective. The growth opportunities are not present at all like they claim. Being on the phone all day with no chance to even get up at the desk without being yelled at. The stats are all graded based on someone else so it’s their perception. How the calls are graded is super picky, the meetings are the same over and over again nothing new. The reason this company shouldn’t be on your mind for a career is because you should strive for something better and where your voice will be heard. A company that respects your opinion and ideas, this company does not do that at all"
bad,They weren't very helpful when you told them that you needed help they try to assist but would act like you should know everything and made you feel dumb when you asked a question.
bad,"Recently there have been additions to our ranking metrics as recovery agents.  Prior to these changes an agent was graded and ranked based on their % to seat cost and call quality/business compliance stats.  Now we are measured against our peers on a scale that includes added metrics' all of which are scored individually.  Call quality' % to seat cost AND future money.  I understand completely the seat cost % AND the call quality and agree that those metrics should be scored individually.  Currently we are being stack ranked against our peers and if you fall into the bottom 20% of the department you are placed on a corrective action path leading to termination.  Future money is a bit questionable......why should a rep that is consistently at 100% or better in the aforementioned metrics (seat coat % and call quality) have to worry about corrective action  AND termination if they are performing the job they were hired to do..??  "
bad,I hated the job because It was super boring and inactive. All you did all day was talk on phones and there was never any down time. You had less than 3 minutes a day to use restrooms etc
bad,"Hired for certain shifts, and ended up being scheduled all over the place. The scheduling that you were hired for was not what you actually worked and made it hard to accommodate."
bad,Results don't matter; resumes don't matter there. Education doesn't matter there. They treat everybody as expendable. If you don't automatically love Discover they will treat you as a leper.
bad,The turn around in that place is unreal. Has to do with poor management and lack of love for their employees. You’re not a person there just a number they pay.
bad,awful company take  150 calls a day and chained to desk all day  awful management unrealistic expectation there’s a reason they’re always hiring. Think twice before applying
bad,Discover is where you go to have your soul die. You can't advance unless you are willing to suck up to bad managers. Pay is low and expectations are ridiculous and you are not given the tools you need to succeed. Each manager will tell you something different and when it's wrong you're to blame.
bad,Typical Call center.  Favoritism and gossip among senior staff.  Attempts to bring happiness to being a call slave prove unsuccessful.  Theres nothing fun about taking 150 calls a day.
bad,Upon being hired at DFS I learned how quickly they change their policies just to have something to change. They don't treat their workers very fair. You are glued to a cubicle for 10 hours a day.
bad,Did not like the work culture there.There is so much politics and only people who play politics will grow there.Educated and motivated people are not liked.
bad,Discover felt like High School. I was required to time my bathroom visits with calls coming in. The work life balance was horrible. I would not recommend Discover to a friend!
bad,"Not positive.  Felt voice was not heard. Constantly felt threatened of termination.  Was wrongfully terminated, then lied to.  Statistics are impossible to keep up with."
bad,I left before my training was even over. I was in my first trimester of pregnancy and almost lost my baby and they threatened to fire me for missing ONE day to make sure my baby was still alive.
bad,"Very Cut-Throat Company"
bad,"Back to back to back constant nonstop phone calls, customers yelling at you nonstop, management stressing you out, absolutely a hostile work environment. Supervisor tells you you'll have a coaching that day, and then cancel it due to high call volume, yet wonder why were performing badly."
bad,Everyday I went into work I absolutely dreaded it. These people want robots. Room for advancement seems impossible unless you're really friendly with someone higher up. Would never recommend someone to work for this company.
bad,No good management team and training and they treat contractors like homeless people and like they are not appreciated and worth anything. They value only upper management.
bad,You basically get worked like a dog to be told every week that you arent doing good enough because you forgot to do something when being told to do it another way. Too many chiefs and not enough indians.
bad,"They put alot of pressure on you, and play favorites it's very stressful dealing with angry people on the phone and the supervisors not really wanting to help"
bad,This place is a joke don't do it even if its a last resort it will have you suicidal and borderline psycho. Management is a bigger joke and Team leads are a joke all fake.. no advancement unless your a snitch. this is the place to be if you wanna be verbally abused
bad,"They have many Temp's and contractors working for them, Contractors and temps are treated like dirt - you are excluded from everything  - if they have an event temps and contractors must sit and work wile FT employee's go to events and such - terrible company would never work there again!"
bad,"Freezing cold work environment, had to wear coat, long pants, socks & bear paw boots to stay warm "
bad,"after they get you into the company they don't care about your well being. They only care about the company. You will be back to back calls all day unless you are lucky enough to go to web support, which they don't let people go to. They don't care about good stats, they promote people with stats that are worse than yours."
bad,sucks to much drama needs to have better managers and less socialization I don't want to type anymore and you are making me do this so I can move on to find a better job. this is why discover sucks.
bad,If you value a a fair work/life balance and fair treatment this is most definitely not the place to work. I would not recommend this place as a career choice for anyone.
bad,The place itself was cool but the managers were absolute garbage. Good luck trying to have management listen to you or even just hear you out absolutely pathetic waste of time is what they are
bad,the job requirements versus the pay was not sufficient. there was a lot of favoritism going on although call center environment not pleasant experience
bad,"This job was customer were behind on there bill.  So we have to call and explain why we are calling,  The customer forgot or didn't realize they was behind on bill"
bad,"the job was not fun, and the hours were horrible, and there is hardly any room to grow unless you know the right people. The were many things i say that could be made better."
bad,"Lovely facility in New Albany, OH.  That's about it.  Pay and benefits are terrible, training is lacking, and people consistently dress like they crawled out of bed.  There is a difference between business casual and just plain sloppy.  There has to be a gym and a cafeteria (both very nice) because essentially you are in prison during your shift.  Can't look at your cell to see if your elderly parents or child's daycare called.  Breaks, during which there isn't enough time to eat, check your messages, and use the bathroom are short and aggressively monitored.  You can use the restroom 3 times a day...during first half of shift, meal time, and second half of shift.  God forbid the coffee you need to stay engaged kicks in.  Even after all of that, some people love it."
bad,"Worked there two years and never heard the same thing twice from a  "
bad,"They were so great to me before I was pregnant then everything changed once they found out. If you weren't on the phone a specified amount of time a day, you could get fired."
bad,"I love to work and want to learn any thing news."
bad,"want a stroke, heart attack, mental health illness. This is the place to go. No matter how hard you work, they find fault so your commission drops. Don't have a weak bladder. The most enjoyable part of the job was walking out the door."
bad,I loathe coming in to this place every morning.  I would rather swallow shards of broken glass then go into this festering rats nest of backstabbing double talking managers and employees.  One week they say it is one way the next day it is another and each time they are out to demoralize and screw the employee over.  AVOID THIS PLACE!!!  I have been shopping for a new job like a mad man.
bad,I started working in late 2013 and it looked very promising from all the things they spoke about. Later I found out that the schedules are made up daily although they give you hours when hired. I had to rearrange my entire day just to accommodate The work schedule. Discover doesn't care about family life or even sickness. My children were sick and I had no choice but to call off and I got wrote up for that. Every day from there just went down hill. Not a great feeling when you've been doing this for 12 yrs.
bad,answer customers calls related to their discover card how to be very patient and to understand customers concerns didn't see much of management.  We all were so busy with calls didn't have alot of time to inactive with co-workers i overall loved the job
bad,"recieed incoming calls, "
bad,"This is job is not for the long term. I worked here for almost a month, including training. It was the worst job of my life. Truly, if you can, find another job. The training was easy but after that it's a very unfriendly place. The management is hourly and their money depends on your ability to work like a robot for hours on end. I will never ever work at a place like this again unless I were desperate, again. When I first moved to Ohio, I was homeless and needed a job fast. This was it. But I'm so glad it's over. Best of luck."
bad,"Blance transfers, customer service, and selling products."
bad,"It all depended on who you know, talent and skill were not a factor.  There were several people that were paid and never showed up to work.  There was no remote working."
bad,"Training was great, and the company seemed promising, but things quickly went down hill after that. Got on the floor and realised that several things I learned from training were inaccurate.  Management is hit or miss. I started out with 2 great team leads, but the third was what eventually prompted me to leave. Strict reprimands for mistakes, but insufficient coaching to prevent future incidents. I also had a member of managment make several offensive comments and nothing happened when it was reported. "
bad,If you decide to work for discover you will have less time with your family period. The calls are constant and  you don’t have a chance to even drink a glass of water before the next call comes in. Help from supervisors is next to nonexistent and the benefits are subpar. If your between jobs and desperate take the job if you have options and want to have a life stay away.
bad,Comments and promises upon hiring to training and production were never seen through by the company. The amount of huddles a day that go on are ridiculous.
bad,Since the higher ups left now management is firing left and right for simple stuff. Managers show favoritism and the pay is barely livable. You have to be on the phones no matter what if you need to use the bathroom you have to clock out. My manager wears whatever and sent a girl home because she was wearing tights when my manger wears worse. The managers talk to you like you’re a child.
bad,"Over the past couple years management and product direction have lacked clear and innovative vision. The culture is existing in silo's, no new ideas are launched, management is very clicky, promotions are awarded to friends and there is minimal scope for advancement. New features take months and years to rollout, people do not stay in same position, so there is a rotation of knowledge and as new person comes in they want to reset goals, KPI's and project details. "
bad,"There is absolutely no toom for advancement at Discover , no OT and no flexibility ..Discover has great employees abd the ability to work from hkme in certain positions"
bad,Horrible and I’ll never go back. Management never took care of issues. They didn’t staff the department sufficiently had people work a night shift one day then a 5am morning shift next day.
bad,Discover does not care about their employees. It isa very stressful environment and you are required to be on the phones all day.  you can only be off for break or lunch. If you have a bad or long call you must just deal with it they will not give time off phones. Do not go out on medical leave or you will be fired upon return.
bad,"My direct manager and a couple team members quit shortly after I joined the team.  The senior manager had no idea what to do.  Eventually I was the only person supporting a massive application and platform.  After I left, there was no one to support the application.  The rest of the dev team was termed and the application/platform was decommissioned."
bad,Management was awful. Never rewarded for hard work. They had their favorites which in turn allows their favorites to not have to work putting the work load on the other employees. They claim to be breast cancer advocates but wouldn't allow time off for me to meet with my oncologist. They claim to be family oriented but wouldn't allow me to attend my terminally ill mothers surgery. They took all new hires PTO away. They target individuals. It doesn't matter how hard you work you will never be rewarded. I heard West Valley is great though but would highly recommend you avoid working for the salt lake location. The drama is high with the employees. They have nothing nice to say about anyone.
bad,"- watch your screen and listen to every call you make. "
bad,"I absolutely loved the job I was contracted for. Discover was in the process of restructuring their process, and organization was very unmanaged. We didn't have a manager, and when we did, they were thrown into the mix."
bad,"This by far is the worst company I have ever worked for. In the beginning they pump you full of pipe dreams about the advancement opportunities, only to find out there is no room for advancement. The supervisors and department managers have been there since the beginning and therefore leave no room to advance. The management philosophy is complete indifference to the employees. However, there is one way to advance that is to sleep with someone in upper management. Discover is not sympathetic to work life issues, so if you have children or school obligations do NOT work here because they will not be sympathetic at all. There are also serious racist undertones I can remember a department manager calling employees monkeys. My favorite was being told if you don't like it quit. Do not work at this company; turnover is extremely high."
bad,Management there is only there for the money so they only care that you succeed so they can get paid more. Supervisors talk behind the agents backs and cause drama. You get criticized for not being a top agent.
bad,very micro managed. very stressful having all calls reviewed and scored. I always felt that I was not at my best due to coaching and constructive criticism. I began to think about the job when I was off. Anxiety so high that I had to force myself to go.. Miserable place for me.. I didn't have what it takes to work there. No time to mingle as you are expected to be on the phone all day.
bad,the company cares nothing for you if you work in collections.They make tons of promise about oppurtunity to move up and it's non excistant. They will let you jump through hoops with no intentions of moving you or anyone else up. It's a way of getting you to do more for the compny at no extra pay. The work is soul crushing. contabtly calling people who are past due pretending like you have reviewed the account and really you started looking at it the same time you started talking. i have learned to not trust my leaders what so ever. they claim to help but knew nothing. they do not hold up there end of the bargain on helping develope and improve at the job and to sr manegment that is all your fault.The most enjoyable part is just my co workers on the phone. lots of great people.
bad,"Their idea of training is to have you read their trading program, with no interaction training. Put you on the phones and demote you when you get something wrong, by publicly humiliating you by making you move desks to the “dunces” cube. So that you can be trained at that time on what you did wrong. Instead of training everyone on that before you get on the phones."
bad,"It’s an ok job if you need something temporarily"
bad,"Entry level job, secondary pay not a primary one. They don't appreciate employees. Not enough time off phones. They don't back customer service representatives up."
bad,If you don't mind being replaceable and meaningless but need work and benefits this could be a good place for you! Management is subpar and goals are ridiculous.
bad,"Would not recommend to anyone, management is inconsistent and they indirectly age discriminate. Rude aggressive behavior is allowed by leadership. Work 11 hours and weekends"
bad,You are expected to not get up to use the bathroom unless you are on a scheduled break/lunch.  Various stats all have to be met or will be written up.
bad,"find somewhere else, you'll be on phones nonstop, and be reviewed on extremely specific yet subjective rubric. pay isnt worth it really. ................"
bad,"My experience at Discover in the charge verification department (aka fraud) was totally negative. Team leaders treat you not like a human being, but like a slave to squeeze and/or a number. They use threats and scare tacticts to get those under them to comply and meet stats. Too bad it's all a lie and a joke: those who are well-connected or are their favorites take far less calls than regular agents. There were a couple of these sitting next to me, and even though we'd all ""sit in green"" (be available to take incoming calls), while we'd get 5-6 calls in a row, back to back, these slackers never got any. When this was brought to the team leaders' attention, they denied this was possible and swore that everybody got exactly the same number of calls. Only they didn't. Straight out of training I didn't get the support I needed, and it was sink or swim at that point. I felt overwhelmed by the back-to-back calls (on average, you'll take between 60 and 80 calls per day in this department), and so eventually I decided to quit."
bad,"Standard working environment but with poor assistance with onboarding process. Left alone to  find information, difficult to get colleagues to put time aside for you."
bad,"I have spent the last year and a half at Discover, and for a while there were ups and downs. However, as of recently I have nothing but downs to speak of. The wages are higher than the industry standard, but for what we have to put up with, it's not enough. They preach all of these ""values"", just so they can throw them in peoples faces when they disagree with a idea or practice. It honestly feels like like everyone in management feels holier than thou and would rather talk down to you and make you feel small, than have an intelligent, adult conversation about really anything. They won't work with you if you try to switch shifts, raises are based on who you know not what you know,  and the only reason they pay people as well as they do is so no one will be able to leave once they realize how terrible this company is, because they have already become accustomed to a standard of living that another call center job cannot provide, and the place is so understaffed it is ridiculous. Instead of hiring more analysts, there will be days where hundreds of calls are either left stacking up or are totally abandoned, because everyone who takes calls is so burnt out from the constant back-to-back unrelenting ridiculousness that even with answering one call immediately after hanging up another does not make a dent in the queue."
bad,"everything is schedule which is nice but they make sure that you enjoy your job, they make sure that everyday is a day to enjoy your career and not just a job you come and go to."
bad,Always going through change. No respect for people's feelings or time and service. No scorecards or way to fairly judge managers so they go off who they like this week.
bad,"At best, salary and benefits.  At worse, often cut-throat with so many manager changes, there wasn't a consistent strategy of leadership.  It depends on what department, however.  Some are clearly better than others.  I personally, didn't have a positive experience."
bad,"They do not pay for what other employers are paying.worked graveyard shift and they pay you a shift differential, however you also work six-additional functions and work mail are not paid for it. Even after exceeding my statistical exceptions for a year, my raise was .35 cents, after working there eight years."
bad,"Wow, where to begin. I'll keep it short. If you're depressed and think that life will never get better, Discover is the place for you. There is ZERO job advancement opportunity. It amazed me the number of people that had worked there since the eighties that are still doing the exact same thing they started. The benefits are the big thing they will try and play up, they really aren't very good, nor do they make up for the way which the company and its deadbeat customers treat you."
bad,If you want to talk to over 100 people per day this is the place for you. Customers call to argue with you about why they have incurred 50 cents in interest charges. If you like being micro managed and told all about what you’re doing wrong then this place is for you. Hours are horrible and good luck finding someone to answer your questions after 4pm
bad,"The days I do work are full of anxiety, stress and tears. The customers are rude, the training is rushed and the trainers do not seem to care to answer questions."
bad,"This company is a complete joke. Too much office politics,just terrible all around. "
bad,Upper management had lost touch with the agents. There are a lot of unrealistic goals set. There is no work life balance. Expect to work 3 to 4 weekends in a row. Not much room for advancement unless you know someone in another department.  There is a lot of favoritism.
bad,"Really not much to say"
bad,Misinformation from the start.. Recruters mislead you. Your not collecting or even actually talking to customers for sometimes up to 8 months. They start you in a role they call mining. Ridiculous. Train you to get Right Party contacts then leave messages all day. When you finally get to take collections calls they rush  training. No real prep.  The training gets worse as you move up..I'm just glad I had previous collections experience.
bad,I can’t even begin to describe how horribly they treated me after being there for 7 years. I was bullied into leaving. It was awful and I had to take a LOA.
bad,"Working as an account manager in the fraud department at Discover (“charge verification group” as they call it) was a nightmare. First off, pay was lower than the competition, and while benefits were decent (pto, health insurance and 401K), at the end of the day, you weren’t paid enough to rise above the poverty line. Nepotism and cronyism are rampant and you’ll often see new hires that “mysteriously” breeze through the promotion process by quickly and undeservedly moving up without having actually achieved anything (other than being well-connected). "
bad,"Discover is extremely hard on their Employee's. They monitor all employee calls and have very hard criteria that you have to meet. They do everything to take away your Bonus by rating you low on calls. If you voice your opinion, that is the end of your job. Discover does not value the employee. I saw high turnover in the dept I was in.  They also discriminate on who they write up."
bad,The hardest part of this job was interpreting directives. Managers will often misguide teams due to lack of communication and training. As a result the work environment was ofter negatively charged and confusion filled.
bad,"Collections is a touch job. They do a decent job of trying to keep it tolerable, but I think most people treat it as a temporary job until they find something else."
bad,I had health issues like seizures and they told me that I couldn't be having seizures at work and that I could either quite or they would fire me.  Very poor quality of procedures towards those who have disabilities.
bad,The days are seriously long and management has absolutely no respect for the Administrative (Non Exempt) staff. The Non Exempt staff is excluded from the bonus pool and not taken serious when they apply for Exempt positions within the company.
bad,"Very high turnover"
bad,"Department full of amateurs and unprofessional working staff. The ""discover way"" is that of a company that doesn't understand risk factors and if you try and educate them, they can't handle that and will make sure to an outcast."
bad,"Management took massive million dollar bonuses then announced huge layoffs not long after.  Many of those involved still run the company to this day.  Hours were always long for most employees and the only thanks we ever had was a layoff based on our individual costs to the company, not performance."
bad,Discover was not a good place to work  I had one week of training and got thrown on the phones  you are in a group chat on your computer for questions and half the time nobody answers so you guess and if you guess wrong you get in trouble for it
bad,"Discover is the worst banking job I have had out of five Compliance jobs. The management is unorganized, indecisive, and unprofessional. "
bad,"Management was horrible. They made promises during the interview process but never kept their word. HR hires according to your education and experience. Trainers were very knowledgeable and helpful but once on the floor,  managers and team leaders treat you like second class citizens. Financial incentives were promised when you recieved excellent call ratings but never received. Instead we got t-shirts and mugs."
bad,"Discover is run much like Jr. High School. If your not part of the in crowd then your not going to go any where within the company. They promote who they want for what reasons they want and none of those reasons adhere to any form logical reasoning. When a company will promote individual who have only been with the organization a couple years and no education and not experience in that job function over another candidate with multiple year of experience in the job function and an advanced college degree with almost 20 year with the company, there's a problem. And when you ask for feedback they can't give you any if seems to me that they're discriminating but not wanting to actually say that they are so they don't incriminate themselves. That is what you'll find at Discover. It's really not a good place to grow a career. If your a hard worker and get a performance evaluations and earn your education, it probably isn't the place for you. I had an MBA and my manager and their manager only had a HS diploma and less experience. The only think going for Discover is their benefits are better then average."
bad,"Been working here for over a year. Was told not to worry about job security upon hiring - after 1 year - we’re being told layoffs are coming but they don’t know when. Management is sneaky and shady. They make up lies constantly about employees they dislike. Personal vandettas and retaliatory actions are rampant by management and they will target you constantly, make up lies about you, put you on unjustified action plans if they don’t like you. Managers are phony and act like they will support you but will bad mouth you to everyone they know. Contacting HR about this behavior is useless as they side with management even with evidence management is making up lies about you.  HR is not there for the employees- they exist to support the lies  their friends in the groups they support. Complete conflict of interest. I’m waiting for the meeting with our group to see who they will be laying off."
bad,The new management is horrible and only listens to the TL/Coaches when there is an issue. They are very loud and rude while you are on he phone and you are trying to hold a conversation with customers to help them with best solution.
bad,"There always seems to be a ""we're working on it"" mentality and excuse in Home Equity Loans.  They seem to blame old sr leaders, as a scapegoat to deflect blame.  "
bad,My supervisor was completely arrogant. I loved this job but did not like my boss. He was trying to get rid of me from the beginning. i would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,This is a flex this is a flex part-time position you will never get 40 hours a week very rarely ever get two days off together and your highest raise if you get one will probably be around $0.15 or less you don't get paid for things that you know experience doesn't matter I would recommend keeping your options open. People that work there are very nice. There is a very high turnover rate.
bad,I worked here for over a year and when I got my new boss our team was not good. When he was in a bad mood he would take it out on his employees. He was not someone I could talk to or trust as a boss.
bad,"Not good work environment, management promises you the world only to break their word, do not recommend this company to even my worst enemy"
bad,"A typical day consisted of arriving, clocking in and spending hours in the phone with not many breaks, and having to up sale when you were not in a sales position. I learned to handle upset customers. Management was horrible I had a miscarriage in the bathroom and was told I couldn't leave work, and then I was told I couldn't go to a family members funeral so I quite. My co-workers were the best they made the job worth it and I am still friends with some of them now. The hardest part of the job was being forced to up sale when you were not in sales and being told if you did not you would get fired. The only good part of the job were the people I worked with."
bad,The place is great if you like a prison.  Lots of security.  Lots of job firings.  No long term benefits.  You only can work there for a few months then they fire you.  Unfriendly place.  Has OK food.
bad,"Some areas are good, others, not so good.  Do your due diligence and ask lots of questions about the area, not just the company culture.  There are serious culture issues in certain parts of the company."
bad,This job was hard for many different reasons but mainly because you are on the phones dealing with mostly rude/angry customers. The managers try to make the atmosphere fun with spirit weeks and the company has a carnival once a year. But your job is to talk on the phones and some days you can take up to 45-50 calls. The work life balance was horrendous and the hours were just as bad 3pm to 11:30 pm.
bad,The banking side Is not growing at the pace needed to keep up with competitors. The company was not able to keep trainers during the course of training and on-going training was not relevant to the job role. This might be a great company for someone who has nothing else to compare it to.
bad,Discover provides all information you would want to hear when being hired but does not live up to its promises within the work place. They are unable to work with your life and help balance it out with your home life. They aren’t very understanding of what could go on at home.
bad,"The senior leadership management team was very cut throat and click-ish.  If they did not like you, they would go out of their way to create a hostile work environment.  They would do things to sabotage your reputation and work."
bad,Strange culture.  the team I was with did not understand their business and likened themselves to a software company which wasnt a bad analogy however they reasons they are not like a SW company were extremely important and not to be ignored.  they thing managing their business is a end/goal.  The team does not seem to understand its a means to an end.
bad,if youd like to work for a company that splits hairs then this is your place to go . i worked for discover for three years and the first two years were amazing . now that they won JD Power its no longer about the employees. its about making their ego bigger . so they forgot about the small wins you have and be the first to jump your case the minute you make one small mistake . EVERYTHING seemed to be a error even when it wasnt before in the past. Quality and Management are NOT calibrated on how to audit . Discover really went into a rat hole of a place to work
bad,"If I had the choice to go back here, I wouldn't. Not only is it hard to work in collections because you can get some really hostile people on the phone, but managment is very poor there. They don't take the time out to get to know all the employee's because there are so many, and just to get off the phones to go to the restroom you have to request. It was also near impossible getting days off and on holiday's when we called to request their bill money, a lot of customers would tell me how they can't afford to pay anything but I would get in trouble if I felt for them rather than keep finding solutions to get the money for their bill. I use my feelings too much so this just wasn't a good job for me."
bad,"On mondays Discover would do an Orange out Monday to acknowledge us employees. Granted they were the cheapest thing you can find at the store. The coachings and one on ones were pointless, no help whatsoever, i got more insight from coworkers than my actual bosses."
bad,"Horribly biased management team . . . from the top all the way through to the bottom. Political discussions were encouraged, as long as they were slanted in the direction management preferred, and if not, this was a way to identify those who would not continue with the firm. Fake news blasted on televisions all around the buildings . . . it was indoctrination at the worst level."
bad,Overall good company worked for 26 yrs with them. But there is no consideration for loyalty and commitment to the company you are forced out to make room for new less experienced candidate's.
bad,The job is very informative yet stressful changes happen everyday which is normal yet your expected to literally consume your life to their needs. If you are not a person who enjoys talking on the phone and portraying a role through every call its not the best occupation.
bad,"Was offered the job, did my onboarding, I9, drug test and picture for my ID. A week later I got a letter in the mail qualifying me for Jury Duty during a short time period of my first month of training. Called them to let them know, just to be nice and warn them. And a week later, they called and told me since the dates would interfere with my training they withdrew my offer. The law couldn’t save me because my background check was still pending so I wasn’t hired completely. If they couldn’t even work around me possibly being summoned for jury duty, what else can’t they work around? I was SO excited to start, I had already put my notice in with my other job and got my hopes up for an amazing company that my friends and family who work there have told me nothing but great things about. They told me to reapply after my jury duty. How kind of them. How about a hard NO. Thanks but no thanks. So if you randomly get selected to be a juror, don’t tell them until pretty much the day of so they can’t retaliate against you!"
bad,"call volumes are way to high and no one cares, you have sometimes hours stuck on back to back phone calls and it hurts you i you get stuck on a call during your break, or have to use the restroom over all great pay horrible work environment"
bad,"If you like to be babysat at work, this is the place for you!"
bad,I was hired for one position and once I started they completed a bait and switch. They kept saying it was temporary bc they needed help on the floor with never ending calls. They would get on you for taking a break from answer back to back calls and remember I never signed up for that. The whole time they know that the position they hired me and a group of 20 people would never enter smh. So they tried to place us in other departments that might make us happy
bad,I liked working here at first but the longer I was there I started to notice issues with management and a lot of inappropriate things happening. A manager even kissed me in the middle of my shift! It was very uncomfortable and it was while I was on a call with a customer. I did not have a good experience near the end of my employment with this company.
bad,You won’t get anywhere unless you are the favorite. You will always be told what you’re doing wrong. They knit pick everything you do. Always finds loopholes as to not provide benefits.
bad,"Great people to work with, flexible shifts to work day or night."
bad,"It's not for everybody, if you like the call center job, then it's a job for you but if not, then I wouldn't recommend working here. They get you with trinkets, free lunches, and little events. They say they care about the employees but what company really does? Great benefits and great pay but if you don't have a knack for the call center vibe then don't apply there. To advance would require more phone time and if you're someone who really don't like being on the phones, then the opportunity to advance is out of the question. Call centers aren't for everyone."
bad,I hate it. I dread going into that building every single day! Being on the phones is the worse part of my day! They want you to be robots where it seems like that goals and incentives are impossible to achieve. The customers are the worst! I hope to never see you people that call there on the streets! The customers talk to you any kind of way and you're supposed to accept it. They track you on the phones all day. So if you bust your behind to get the incentive and your phone is not good they take your bonus away!!! So if you have an emergency God forbid it happens at Discover because they will snatch your bonus away. Every I feel like less of a person when I walk out the building. Also THEY LIE EVERY STEP OF THE WAY! By omission of course. They bait and switch until you're stuck there. The only people who like their jobs are the ones who are NOT on the phone. By the look of things is seems like advancement is hard!
bad,"Horrible management, horrible environment, and unfair pay. Only thing good about them was their benefits. Don't understand why Indeed is forcing me to write a review on them, when my silence would've benefited them more."
bad,"Taking calls from customers via their credit card information and assisting them with any other needs. I used my communication skills, and my computer skills."
bad,This is a difficult place to work since management is constantly changing their minds. It is good for job people at the lower salary range but for more experienced professionals is not a very safe environment
bad,"The CEO stepped down and we received a new one. A lot"
bad,"A typical day at work would be accepting inbound calls from customers asking questions about they're credit card bill including card replacement, verifying charges and rewards."
bad,I am excited about the  position and the ability to help your company succeed. I would appreciate the opportunity
bad,There is no upward mobility in the organization. Most positions are horizontal promotions and not vertical. You have to kiss up to get a bit of a move forward. Just not worth it. Their competitive pay was not competitive at all. They sorely undercut pay and justified that their pay was not bad because of all the benefits you get.
bad,Work/Life balance was extremely unbalanced and management did not support their good employees.  Favoritism seen constantly which is a shame when there were a lot of individuals putting in a ton of energy and love in their work product without the same praise and support.
bad,"Managers are just time nuts that get paid more. You are constantly criticized and tracked. There was a time when my manager told me to ""not take so many bathroom breaks"". However, for some this is a great job, just not me"
bad,"Learned a lot of new things and few new tools. "
bad,They are not easy to maintain basically making it a battle royale in the department. Now I didn't do half bad but when quality starts to pick your calls apart ... they are very picky ... management apparently has your back( I do have to admit my first manager was amazing but even her hands were tied on things)
bad,There is not much room for advancement. Workplace is typical corporate cut throat. Management look out for themselves and will only help you advance if it benefits them.
bad,"Worked 3 years 6 months @ Discover contributing so many hours towards the hard work but did't get any proper recognization. Very poor management overall. Higher management don't respect your vision, suggestion and/or opinion."
bad,It took a month to even be interviewed and another month to start work because they hire in bulk. They have a 6 week training process and then throw you out on the floor. If you want to go on any vacations... better find a new job. I told Discover I needed certain days off for a vacation at my interview and they said it would be completely fine. As I finished training and got my own supervisor I told them the same thing and was told that would be completely fine as well. A week before my vacation they told me I was unable to leave. If I wanted to go I would need to quit and be rehired if i still wanted to work their. No thanks.
bad,"Advancement is based on favoritism and Management never really help. You can always rely on the those teachers in training, but once you leave the management doesn't really help."
bad,They talk a really good game in training. I mean those guys are the best and that’s why they do training. They set the bar high and when your training is over and you hit the floor doing your job. You will find out very quickly that it’s nothing like what the talked about in training. It’s very hard to get your shift covered and the trade board is pretty useless. It’s very difficult to change your schedule and it’s easy to get written up.
bad,"Overall, It was good but there were some heavy days where calls would exceed and it was back to back customers which didn't add up to the pay. The job isn't difficult, but there's lack of stability among management. The time I was there we received a new manager every 2-3 weeks. The ability to advance into other opportunities is difficult. Even with great customer service or being amazing at your job, promotion is far out."
bad,I wouldn't recommend working at Discover. They moved me across the country and stranded me here in Chicago when they restructured. I asked for them to help me move back home but they wouldn't.
bad,This is a good place to start to learn about how a call center works and learn great skills to move forward. This employer is a good place to build skills and move up or into positions that will compensate you better.
bad,There is nearly no opportunity to develop or advance without relocating to Illinois. The turnover rate is extremely high due to this issue.
bad,The work life at Stanley Steemer was not a good one. You would be required to show up at 7am each morning and most days would not be getting home til 9 or 10 at night. Was almost impossible to get a day off for family functions or appointments without being reprimanded.
bad,"I would rather light myself on fire than to ever work in collections again. Collections is a joke. They change the procedures literally every day. You are expected to remember all these ""law and compliance"" rules and they change them so often that nobody ever knows whats going on. Call quality fails your calls for things you didnt even know about. Then your manager would try to fight the failed calls for you but they were rarely overturned... The problem with failing call quality is it would affect your commission. I constantly felt defeated, and the coaches and managers would literally walk the call center floor shouting things into your head to do better, answer the call faster, remember this remember that, focus on this focus on that, so on top of people walking around like slave drivers screaming you had card members screaming too cause they were mad about being delinquent. It was awful. They have an onsite gym that costs 20 bucks a month to use and the hours of operation for the gym do not fit in with work schedules. The food in the cafeteria is WAY over priced. The only good thing about this place was making such good friends with co-workers and *some* managers. People who could relate to how awful it is to work there was nice. Nobody gets how bad collections is unless you work in it. They claim they have great benefits ummmm ya they are good but they cost a billion dollars, after taxes and insurance 3/4 of my check was gone. The only way to make money was to earn the commission but they made it near impossible to hit all the requirements to actually make a decent sized"
bad,This is a great place to be if you don't care about what you do to make a minimal wage or if you are just interested in insurance benefits.
bad,"I am a past employee of Discover Financial Services, and I just wish they would find a more humane, nicer way to let people know when attrition is going to end their job. "
bad,"tough place to work if your not a people person, get used to getting cussed at if you want to work here"
bad,"Agents are constantly going in and out due to the fact that they don't care about you as a person. It doesn't matter what ability you have, unless you're willing to be there 24/7, then you're not valuable. You WILL GET BURNED OUT IN CUSTOMER SERVICE. I took between 200-300 calls and I was never give a perfect score in a month. It would always be off by like one thing like, ""you didn't acknowledge the customer having to do (blank)."" It's a great way to get customer service skills, but don't expect to walk in and not get burned out in general CS."
bad,"Discover puts up a facade that they are a young, hip, accepting company. Within the first week, you could tell things weren't as they seemed. Discover pulls you in with decent hourly pay as an entry level employee, good benefits & a ""fun"" working environment but the truth is that you can never take proper breaks, management is against you & you may be consistently harassed by your co-workers with no repercussions from HR (even though its been reported numerous times by numerous people). In fact, it seems like harassing others is how you get promoted. I guess you could say they tend to hire from within."
bad,"Working in Discover Personal Loans was completely different from what I had been lead to believe about this company.  I had been told this company had a great culture and liked to promote within."
bad,"Working at Discover was emotionally taxing with the type of clients you service.  Most of the time when people are calling in to their credit card company, they are angry about something so you deal with escalated customers daily.  The only reason I would recommend this job is for something that just needs something to get by.  There is not a lot of room for advancement and the pay is not worth the stress you endure on a day to day basis."
bad,Was a contractor working at Discovery.  Worked endless OT with no perks except a flexible schedule.  Because we were contractors we were not able to use the gym or participate in any team or company activities like picnics or rallys.
bad,As Discover has grown it has eroded one of the values it feels it important.  Work-life balance.  As they have grown the managers are technical but have a poor understanding of managing people.
bad,"Great as a starting job.  They only promote from within and if they like you.  Management is a joke bunch, of unintelligent monkeys micromanaging people like kids.  Go to AMEX you'll get paid the way you should."
bad,"Discover company culture is one where any professional would love to be a part of. Fun, games, food and a friendly environment. "
bad,"Discover is a great company to work for if you are considered a favorite among the higher ups, if you are not considered a favorite it is an awful working experience. Upper management clearly plays favoritism and doesn't even try to hide it. They think if they butter you up with free food and stuff that its excuse enough to treat you like dirt. And all they talk about is how there is so much room for promotions and moving up in the company that's a lie unless you are a favorite once again."
bad,My job was to call people and collect on past due accounts.  Modifying information and updating information that was pertinent to the accounts.  There is a expectation to advance up the levels or you are let go if you don't meet your money levels of collections.  There is much data entry.
bad,"Employee culture is superficial and forced at best, you are only a number here and easily disposed of. I did learn things that I was able to carry on to my new job but that is the most positive thing I can say about this corporate machine."
bad,"Lots of management movement, restructuring and instability.   Heavily matrixed and at times felt like too many people stepping over each other to prove themselves. Managers I worked with were sometimes passive/aggressive (though not all).  Just not the place for me overall."
bad,"Discover is a typical call center environment working place with poor pay. Benefits are great! People are a bit weird and unhappy with their job. Not in general, but the majority."
bad,"laptops are assigned, but agents aren't allowed to work from home. They are only to be used when (for whatever reason), we aren't allowed to come into office--state driving ban, for example. Shift times can change at will on any weekend days. Holiday pay isn't given, instead a floater is assigned (i.e.: don't get to pick the day)."
bad,"I have worked at Discover for over a decade.  Management is never on the same page about policies.  There is very little margin for error.  They are quick to railroad tenured employees into being so stressed that they quit or get fired.  We never know what we can do to get a bonus, because no one can explain how the stats are calculated.  The system that does the stats is almost never correct.  Very hard to work in this type of environment.  It was not this way earlier in my career."
bad,The management is based strictly around sales numbers and offers for different products which is not really explained until after hiring. Customer Service is really Sales.
bad,Managers are in it for themselves.  They will lie to make them look good.   They will take your work and present it as their own to get promoted to a role in headquarters.
bad,To stressful for the pay. They pay good but not enough for the stress. Skip this employer. They pretend to care but they don't and the TL's are young and inexperienced.
bad,When I had two deaths in my family in one month I missed my goal  by less the 1% they didn't care after 5 years as a loyal employee.  I worked the hours no one else wanted and every weekend  Management is uninformed and no consistency in answers. The you get a defect for using the wrong info given by management  . MANAGEMENT IS QUICK TO THROW EMPLOYEES UNDER THE BUS TO COVER THEIR MISTAKES.
bad,"Every day you came to work, you walk in 10 to 15 mins unpaid start up the computer or you have to find a desk to work in. you have coaches and team leaders that say they care and want the best for you but honestly don't care they rather to the minimum and ignore you.  if you have questions, they will not be answered."
bad,"I learned OFAC Name Screening rules. It was not very challenging, no variety, compared to other jobs I had. The pay was decent for the limited responsibilities"
bad,Stressful this was very stressful in cma. Very cutthroat and unwilling to help you profess if not willing to do what they want you to. Have to go nights to promote
bad,Terrible place to work.  They micro manage and overwork you.  continually cut pay and bonuses all while making record profits.  Loyalty means nothing to this company.
bad,"The Scheduling and hours were great. the pay and benefits were decent but i did not feel like the training or management was good."
bad,"The place is great but the atmosphere feels like cliques and at times if you don't fit in with certain groups, employees will make you feel like the odd person out. They do not bend even if you have doctors notes for being I'll or you have children you will be talked to and even let go as the company has strict attendance policy."
bad,There is no set process for advancement at discover. Advancement there in certain departments seems to be based on favoritism. There also seems to be a lack of concern for the personal lives of their employees as they have made unannounced schedule changes which had not been agreed upon when hired. The benefits of working for Discover did not equal the amount of frustration and stress the company provided daily.
bad,Leadership is not held accountable for bad behavior. HR is not supportive when leaders misbehave. The politics are terrible at the Director and VP level.
bad,"It is your standard call center job, and don't let anyone fool you into thinking otherwise. Taking call after call, can be emotionally draining, and it's not for everyone. If that kind of environment doesn't bother you, then you would probably enjoy working for Discover. Overall the people I worked with were kind, and helpful."
bad,It is a misleading company in the sense that they hook you saying youll make full time quickly and then yank that away the second you step foot in the door.
bad,"As an Implementations Manager, a typical work day begins at 2am. You are expected to make changes to the database and network during non-productive work hours. This is typically when the least amount of debit/credit card transactions take place. There isn't much training on how to do this, but thankfully, your coworkers are very understanding and lend assistance if needed. Not the best work environment, but the pay and benefits are excellent."
bad,"Everyday the primary goal was to please the customer regardless of the abuse the card members inflicted on the account managers. The managers and human resources discriminated on my disability, which ultimately lead to my termination."
bad,"I liked working for Discover Card, the management was not very interactive with you and when they were they were very cold and not supportive if something out of your control were to happen. I enjoyed speaking to the card members and building the value of the business. My co-workers were great, they were always very helpful and I was able to build some great relationships with a lot of them."
bad,The pay rate for Collections was lower than the average. We didn't have set schedules although we were told we would. they over-hired therefore laying off within 1 year of starting the position.
bad,"investigate Discover Card Fraud, work 100's of accounts in que, inbound calls regarding inquiries about their fraud account.Outbound calls interview and follow up on suspects and any additional information regarding claim. Utilize Orion, Fiat, Fast Data, Soft pro and webtop applications as a tool for investigating fraud activity, addition intell and signature comparisons.Maintain partnerships with peers as well as management. Heavy emphasis on quality of customer service."
bad,"The operations centers at Discover Financial Services are really geared for the housewife looking for a job close to home, or the recent college grad who is looking for job experience. It's not for someone looking for career advancement in a professional position in the long term. Middle and upper management have been there since the beginning of time and therein lies the problem: they're indifferent to the professional needs of their subordinates and are only looking out for their own self-interest."
bad,"only accepts discover card so bring cash! gym , good training and nice facitlities"
bad,Estuvo bien los primero anos pero luego la sede cerro.
bad,The PULSE Business Technology division is becoming more and more about politics and not about technical execution and production. The business partners don't allow the technologist to do their job in assessing and implementing the correct solutions.
bad,My direct supervisors gave me so much trouble and I hated coming to work every day. I had an incident where an assistant manager yelled in my face in fromt of my co workers then there was no consequence.
bad,I got fired for missing too many days. I missed because I got into a car accident. I had a ptsd issue and they sent me home and counted it as another absence against me.
bad,"It was a very fast paced environment and it was stressful to take the calls that came in. We didn't really get our own desk either so you had to try and find an available desk everyday. "
bad,"It's sad when everyone under a pay grade 48 gets 2 extra raises in less than 2 years and now those who have been with the company less than 5 years make almost as much as someone who has been here 15 or 20 years or more. The rest of us should have got something which is why a cost of living raise, a huge one would be nice. Discover use to be a great place to work but it's gone down hill but I can't afford to quit right now. Some people think it's a great place and maybe it is for them but when you get treated like a pre-schooler and your job is threatened for no reason there's a problem. If you so choose to work for Discover, best of luck to you!!!"
bad,"Very misleading from the start. Your shift varies/changes so frequently, it is hard to have a life or plan ahead for anything outside of work. I started in a hiring class of about 30 people, and I believe 6 of my original hire class is still working there after only a year. Management is very gossipy and not very understanding. There is always a threat of being fired over any little mistake you make. Overall stressful and unrewarding."
bad,"The pay is great, I truly enjoyed working there. I was able to make several hundreds of extra money from their incentive programs but I unfortunately was fired after a family emergency took me out for a few days. No one was sympathetic. But I recommend anyone to apply, the job is easy once you learn the systems and terms."
bad,I personally didn't enjoy working for Discover after training. The management I was placed with didn't seem to care about my goals or the fact that I wanted to move up in the company.
bad,the worst working environment. the place is filled with lazy depressed people and management treats employees like children. you earn stupid trinkets as rewards for hard work.
bad,"Discover offers great entry level work. However, trying to advance significantly within the company is challenging. I was able to gain valuable usable experience while working for Discover Financial."
bad,"Limited breaks, micro managed like a two year old and have no problem giving criticism in front of the entire group of people you will be working with. Staff will throw parties and hang balloons, but have no understanding of professional Ieadership. "
bad,"Handled 30-180 days delinquent accounts. I had my owned customers that were assigned to me so our customers knew they were heard and didn't need to repeat their stories. Once we were able to get a hold of a customer we would ask their situation and figure out the best program to put them on to help bring their accounts current. We had to offer Direct payments which means we had to place their bank information into our system and set it up to have their payments come out each month automatically. The hardest part was to get our customers set up to do the DPYs. A lot didn't want to set it up, they wanted the control."
bad,"Call center work with flexibility to create your own schedule if needed. Potential for good commission. As such, some employee ethics come into play when striving for that next level."
bad,"Projects and initiatives are poorly prioritized and change direction daily, influenced mostly by brand team and old school leaders, both with very little digital marketing knowledge. Inexperienced PMs are assigned to corp flagship projects which are inevitably poorly executed and put company at risk for regulatory scrutiny. Direct marketing SMEs are exiting quickly, many being easily poached by competition."
bad,great company to work for just poor management. I have learned about consumer lending. Dealing with angry customers is the hardest part of my whole job. Best part of job is helping customers acheive there financial goals
bad,"When writing your review, please consider the following guidelines:"
bad,"Too many expectations, not enough recognition. No room for advancement if you are not in the ""cool crowd."""
bad,Learned how to better assist customers with application process
bad,I worked for Discover Card for 4 years and it use to be a fun place to work until the economy took a dive. In the beginning it was fun to be at work I actually looked forward into going the atmosphere was fun and the company always had something fun going on rather it be company bbq or winning fun prizes and gifts and the extra income bonuses were awesome but all that changed once the economy started to fail everything went away they changed the rules totally which now turned a fun place to work into a boot camp the bbq's stopped the prizes stopped and eventually the bonuses stopped you are still able to get a bonus but now you have to work 3 times as harder now to get it and when you do work 3 times as hard its not as much as you would have gotten before. I got burned out really quick once they started changing the rules and in after 2 and a half years Discover turned into the best job I ever had to the worst job I ever had.
bad,Limited opportunity for advancement. Managing up is not particularly encouraged. Much of the policies and procedures are disorganized but that is improving.
bad,"Discover wants to be an innovative fin tech but is mired in a poor culture, employees who don’t strive for more, and poor management. Pay is great but it’s a trade off for bad culture."
bad,"While the pay is great, and the company does a lot to keep their employees happy, they fail at listening to employees and communicating with them properly. "
bad,I was a Team Leader at Discover for while. It started off outstanding. New management came in and tried changing way too much too fast. Drove productivity down and put too much stress on the employees.
bad,Never again will I give up my entire life for a place that couldnt even care for you after you're out of training. Even the trainer was awful and made a girl cry and threatened her job because she didnt romantically like him
bad,"The pros were the fringe benefits: a really nice gym, the location was good, and the pay was okay. Negatives were promoted based on length of service and not skill. The position offered and the position placed in were a bit of a bait and switch. A lot of new employees felt they were being tricked into it being a sales position, when they were hired for something else."
bad,"the pay was horrible compared to the stuff you heard on the phones, they pester you day in and day out about collecting money and you get dinged if you don't collect any money. eventually you will get fired if you don't collect enough from customers"
bad,"I dreaded going to work every morning. Discover packs four people into one small cubical, so you hear everybody's drama, smell what they are eating and it seemed that the younger staff couldn't go with out their phones a constant annoyance."
bad,"If you're not in the technology or leadership areas, this corporation doesn't understand much else, so the work is unfocused, the management is crippled or lost in the middle, and the workplace is constantly changing, offering no security or transparency. Loyal employees were the most enjoyable part of the job. Amazingly childish politics and the ever-present passive aggression was the worst. The company tries hard but it's lost itself."
bad,A typical day at work is taking back to back calls for 8 hours a day. Approx 130 calls a day. The hardest part of my day is being on the phones all day with no break in between calls. Overall I learned great customer service skills within these past 2 years.
bad,"Call Centers just suck in general."
bad,"Nice manager; not able to disseminate the facts.  Be prepared to give all of your free time to your work. Some lower-level managers use the ""friend card"" to gain sympathy to leave early and leave the work to their staff."
bad,The rules and regulations in place are ridiculous and processes are backwards.The only good thing about them and the way they get employees to torture themselves by staying are the benefits.
bad,"Direct manager has a few things to learn to become a leader. Working at other companies, this one doesn't give you the opportunities to grow and is more condescending than managers I'm use to."
bad,"Collections is hard to be in period. It is stressful as it is but Discover made it impossible to handle. They set unrealistic goals considering how many restrictions they put on what we were allowed to do and say during a collections call. They changed their rules EVER SINGLE DAY, and that is literally not an exaggeration. Then if you did mess up because there were so many new rules and changes to remember you would get written up, getting written up means your bonus money was cut. IT WAS RIDICULOUS."
bad,"The benefits package is great, pay not so much unless you know someone.  Getting things done is a chore and if you can get it done, expect to wait for weeks if not months.  Everything and everyone is segregated so figuring out who to engage for assistance is difficult.  If you like having a meeting to discuss when your next meeting will be this is the place for you."
bad,"Needs fresh blood on management side. Lack of proper training tailored to specific job roles and departments."
bad,"I first worked in Sales. That was hard to get rejected tons and have to offer tons of things people didn't want."
bad,not the best place to work . no career advancement if  you have a dgree
bad,Handle many incoming calls but very good work place. This can be hectic at times.
bad,Discover expects a lot from it's employees. Expectations continue to rise and rewards and earnings decline. I worked there for over six years and actually saw my income drop due to constant incentive changes. Easy to move laterally but not up in the company. Culture is one of micromanagement where management makes you feel like you're not doing enough although you're giving 100%.
bad,"They were good at the start and my entire team and I were hired on at the same time. All of us were the top of the digital servicing department and a few months in they started changing policies making them in the agents eyes as unfair and almost in punishment. My department would take phone calls and handle online messaging. They told us that there was going to be a high call volume throughout the month of March. I did not notice a difference. The only difference noticed were the changes being made by the department. They changed our platform we would use to message our customers at. At first it seemed like a better system with a few bugs. Until we were no longer able to receive messages at all leaving many customers unanswered when messaging online. This turned into high call volume, which in turn left them putting us on most of our shifts being all phones. Which was not a regular occurrence and 20% of our shift was the amount of time we were supposed to be averaging. But no with messaging not working they took to instead of fixing it, trying to get us agents to pick up the slack on phones. This meant taking away all opportunity for Overtime in messaging which was an option previously and was unlimited. The only OT available was in phones, and started implemnting the policy where you must call in to cancel OT 24 hours before. Last time I checked OT was optional. If you had scheduled OT and either not come in for it, or cancelled it late it would go as an unplanned occurrence and count against you with scheduling. We are only allowed 6 occurrences every 6 months and for OT"
bad,"Ok place to work. Takes a long time to move up or gain promotions. Development meetings only about once a week, if that. Company has a gym and cafeteria."
bad,"Your metrics are more important than any other skill you bring to the job.  And your metrics are an ever changing target.  Great benefits and you can move up quickly, but the further up the food chain the worse you are treated."
bad,"Contractors with many years of experience and graduate degrees are treated wth less respect than interns. Severely unorganized and very cliquey. Too reliant on outsourcing, making communication difficult. And I'm sure the fictional food at Litchfield prison is way better than the DFS cafeteria."
bad,"Overall they give the appearance of a fun and inviting place to work for and give the appearance of being family friendly.  Under the service you will only be able to excel if your young with no other obligations.  They give no leeway if you have a family and our not flexible with you schedule at all.  You have only a small number of days you can be off unplanned and anything else will get you terminated, even if you sick or not."
bad,"It's an average job in pretty much every way. It's not the worst job ever, but I also wouldn't reccommend it to anyone. Financial services firm, sister company to Discover Card."
bad,"I would come into work urgent cases where detail from merchant came in or payment would post from card member that needs to be done in a timely manner. I then work my new case for follow up to call the card members obtain any suspect information or do chargebacks to merchant. After all of my new case are opened I would follow up on case I am working to get ahold of card members for further information, police, suspects, or review detail or affidavit that have came in."
bad,Job wasn’t easy. Constantly trying to get people to pay bills they obviously can’t pay is repetitive. I know how it is to literally not be able to pay a bill and someone harassing me about it wouldn’t make me happy.
bad,I was not able to move up in the company due to inexperience even though the position I was applying for was entry level. Also was moved to a lower position right after first month on the floor due to low performance.
bad,"The position that I applied for was Customer Services Rep for customer who would be calling in to make payments and want to make any updates on their credit cards account. After training when we started on the team floor we were making called to high level billing customers, which was us leaving messages the entire shift. If we are not able to transfer the customer ( at least 5 a day ) to the payment agent we were coached. I was in collection department of high billing not customer Services..."
bad,There is little opportunity for advancement.  The Houston division tends not to promote from within. They look to the outside for applicants for new job openings.
bad,Discover does a lot of good things for the community. Discover needs to provide more trading for employees when they come back from a medical leave. Also have more group training and go over new changes.
bad,"Culture and people there are fantastic, even as high up as middle/senior management (director level). Some of the most caring and sincerely empathetic people I've worked with - I will give them that. However, the problem is that there are very few *true* upwards advancement opportunities to be had, unless you are bee-lining for a team coach/team lead route. "
bad,The overall benefits are great but its hard to get promoted. You have to kiss up to managers and managers don't do their jobs. They just stand around talking all day. This place is a joke
bad,"Discover offered plenty of monetary bonuses and treats, as well as constantly kept contests and events going on. However, the job was emotionally draining. Many calls came in and you couldn't do a single thing to help the cardmember but were trained to pretend to help people."
bad,"Calls after call after call"
bad,"Discover wasn't a terrible place to work, other then the back to back phone calls of r-tards not knowing a thing about credit and thinking they are entitled and have no idea how credit works, the fact Discover always has food and the people/employees are nice."
bad,"Dont get sick. If you miss more then two days they make you take a medical leave. What they don't tell you is you have to miss at least 7 days to qualify for said leave. "
bad,They are to hard on the collection process and rude to the customers. I felt that we were not working with the customers enough and would get hangs up and we called to many times in a day.
bad,"Discover offers great benefits"
bad,"Discover Financial Services used to be a great place to work. I used to love coming into work. Many of the employees would work hard and still find time to socialize with each other. We had many contests and free food. It was kind of like a big family, but I guess when Discover wasn’t booking as many accounts as they wanted to, they decided to change up on their employees."
bad,"To advance at Discover, you need to kiss up to your superiors and put down your subordinates.  You also need to talk behind your peers' backs to jockey youself ahead of the competion."
bad,nothing black and white with yhis company...........................................nothing alot of sketvhy stuff goes on with management taking advantage of employees
bad,"Everyone at Discover we’re incredible, I felt so welcome. Just like any job, you will have good days and bad days, but here I felt there were more bad days than good. The customers, themselves, don’t treat people right. Their CELT (the call review team) graded calls in such a poor way, and the customer surveys weren’t reflecting fairly either, a Card Member could grade me super low and add a comment saying the experience was good but their computer was acting up or but still I would have horrible numbers because it was not disputable."
bad,"I scheduled payed time off for two weeks and when I returned I come to find out that they were only paying me for 3 out 12 days that I was gone. This left me with an unbelievably small paycheck, I had no knowledge whatsoever that management gets to decide how many days you actually get payed throughout PTO until I contacted HR about the issue. That’s when they told me I was in the negatives with PTO hours and that they only saw me scheduled for 3 days of PTO rather than the 12 days, but when looking in the schedule it was approved for the 12 days, coaches knew I was taking the days off and didn’t even bother to tell me or warn me that I wasn’t going to get payed for the full amount. It’s unacceptable considering the upcoming bills I have, now I have to pull from savings and I believe this is ONE of most frustrating thing that has happened while working there"
bad,"All they care about is if you are taking phone calls or not. Period. You have a problem in life outside of work? That sucks. You are feeling overwhelmed? Walk it off for 15 minutes but make sure to clock out first. Have mental health issues? Have you tried to kill yourself? No? Then it's not THAT bad, right? Run out of PTO before the new year resets it? Oh boy, then that means you HAVE to come into work, no matter what might pop up."
bad,Making member payments and Balance transfers. Assisting member with any technical support issues they may have . applying members for Credit line increase.
bad,"most of the goals you are required to meet are, very difficult to say the least. Sales requirements are kind of hard to meet in this day in age especially for a credit card company. Sales has never been my strong point."
bad,A typical day was to call customers on automatic dialer. Try to collect payments on customers past due accounts.  up sell protection plans & persuade customers to make promises to pay their past due bills.
bad,Collections is a hard job to do. They give you a goal that you have to reach each month and you get in trouble if you don't reach it. But most of the time you get people that know who is calling and don't answer.
bad,"In the time i worked for this company for the most part was treated very well, and pay was descant however this company let go allot of people  that had worked for the company for a good period of time. For what reason not sure but that very next week there was a brand new person hired at less pay to replace then ???????????? in my eyes not the way you do business but that's just me ."
bad,"The rules and regs of your daily work are over the top, scripts to the T need I say more. I felt like a robot. For a call center position the pay left alot to be desired."
bad,It is a call center so expect to be on the phones. Unless higher qualified for non-phone job mental paitence is needed. They offer incentive but they have to many factors and stats. that affect how much if any you receive and also tax it heavily. Other than talking on the phones great environment to work in management and co-workers are all freindly.
good,"I didn’t enjoy the job itself, but the people were nice. Calling out to people who hasn’t used the card in a while was stressful 85% of people hang up which makes sales target hard but no impossible"
good,When I first started working at Discover they were a great company who cared about their workers and had a hold on work life balance. Recently upper senior management changed and the company went down hill. They have no care for their employees anymore and the stress level in office has increased. They took away an option to receive monthly incentive.
good,"Discover Financial Services was not assisting those employees during both in classroom training/learning were understanding and or comprehending at the highest spead this company placed upon all hired ""Risk Managers"""
good,"The company hires mostly young kids just graduating high school or college.  They offer low pay and a extreme micromanaging environment. They didn't know how to establish KPI's so we had a new violation on our reviews every month because they would add new items without notifying us in advance.  You have to read everything from scripts and they track every aspect of your job.  I believe if you had to ask for permission to use the restroom they would monitor your restroom time if they could get away with it.  "
good,Discover is Great at start i just feel like the advancement that is promised isn't given unless you are well known and hourly theyare not competitive so if you want to get the training using phones i recommend it  but all in all it has its Fun times like all Jobs as well and a Gym so i get my Work out on Daily
good,"If you don't want to kiss butt and be a yes man, not the place to work. I was there for 9 plus years, management in my area was hardly seen and it is a what have You done for me now menality."
good,I didn’t like working at discover. Some people have found it really fun place to work but it didn’t work for me. I like a hands on experience and more control over what I work.
good,"I left this company because the management was extremely poor. We were hired because we were either military, or a military spouse and we were given poor instructions on what we were supposed to do. No time off for a funeral, nor time to grieve for even a few minutes without nasty messages from the manager."
good,"not a professional work environment; constant distractions; employees playing games, talking loudly, throwing balls overhead, yelling & making noise and distracting you."
good,"some times it seemed like who you know not what you knew, focused on the younger crowd and not wanting to hurt their feelings instead of teaching the right and wrong way to do things and how to benefit from hard work"
good,I didn't hate my time there but I didn't enjoy it either. It is very political as far as advancement and career growth. It is a classic call center appearance and feel.
good,"enjoyed talking to customers, helping them with any problems with their account. winning contests against other co-workers. flexable hours was a plus, their programs for going back to school to advance your position in the company"
good,Company spent tons of money to come up with an open work environment that only makes it loud and hard to work.  Too many distractions.  Management has no clue what it really going on in the technology area.  Everyone is afraid for the VP to find out so there is all kinds of lies being told.  A couple people on each team do the work while the others do nothing.  Nothing is done about it.
good,Great place to work. No room for job growth. Too many cliques. Not an inclusive environment. Only certain people are granted advancement and growth opportunities. You are easily pigeonhole into job roles/position.
good,"I worked at Discover for several years. I was moved, involuntarily, to student loans. I went from a great team, and boss, to an unpleasant boss, and very unpleasant job. "
good,The call center was welcoming and fun. The professionalism was a missing piece at the location I was employed at. I did get a chance to work from home.
good,I was a contractor at Discover Financial Services and my experience was great. The manager was and atmosphere was great.
good,"This is mostly a call center, and those who are not looking to move within the company."
good,"Ok place to work. No growth, direction for non exempt personnel."
good,Senior management is very political and plays favorites. If you are not buddy buddy with them don't plan on a long career. The benefits are incredible though!
good,"When I started in ROCC it was a great job, however, when I got promoted to Customer Service. It went downhill. From there,  stayed a total of 8 months at the job & swore I would never go back to a call center job. I didn't feel they gave me the necessary tools for me to be great at my job. Only told me what my faults were & never really helped me."
good,"management was lacking, didnt tell you when you were in the red goal wise didnt help when needed."
good,"High-stress environment, trainers not available for retraining every word is recorded and picked apart, years on the job does not matter every four months you have a new manager my customer service experience and banking info I learned is transferable , the most enjoyable part was the 6 weeks of vacation time I earned over the last 18byears"
good,"Although this can be an extremely easy job, it gets very boring. Also, some of the managers do not have your best interest at heart. There was not a good work/life balance. They often didn't seem to care about your home life, just making money."
good,Opportunity to advance is rare and management does not have vision of daily business needs. I don't want to give this company a review as it does not deserve
good,If you like loud rap music blaring in the background while you try to be professional on a call than this is the place for you. If you don't suck up to management you will get no where. It's not about how good can you service your card members it's about who you know and that you are only driven to be a leader. If you can only service your customers through collections you will not succeed at this company.
good,"Typical day includes taking calls from members about their credit cards. They are very concerned about call scores and goals as a team being met. "
good,"The coworkers were the best part of working at DFS. In the department that I was placed in there was no steady management and no one was ever on the same page or up to date with compliance and policies and procedures. It was a very frustrating environment to work in, as well as compliance changes nearly wiping out our department entirely. I miss my peers and the bond I had with them, but the job itself was boring and slow paced, and often times we would run out of call at some points of the day."
good,* Lazy managers
good,Company is very orientated towards gay community. They really didn't like breeders. If you were not gay the prospect for growth at Discover is limited
good,"I sent many years here as a customer service rep and team leader.  The goals are tough, and with the cheating they allow, it is hard to get ahead doing the job how you are supposed to.  They are very strict and often fire employees.  People stay for the benefits and wage, but no one is happy here."
good,"Micromanagement and distrust.  Management treats employees with distrust, rude, bullish and passive aggressive mean behavior.  Management encourages a political office atmosphere of back stabbing, gossip, and apathy."
good,"I was promoted to an applicant specialist to a customer service representative. Once I was promoted, I had not communication with my management team or co workers do to high volumes. I did not like feeling like a number."
good,"Things may have changed, BUT when I was an employee there was a lot of ""down time"". Application queues would bottom out half way through the shift and analysts would then have to make ""Welcome"" calls. Basically harassing new customers with scripted information about card benefits, products and services that ""might"" appeal to them and offering to answer any questions they may have.  Many times all the analysts were pulled off the phones and stuffed into a tiny office. There they would be shamed by management. We were all forced to listen to taped calls and then hear heated and sometimes embarrassing critiques of how terrible the analyst handled the ""welcome"" call. Names were not concealed and peers watched in horror as their coworker was humiliated. This was neither informative nor team building. I was fortunate enough to never be in this category as I would have quit sooner. I received ""Best Customer Service Call"" by the VP's on a remote listening and taping session. This call was played over and over and over again with managers yelling ""why cant you be like (so and so). I was hated by peers. Today this would equivocate to a toxic work environment. I hope they changed their ways. They did like to shake things up. Managers were promoted from within, but from other areas of the company. My manager came from billing disputes. She had no knowledge of the job of a credit analyst. She came to us with questions, and actually told new hires not to ask her questions because she knew she wouldn't have a good answer and to find a peer on the floor."
good,"Decent benefits, fair working conditions.  More departments need to be switched to salary.  Not enough privacy within working space to be able to focus on job duties."
good,"My experience was not a pleasant one, the manager gossiped about all her employees very negatively. It was a hostile working environment. Some employees were nice but the management team had poor leadership."
good,"It was nice because of the employees. Personally, my management ruined the job itself for me. It could have been better, but I wasn't really coached or helped with a lot & even was made cry. The other team had a much better management & she was very helpful."
good,"Discover offers great benefits and pay, but when you perform well in a group, they will move you to another department even though you put your effort and worked hard in that environment and benefited the department. They will not keep you there, instead they will shove you into another department to ""help out"", and hire other people from outside to replace you. I liked this company, but they have horrible management and practices."
good,"Discover is always hiring because no one actually stays. It’s a Non stop on the phone all day long, Back to back calls , angry customers and stressful workplace. Fake customer service. Calls are recorded/scored and that’s how you earn your “bonus” It’s hard to improve on stats when calibrations are ALWAYS cancelled. Stats are for everyone to see. Managers are always on you, time off the phone is tracked, written down and turned in felt like I was in high school. I do not recommend discover to anyone who is looking for anything long term."
good,"I always enjoyed my peers, but I hated the environment.  It was a ""mean girls"" environment with management.  Promotions were based on a popularity contest and not the caliber of individual that fit to do the job.  There was so much politics involved in every decision that if you weren't like by one person or had one gaff, you were never able to overcome it because there was no consideration for improvement ever. You were always your worst mistake.  My last supervisor was a liar and pitted team members and other managers against he other.  He promised people things that weren't true and that the was unable to provide.  He did not keep anything confidential about other employees work files. He made going to work every day a freaking nightmare and I would never work there again if I had to work for him."
good,"The  Work Environment  is Okay and needs to improve both in terms of the  pay and careers advancement ."
good,receiving calls from account holders behind in payments and setting them up on a payment plan if available or just accepting a payment.  how to deal with very aggressive customers over the phone     al cultures were there   hardest part was trying to talk to upper management   most enjoyable was calming customers and leaving at the end of my shift
good,"It's a fun place to work, but very difficult to advance your career. If you aren't in with the upper management good luck getting any advances."
good,"At DFS the best are not promoted, those with the connections are, and it creates a negative environment.  The managers get confident in their position and begin to become lazy, counting on their effective employees to keep them afloat and then they refuse to recognize their employees work."
good,Call center environment. Dealing with the public. Always being rated by management in terms of Quality and Customer Care.
good,A typical work day was very intense and highly stressful. My co workers helped with making the day a little easier to tolerate. The most enjoyable part of the job was the compensation and the communication between the customer and myself. Management was very unorganized and unstable.
good,"The company as a whole wasn’t a bad one to work for, management was not the best- but you did have some diamonds in there that really made work fun. They’ve taken away compensation in ways, but slightly brought it back. The environment depended completely on your surroundings, and if your team was negative going to work was hard."
good,"Many, many, changes constantly going on making it difficult to actually become “at home” with the company. It was difficult to have trust being that information you were given eventually changed over time."
good,"The management made it hard to work there. there was a hard time making time or arrangements with switch shifts in "
good,"I worked for Discover Financial Services for a little under 9 years, and during that time there were many ups and downs as can be expected in any career with any company. There weren’t many chances for advancement during my time with the company though others advanced extremely quickly which showed me that the management team was less interested in hiring those with tenure and experience, and much more interested in promoting and hiring those who knew or were willing to “fake it till they made it”. All in all it wasn’t a bad company to work for if you are willing to settle for mediocrity and aren’t working for advancement."
good,Your work day is very regulated. Management only wants to promote them selves and doesn't care about individual success. Meeting happened everyday almost twice a day.
good,"I knew my job extremely well and had always received the highest rating on my yearly reviews.  After 25+ years, I learned multiple skills and was afforded the respect of my peers and all levels of management.  Discover as a whole, is a GREAT company to work for.  They have some of the best benefits that I've ever heard of and their PTO is very generous!  I can not say enough about how great of a company that Discover is.  Aside from the few bad apples, you won't want to leave if you get into the right area.  There are however, two areas that the company could use some work on.  1.  Higher pay for long term employees.  2. Although a college degree is a great asset, it shouldn't be the biggest requirement necessary for someone to move up in the company.  It actually says on their postings on Indeed, ""A degree of any type"".  There are people in Sr. Management that have Horticulture degrees and Fashion Design.  This is a financial company.   A person who wants to move up, has to either have a degree of some sort or agree to start school after you're promoted."
good,"Discover Card was a very competitive company in the industry.  However there were many instances of reduction in force.  This caused a lot of stress and tension in the work place. "
good,"Typical day consisted of taking phone calls with Discover credit card customers. You have to manage all of your stats (AHT, After Call, etc...) When I was there they just got rid of making people sell credit card products so you just had to offer on each call."
good,"Supervison was new to management. Was a spectacular trainer with white board skills I had never seen. New to directing a group, schedule a problem, no resolution.Had to resign"
good,working at discover you get the community feel you wish you always had. there are benefits for doing your job well. however; It was difficult to move up in the company. Very slow going. It was not very flexible for a work life balance and changing your schedule for such is nearly impossible.
good,This is a great company to start with but advancement is not as easy as suggested. The people are wonderful but not having all reps in the same center and lack of communication can be a hindrance.
good,"I believe that the company overall is fine; however, certain departments are very micromanaged and flexible schedule is not acceptable and wfh does not exist - if you want to keep your job."
good,"They expect you to give your whole life to them.  There have been days where I've been in the office past midnight.  It's a pretty brutal culture.  They're terrible at promoting from within, also."
good,The job at first look good but you slowly figure out that its a fast pace job and that there no mercy. its hard to keep up and you can get in trouble if you don't
good,"overall not a terrible place to work, but not ideal for me for long term. hours can vary depending on shift, and shift changes are hard to get. usually work 3 weekends a month"
good,"The environment is okay. The pay isn't great. Customer Service Representative is a stressful position no matter where you go, don't expect different here."
good,Working for Discover was not a bad job. I appreciated the benifits and employee appreciation they had. They also had a great cafe and gym that I used often. The parking was frustrating since it and the building was so large you had to use a large amount of your personal time to get from one place to the next. I was interested in being a trainer and set up some meetings with managers to get an idea of how I could reach that goal and was basically told that I it was not possible to attan. There was never a vibe that made me feel like this was a place that I would be coached and developed for anything more than I was at the moment.
good,Management always said they want you to move up in the company but never fulfilled their word when the opportunity came up. When you finally get to move up in the company they will teach you new skills but once again when the opportunity to use your skills they will put someone else instead.
good,Answering upwards of 150 calls a day. This job has taught me patience with customers as well as management.  I love the people I work with. The hardest part of the job is the inconsistencies and not being informed well of changes.  Being tethered to a phone all day and being penalized when you have to walk away is not really a job I love being at.  I love customers and I love working with different types of people.
good,Was told that I would never do cold calling and when I started that is what I did. It was a deal breaker for me to take the job and did not have compassion for personal issues that came up never followed through with what i was told would happen if i was not happey with a department
good,The management acted like they wanted to help but are really all about their numbers. They speak of room for advancement initially but advancement is mostly based on who you are friends with. It's a good reputable company but they need to make some changes.
good,"worked as a contractor, which was common due to short term work and high turnover (only 10 months). lots of process with little substance and loyalty was valued much higher than competency and work quality. management was nice but the only people who seemed to know what they were doing were the contractors. the culture was definitely anti-contractor, i couln't even pay extra to use the gym or the showers in the gym, nor could i utilize the downtown office or remote work. it was 27 miles away and at least 90 min driving each way."
good,"Second child was not covered by health insurance. Was not properly trained upon returning, fired because not up to par after returning. Loved the company but personally had a bad experience."
good,I have learned a lot from discover. I have learned how to better my customer service skills.  My co-workers are great.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to coach and help people on my team.
good,Discover is a okay job the compensation isn't very well or what they try to make it be. The balance between work and life is pretty UNBALANCED. But that just might be me.
good,Interesting working in call center environment.  Being micro managed was hard to get used to.  Co-workers were great.
good,"Learned more Microsoft skills."
good,"I did collections for Discover Card.  Automatic calling system, some inbound calls.  I enjoyed the people I worked with.  The job itself was difficult, most people didn't want to make their payments."
good,Ok to work for.  The Upper Management is ok the Human Resources Dept is great!
good,"Nice atmosphere when there are no job losses or severance package rumors. The management sucks and the upper management can't be bothered with any issues, the HR dept is a joke, they just tell you to go online with questions. I didn't work in customer service, but I rarely heard good things. Cafeteria food is overpriced and tasteless, systems are outdated, and no opps for advancement."
good,"The people are very friendly, the benefits are great, the company is very customer focused. However, they have lost a bit of common sense with regard to employee flexibility in the name of profits and investor/board sentiment."
good,Leadership is blinded by favoritism and there is no reality to the espoused meritocracy. Mediocrity prevails in a fear-based culture. New leadership may be trying to change things.
good,"I was working as a developer, but I was a ""Reporting Analyst"". They had morphed my role into developing internal web applications, but I was supposed to only pull reports using SQL."
good,"Great people. Great work environment. If working seasonal position plan on not getting sick at all or you will not have a job. I had a seasonal position and ended up getting bacterial bronchitis. I tried going into work but couldn't make it through the day without coughing terribly and a fever. Once I finally was better a week later I ended up with the 24-hour flu. "
good,As far as money this is a great place to work. Guaranteed raise every year amount just depends on work performance. Work and home life balance is horrible. Schedules are changed based on company needs so the schedule you get hired for may change. Forced to work three weekends out of the month with a monday- friday schedule. Management allowed to treat employees however they please with no consequences with no
good,"- My first trainer worked with me a lot. "
good,"I liked this job during the training but when we started moving to our team leaders, they were just so strict and the calls were back to back, you couldn't even use the bathroom without getting in trouble"
good,"When you work in the financial industry, there is already a wealth of things that cannot be said. When you work for a super conservative financial company such as DFS, they dictate exactly what is said with zero autonomy. In addition, you have to make sure youre back on the phone at the exact right time, regardless of how long the previous call ran over into your break, or the lack of adherence will cause you to lose your bonus."
good,"The only good thing was the pay at the time. The hours sucked and was not flexible given any situation. Management only cared about people they knew or liked, nobody else had a chance if there was a “manager favorite”."
good,Opportunity is constantly discussed but in order to advance at all many years of work are required to barely move up in position let alone pay. very disappointed in what  I was promsied as someone with a BA.
good,Discover had great benefits and a decent work environment. However I felt frustrated by the culture they had in which they essentially brainwash you into thinking you will never find a better job out there.
good,Cool if you're into that whole SJW thing I guess. Not for grown ups. Managers are very young and inexperienced and seem to be more focused on reliving high school than tackling the tasks at hand
good,I would recommend a job at Discover Card to others.  They are not very flexible with working schedule hours.  We were required  to work 3 Saturdays a month. This did not work with my schedule.
good,Force into fraud department due to company need. Not exactly happy about that decision and very strict schedule adherence required. Team leaders only concerned about numbers. Low starting pay compared to other call centers but immediate benefits given on first day of employment.
good,"While there are unlimited (for the most part) opportunities to advance within the company, the management is far from consistent. One week you could have a team leader, and the next you're being condensed into a new team, moved desks and with a new team leader that follows some regulations your previous team leader had not and vice versa. Most of the time the employees are great as well. But I couldn't help but feel a sense of a 'High School' environment."
good,I really wanted to enjoy this job.  The company worked very hard to keep the atmosphere fun and rewarding in order to make up for the very tedious work.  Phone call after phone call answering the same questions.  Abusive customers made the job that much more difficult. It also became very apparent after training that advancement was almost impossible.  New jobs very seldom became available.
good,Typical work day is very demanding. A person will learn a lot about the Credit Card business and how it is often changing. The employees are very helpful and everyone who works there is family because Discover hires people with similar qualities. Wonderful benefits just the lack of pay and movement throughout the company is problematic.
good,Worst account to work with!! Management is also worst and people at higher maangement is also bad. In human behaviour that's what i can say. people who are not highly talented couldn't able to survive too much.
good,took phone calls and assisted customers needs. I felt my sales skills were above and beyond my position at Discover. I went into the real state market and did very well.
good,The money is ok but management doesn't really care about you and they have a high turn over rate. Every other week they have a new team of reps coming in.
good,"Discover is lacking in strong leadership, i feel that promotions are based on personal relationships built outside of work and not based upon performance within the company."
good,"I loved my team and my training class and still have contact with them today, six years later. The work was not hard, though monotonous, and you can expect to get help when you need it. If Heather is one of your Team Leads, you'll be set! For the most part, you can set your own schedule and move things around. However, many of the team leads play favorites. For example, if you're not a chosen one and there is a scheduling conflict concerning your children, do not expect any sympathy. I was told to have ""a backup for my backup."" As in, have three sitters lined up if your kid gets sick, because when there is mandatory overtime or the favorites are already gone for the day, leaving to pick up your child will result in a write-up. If you are a favorite, you can violate dress code, hang out off the phones with the boss all day, and take a nap at your desk, blanket and all."
good,"Logged in phone system and computer systems, take inbound calls from customers. Fixed problems, reissue credit cards, all maintence of customers credit cards issues."
good,"coding programs, production suppor, issue resolution, escalation"
good,Good people but everything you do is looked at under a microscope the job just isn't for everyone
good,Take incoming calls for card members with questions. Utilize problem solving skills and demonstrate customer appreciation on every call.
good,"The company was not very flexible with work life balance.  Getting a new schedule proved to be over a year wait.  The morale of the company was very low.  Most were there just for the paycheck.  Typical call center job, schedule adherence is important and they push other producs"
good,"The Job is stressful and does not pay well, benefits are great, but its not worth the poor management "
good,"Benefits are great, management has no communication with employees."
good,The company has changed a lot in the past five years. People have become secondary.
good,Was not pleased. Was given a false answer in my interview. Then they had me do what the said that the company did not do. Said that the did not do telemarketing but only call customers that are expecting my call or they need some other form to continue with their loan application. But the in the down time would call other discover customers to see if the need a student loan. (that is telemarketing).
good,Discover is definitely a productive and fast paced environment. Discover does offer great benefits as well as a a good management team. There is definitely room to move up the ladder if you're up for the challenge.
good,It is a call center so it is face paced and can be noisy. The hardest part of being on the phones is the back to back calls. Managers can be over bearing at times.
good,"They are not flexible with your schedules. Makes you work pretty much every Saturday. No time for Family, no way to get requested time off when needed."
good,"It's an okay place to work, however, it's very VERY fast paced and can be quite stressful. I don't feel that the training was proper or adequate for the job (even with 10 weeks of it), and felt very unprepared to be thrown on the phones."
good,"The management is allowed to be extremely rude. Except for a few most are a bunch self obsessed, narcississtic, egoistic, rude skanks that behave as they wish and get away with it. Contractors are treated as second-class humans. They are not even given first-aid. The technical, functional teams are good though."
good,"Discover served me well for over 5 years. I loved the PTO package, health insurance was amazing, flexible schedules, and the 401K match is incredible. They have family activities, department recognition events, and a really nice cafeteria. I also contribute my skill set to the personal development classes I attended throughout the years there."
good,It was too much for me. My lead wasn’t the best fit for me. J would always see other teams have put locks and not once when I was in the specific team did we have one.
good,It was a great place to work until I was cheated out of extra bonus money earned at the end of the month twice. Managers were some what rude and could be unfair and down right nasty at times.
good,I enjoyed working here but the pay wasn't the best and I had a hard time providing for my family. Once I was scheduled for a raise it was only like a 25 cent raise. Not very ideal. I was on the early schedule too which was hard.
good,"I enjoyed the atmosphere and the people I worked with. The only way to enjoy this job though is to be on the good side of your manager. Otherwise, it is not the enjoyable."
good,The people and teams are great. I love working with the lower level people. But the management.....leaves a lot to be desired. They’re constantly changing things and not telling anyone until last minute.  For example currently I am waiting to find out if I have to move departments before the end of the month (it’s the 22nd) and they were supposed to tell us 4 days ago but say a decision hasn’t been made yet.  Also most upper management has no idea how to do the “lower level” people’s jobs.
good,"During my time at discover, i at first loved working there. Working in a call center can be very monotonous, but discover is constantly doing something to keep it entertaining. They enjoy giving snacks and other food to the employees regularly. They do organize events periodically, though they are disheartening mostly. The culture can be very brainwash-y. The company will claim they truly care about you and want to support you, but in fact they have predetermined responses depending on the emotion or concern you may be projecting, they refer to programs or guides which seem nice at first but offer no real assistance. If you cannot be an ecstatic ball of sunshine on the phone with every call - they are quick to let you know of your faults with little consideration for real conversation between two people as a truly human customer service rep should value. Moving up in the company is all about who you know and who can argue for you rather than the true value of the work you can do. As long as you meet your minimums - if you have the right people in your pocket then you will advance."
good,The culture was good but management was new and did not help with the department goals as they had no prior experience working in AML.  Made working there very difficult and long hrs up to 15 hrs a day.
good,"It was a decent company to work for, the job was okay but like any customer service related job you can get some nut cases calling in especially since you're dealing with their money/credit accounts. If you love talking to people and can deal with ticked off customers constantly then this is a job you can easily do and excel at. The company itself is pretty great, pay is a lot better than most call centers but their HR department seriously needs some improving."
good,Usual call center environment; could not accommodate a part time schedule for me. Their description of part time was 39 hours a week and I only wanted 20 to 25 per week.
good,"Too much emphasis on individual managers' competitive feats.  Not enough teamwork with primary focus on work goals. Promotions not based on skill, based on political clout."
good,"The environment was wonderful, the people were amazing. However you can't ever have any life stuff happen and you always work. You get promised promotions that never come, you work ridiculous hours with ridiculous stats/metrics to meet. I took well over 300 calls a day and would have consequences if I got ANY information wrong. My coach was terrible, my team leader was pretty great. You do get a great amount of time of PTO, but if you have any life events pop up after that or ANYTHING happens even with pto, you're guilted for using it and you're punished. This is coming from someone who worked there for 2+yrs. I absolutely loved the people and I did learn how to efficiently work in an office environment while learning to give excellent customer service, however it was a rough ride getting there. One of the trainers threatened my job on multiple occasions when I asked 'too many questions' and was going to school at night. Discover will be your life, your life gets molded around it."
good,"ever since i started working at discover it seems like its been a struggle. i started off as a contractor working part time and when my team had been offered permanent roles the company was unwilling to provide part time training( i was enrolled in college classes and worked my classes around what my work schedule was at the time) after jumping through hoops to communicate with anyone i finally was able to just attend new hire orientation and continue with my contractor duties as a permanent discover employee. a couple months in i learn my department is switching to iru. I honestly did not mind this because with it came a shift change that suited my schedule better and allowed me to be home before 10 pm. then out of no where we had to transition back to our previous duties, with that came another schedule change. things returned to normal and within a few months i was able to start working from home, which has been a god send with going to college. it has alleviated driving in rush hour traffic and has been very laid back. then most recently, my whole department got the news we were to be transferred to a completely different department. once again i had just started college classes and scheduled these classes around my work schedule. so i was terrified id lose my job and was even told by my tl that i should look for employment outside of discover if i couldnt make training. mind you this was only two days after i had just started school again for autumn semester. thankfully, three days later, i was told that if i cant make training i could just stay in my current department."
good,"The job is very stressful. Management is very inconsistent! Under paid, and unfair HR policies. Think wisely before applying for a position with Discover!"
good,"Change is one of the pillars discover thrives off of but I have yet to experience this, I haven’t had to personally change or adapt to anything at discover. Yes procedures change and rules may change but this happens everyday in the business world. Change needs to come from within the company and operations wise. Discover wants to remain conservative and stick to what works in the business"
good,Overall this isn’t a bad company to work for my only complaint was how hard it was to advance or how hard it was to get into a different department once you start. management was OK they really didn’t understand how hard it was to be on the phones 24 seven and relate to their employees but other than that the pay was good the benefits were good. Lotta great discounts .
good,Discover card financial services is a fast paced friendly environment which requires lots of work load. I used to take on average 300 to 400 calls per day.
good,"Good luck finding room for moving up. they never had any space for new management, always telling people ""soon"" but it didnt come soon enough. dont be fooled"
good,"It is a very stressful and competitive place, they always had games and treats to keep us from going crazy at times. But over all if you're competitive then it's for you."
good,they try to be fun but in the past year they unless you're in management you don't get to do many of their fun activities. Don't even get me started with the management team they have for payment verification.
good,"Is a good place to begin your employment, the hardest part of the job is that the company does not always pay you for going above your job role. Great benefits and great coworkers."
good,"Typical day- on the phone all day with back to back calls( can't even exhale)"
good,"this is a great starter company. this gave me the confidence to have corporate under my belt, but i would never work for them again. i enjoyed the position in the beginning."
good,The training program is fantastic and the trainers are engaged and helpful. Being a training manager in the past I am very critical of other companies training programs. This one was great. Once out of training and on the floor it changes a lot. The work environment is very loud and sometimes hard to hear the customer on the phone. There are no sick days to use and when I had the flu for a few days it counted against me. It was hard to balance work life and home life.
good,Made it difficult to have a life outside of work. They work well as a team and have fun ways to make work worth coming in. Lots of opportunities to advance your career.
good,"This was a good place to work. friendly people and teammates. training goes by fast depending on the department you are hired in. "
good,"I was a coach and on a specialty team most of my time at Discover Card.  On a typical day, I would take escalation calls that the floor could not complete and so it would be a one time question/answer so the customer could not have to keep getting transferred from one person to another.  I learned how to manage my time to get as much done as possible to assist the company.  I liked my coworkers, we got along well and worked as a team.  I enjoyed the people I worked with and our manager.  The hardest part of the job was, at times, the harder we worked as a team the more they found something wrong with the outcome."
good,"not enough employees"
good,Great place to work. Compensation and wages are low. Cafeteria and  Fitness center with landscapes to walk on sight. Leadership is awesome.
good,Work can be very monotonous and unfulfilling. The benefits are good if you can work there long enough to appreciate them.
good,"On a typical day of work you come in and jump right on the phone, and follow your schedule given to you that day. As far as management goes they were friendly but not very personable, they listened in on calls and corrected some of your calls. There was no down time so I didn't know my co workers very well but they all seemed nice. The work was pretty easy but not a challenge."
good,You're constantly on the phone if you're working for customer service for Discover card or Discover Bank.  There is a lot of pressure to keep your stats up and to sell the products that they offer.  I learned to hold my tongue and say yes and amen to everything they say.  The people that I met and worked with there are great but the management of the areas need some work.  The hardest part of the job was meeting the expectations that they have and that you had to be almost perfect.  The best part of the job was the paycheck.
good,I have worked for Discover Card for almost 2 years now. While working for this company I have had multiple positions to contribute to. While working for this company I have built a reputation in helping people through their daily financial struggles and helping them see the bigger picture. I can also say that I contribute to bring delinquent accounts back current with strong work ethics and negotiation tactics. My co-workers and managers provide me with the help I need to get though the day and compete with my peers on a competitive scale. The hardest thing I come across in my line of work is the long negotiation of working with difficult card members that don't want to pay on their delinquent accounts. I enjoy coming to work to be apart of a team that supports and helps each other through struggles. I've learned key social aspects to further me with any career path that I choose to go further with and pursue.
good,"I worked for discover for seven months in their ROCC department. Discover lied to me starting with the interview process. The interviewers and even the training team told me that I would be promoted within 3-6 months. When three months approached I ask my ""team leader"" if there was going to be a promotion in the near future. She told me not to worry that it would be coming soon. However, even at the six month point I still was not being promoted. The management there could not careless about you, all they care about is you hitting all your goals. This extremely upset me because I quit an actual paying job to start working at discover because I heard they were an excellent company to work for. Also, I was excelling in every way I had been top 5% of my department for three months so there was no reason I shouldn't have been offered being promoted to full time.  Working the 29 hours a week at 9.59$ an hour isn't enough to live on. At that point I was extremely upset because even when I would have gotten promoted I would only be making 11$ an hour. So, I quit and found a great job at American Express starting at 16$ an hour."
good,"SQL Server, recovery software, not utilizing my skillset."
good,"I liked the people the management, training was pretty good, but one thing is they let you be very casual then people take advantage and get in trouble for it but it starts feeling like a hang out sometimes. The pay wasn't very good for a collections job and the hours were completely exhausting. Even though you work nights your still required to be in at 4:45 on weekends. The hours just didn't leave a lot of time for normal things."
good,"Discover had a decent pay grade and benefits. Management was not the best, and was not flexible about working and going to school."
good,"Based on my experience working at Discover, it is considered as average badwork culture. Nothing great and nothing bad."
good,Not bad to work cafeteria and gym easy job good benefits overtime sometimes available most of the people working there are happy schedule subject to change
good,"Way too many Saturdays are required which takes away from family time and possible  vacation.  Not any actual sick time.  Just occurrences if you or family members are sick, who can plan for that."
good,"Everchanging environment. Must know someone higher up, in order to grow. Opprtunities are disguised, unless you are in a specific ""clique"". Upeer management VERY disconnected; sometimes they would not even look at you or speak, unless you are some hot young chica"
good,"Discover was a great place to work, I enjoyed the team aspect of discover and the training that was given as well. over all a great company to work for"
good,Don't plan on making a career out of it. Great place for young people to start out and learn customer service skills/ talking on the phone skills. It's not forever though.
good,"How they grade calls is a-little ridiculous, but the company themselves actually care for there employees and do a lot of activities and awards.  Good place to work."
good,"Everyone here wants you to succeed. They are definitely worker oriented, they give you a lot of free stuff. The job itself though is sometimes overwhelming."
good,I enjoyed working there because of the nice staff and location. Two things bothered me. The computers and all other technology was so old and behind. I didnt like the old technology used. They also don't give good raises or hire direct. They will hire temps first
good,A good place to work. A  good community partner with lots of volunteer activities.  Some flexibility if you request time away for various family activities
good,"This was a SHORT contract position. It was simply all about the work. The other contract people were great to work with however, the few full-time people we encountered were less than helpful. It was very difficult to complete our work due to their schedules."
good,Everything you do is controlled down to the second even you using the bathroom the pay is good but I wouldn't return to that company ever again.  Not worth it and the turnover speaks for itself
good,Discover is a good place to work.  Open seating.  Most roles allow up to some Work From Home.  Generous PTO.  Good health coverage.  Exciting industry.
good,"Work culture is very good. Everybody have flexibility for work,and put forward your opinion. They keep their technology updated.I enjoyed cafeteria lot. But they have car parking issue."
good,"n/a"
good,"My manager along with many other are micromanaging. The phone policy is ridiculous and it really depends on the time of day, cause every manager has different requirements. Though the food court is amazing and I cant wait for sushi to come back."
good,"It was okay.  It was a very bland, typical call center environment.  The pay wasn't great, but there were chances to earn extra income by meeting certain metrics.  I will say, my supervisors were amazing and extremely understanding.  They all started from the bottom and worked their way up."
good,It became very stressful due to the calls being back to back no matter the day and being stuck at the desk because of the headsets being attached to the computer. There were some department managers who caused a lot of drama with employees and were just plain rude for no reason. They do have good pay and good benefits .
good,"I excelled pretty quickly while working at Discover but learned after some time working in a call center can be extremely draining. The culture, people and management there were always welcoming and helpful. I went on a leave of absences and when I returned I was greeted by each person which made me feel much better about returning. Anytime I need assistance, work or personal related, someone was always there to help. But ultimately, even after being promoted, I realized the call center job was not meant for me. It was more of dealing with the being on the phones 24/7 & being treated like I wasn't a human by the people on the other end of the phone than it was anyone in the building with me. I did and do really like everyone at Discover but I think if you struggle at all with mental health call center positions might not be for you. I also didn't enjoy working the later shifts."
good,"great place to work, people friendly, full gym onsite, outside walking trail 1 mile, flexible hours, multiple departments to chose from, certified doctor onsite,"
good,Good overall company however things are always changing and in collections you must always be adaptable and ready for the changes..management is inconsistent and I’ve had 4 managers who all had different rules for scheduling and such..they will help you advance if you want and have life coaches available...
good,They need new managers people gossip a lot there and blames everyone they mess up instead of them selfsame work load was overwhelming and the manager didn’t know how to do the work
good,"I worked there for 8 years and the pay did not match that.  I was constantly the highest rated person in my department, but the pay wasn't increased in a timely manner."
good,"If you are young this is the place for you, very casual dress attire,I enjoyed the company for the last 3 years but management making many changes. Overall still a good work environment. I personally am not happy in my department with so many changes. Pay grade is decent but you will work very hard for that pay."
good,It was my best place I ever worked the better you are at collecting the more they are going to keep making you go to harder collecting position eventually I just didnt like being on the phones anymore
good,"Its a phone job. That's it.."
good,"Promotions are usually based more on personality and who you kiss up to rather than skill or knowledge. There is no loyalty to current employees. "
good,"very fast paced, talked to maybe over 100 cust. a day. good management, but very busy place to work. had company perks as well, luncheons bbqs ice cream trucks etc"
good,"It's different and complex......each day you sign on and take calls breaks are 15 mins part time and two 15min breaks and one 30min lunch for full time. Breaks are paid, lunches aren't. Training system constantly changes, which is annoying. Hardest part is not getting smart with customers on the phone."
good,"really repetitive, pay is good after you've worked there for over a year, benefits are good, customers are the worst part, hard to move up, this job is really if you're okay being unhappy to get the money"
good,Provides job security and good benefits great people working for the company provides a comfortable atmosphere. Would definite recommend discover as a great place to work
good,Overall It was a nice place to work. Pay was decent. Phone calls were back to back. They were very LGBT friendly and that is a huge thing for me because I identify as non binary.
good,"Discover was a good company to work for.  Great benefits, flexible schedule and a competitive, constructive environment.  There wasn't much opportunity to advance and the career path was ill-defined."
good,"This was a typical HR job with typical HR duties working with soon to be retirees and helping them through the process of transitioning out of the company.  Later, my duties turned to more typical HR duties by working with the Marketing Department and managing their HR issues.  This was a good job but I had discovered that my kids were needing me to more at home and my commute was 1 1/2 hours one way."
good,"you are able to get customer service and call center experience that you can put on a resume and take elsewhere... career growth is very slow... ... and when they have a layoff, they don not call it a layoff to avoid negative public image... they tell you you have to voluntarily resign by the effective date to get your severance and be considered a re-hire... if you don't agree to resign, they terminate you and you are considered not a candidate for re-hire..."
good,"my time at discover was short, the people i worked with were alright, there was not much time to get to know your teammates, my manager would always not be at their desk to answer questions."
good,management is horrible they do not have compassion for employees treat everyone as they are expendable if you find a decent manager keep them they willhelp a great deal
good,"I started the job as first helping people with their application process."
good,"It was a decent job, I enjoyed, The company was not upfront about the schedule and hours , which caused me to leave the company . The company overall was good"
good,They are very good at their job culture. They make you feel important and they do try to motivate you with benefits like concert tickets. The job is very customer service based and they strive for excellence meaning there is quite a bit of critiquing.
good,"The culture is a positive, and so is the career path provided you are not in a communications or administrative assistant role.  There are no career paths for these positions."
good,Discover was my first job after graduating college. It taught me workplace culture. Discover also taught me how to communicate and handle conversations with people from all over the world.
good,When I worked at Discover Card I was very happy going through 1st and part of 2nd stage of training but when we were moved under a new team- manager was off on LOA and company provided another manager to take her place. There was not consistent follow-up training during that point and a willingness to work with our team to improve so we could better ourselves and our job.
good,Call volume can be really crazy and you can easily take over 100 calls a day. Classroom training is only really for like a couple of weeks and the rest of the time you take phone calls.
good,Discover is a great stepping stone to advance within your career. Having discover looks good on your resume and allows you to take the next step. A day to day workday at discover however is exhausting. Customer Service reps do not get the pay or attention that they need to feel appreciated. The company perks are however pretty fun if you earn it.
good,I had very short time spent at discover so not very much sure to advise on many of the things 3 months is very sort duration for any analysis but management can be improved.
good,"have to have a strong mind to work here. cant let people get under your skin "
good,"The company can be a great place to work.  However, I found multiple people in leadership positions to be lacking in many basic functions necessary for a significant financial institution; the 80/20 rule is easily identified throughout the company.  Most of the organization is siloed and cross-departmental collaboration is difficult due to significant volumes of competitiveness and backstabbing.  It's difficult to move up and advance in the company as the organization seems more interested in bringing talent from outside the company than promoting within.  Pay is decent and benefits are good."
good,"They expected you to lie, trick and be pushy about selling their products even when a card member couldn't afford it.  They would write you up if you weren't selling their products even when people said no."
good,"It's been forever since I've worked here, but the benefits were great and the people were even better.  Great cafeteria, awesome food, but wouldn't work here again"
good,It was a good job didn't intend to leave. Great management and co workers. Care about employees. Pay could of been better. You can transition quickly to other positions.
good,"Fast-paced call center.  May/may not advance--mostly depends on who you know, not your knowledge base.  Good opportunity for those just starting out or who enjoy being on the phones all day."
good,Working for Discover is nice. It is fast paced with an extremely high call volume which takes some adjusting to. Overall the cafeteria and employees were nice people to be around.
good,"I started as a part time employee, loved my department and management. However after being promoted 2 months later than initially told. I had terrible management and the work load was outrageous. The entire team I was on would plead to the GM about our management and nothing would be done. The manager was never at her desk or around for any questions the team needed answering. New information didnt hit the team until after calls were marked down or audited. Calls were back to back all day long, and in total you only got 45 minutes off the phone for an 8 hour shift."
good,"A typical day at work was having a huddle team meeting, preparing for are day of work."
good,"I was a very tenured employee who had amazing stats and was a team player, yet for years no one wanted to or cared to help me advance my career. Hense why I left. There are instances where you can get stuck in a mediocre position with absolutely no one to help you get out of that role. I hope one day Discover realized this and fixes this flaw. I can't possibly be the only good employee who left for this reason."
good,"I enjoyed working for Discover for most of time time it use to be a very family oriented company.  Then changes arose and it was a totally different environment,"
good,I did not like working here. This was just a stepping stone to something more. I was here to pass the time and to pad this review. Why do you have to fill this out? Just post my resume.
good,It is a great company but their grading system is ridiculous. Management was ok. I just didn't like the feeling of going overboard and not getting recognize for it.
good,The entire day was slam packed with phone call after phone call and because it was entry level there was a lot of drama on the call floor along with petty politics.
good,working in customer service means you'll just be taking inbound calls from Discover Card/Bank customers and servicing their financial needs and advising them on financial needs
good,"It was just  not for taking calls back to back then dealing with customers face to face, a loy of them were pretty rude and yelling.In trying ti et away from that."
good,Floor managers like to dictate every last thing you do even if you're productive and it's hard to say that they are good people when they can't keep their promises
good,"Discover was a good place to work. However, salaries were not as competitive as other banks in the area.  Management was fair, but at times lacked communication."
good,Typical day is fast paced and can be rewarding at times.  Manager is very hands off and will step in when requested.  Upper management of company is strong and has company as a whole pointed in right direction.
good,Very stressful making these kinds of calls to people to try to collect funds when they are without work or can not at the time come up with the funds to make payments.
good,"It was a job.  I had just graduated and it worked for me at the time.  Although, as I started to look into trade school, they were doing away with my shift, which would have make it impossible for me to work there.  So it worked for me to leave to attend trade school."
good,Meet a lot of fun people you work with. Team Leader helps and trains you to succeed in within the company. its a repetitive type of job for outgoing and incoming calls.
good,Discover is a very good business to work for. I normally come into work and clock in. To start my day I check my emails and log onto the  system to start calling card members who are delinquent.
good,While at discover card I was treated well. Never had any type of issues with payroll or time occasionally an error on my bonus check but of course always corrected.
good,The job was not what I expected at all. They paid me 12$ dollars an hour and I had no benefits because I was part-time. I had no paid time off. I was only able to view my schedule at work which is horrible considering how often they make changes to the schedule.
good,"Discover still runs their head quarters like we were still in 1990.  There's a big difference in how salary and hourly employees are treated  The only positive about working there is the salary, they do pay well.  But, you also work 50-60 hours a week."
good,Discover tries its best to make work as fun as possible. Especially when having long stressful days. Cafeteria on site. Offer free counseling and flexible schedules to help employees
good,Excellent Benefits. Paid Training. Good Work environment. My team lead and coach were both very helpful. I would recommend this company to students. Fun place to work.
good,While I have enjoyed my time at Discover Financial there is little opportunity to grow with the company.  The company is hardhearted in Chicago so if you want to advance in the company you will have to be in a position to relocate to Chicago.
good,Discover has lots of flexibility and give you lots of training in the credit card industry. Tries to keep work life fun opportunities to advance are there with hard work and good performance
good,"great place to work if you dont want a life, great place to work if you dont really care about life balance and just want to make money. has great benefits and extra hours are always available."
good,"I worked there awhile ago, so things may have changed. When I worked there managers were shifted around quite a bit. In any given year it was unlikely to have the same manager for more than 9 months. Weekends were required to work. It's a great place to work out of high school. The turnover rate was quite high, but I enjoyed it there."
good,"Overlooked the proper allocation of resources on the right place. Not a very good team environment. "
good,Tasks are given out throughout the week and can be adjusted daily or by the hour. This environment is ever changing and is always on the fast track to success. Workplace culture is great for some areas and could be better for other areas.
good,Make sure you get in a click to advance. Really need to know someone to get some promotion. But while I was there I can say I received some important experience.
good,"In the Collections department, it is more sales than collections. It makes you feel like you don't do anything correctly because you are monitored by many team leads at the same time, telling you what you did wrong or should have done. Very stressful. Most enjoyable part of the job was payday."
good,"they take in a high number of calls but didnt always have the staff to support such a load of calls, they provided fun activities but you didnt always have the chance to participate because you are always on the phone"
good,It was a difficult place for me. I am a university student and they lied to me about schedules and such. I had a good experience the months I served but I wasn't too happy.
good,"Growth is hard and it is still ""clic"" like atmosphere. Lots of brown-nosing needed in order to advance and changes are you're probably still smarter than the management you're working for."
good,Not the best place when it comes to management but its good. they test your knowledge well. lots of good people and you make friends. they will pat you on the back when you do a good job. good benefits.
good,"collecting on past due credit accounts. good training program, coaches could be a bit harsh, but overall work environment was good"
good,Stressful when dealing with upset card members. Had to meet month goals on dollars collected. Management tried to make the work environment fun and upbeat. Coworkers were great to work with. Benefits were great.
good,Conducted investigations on alerts escalated to cases. I learned more about money laundering through credit cards. Co-workers were close and everyone got along.
good,"Worked here for over a year and a half, the employees are great, benefits are ok, but do have some good perks. Good amount of opportunity to move to different departments."
good,"Very boring over time however it is a very easy job. They are very strict about phones on the floor (obviously) so things get very tedious and boring quickly. The culture is okay and they provide free food every once in a while. I don't want to scare you off, its not a bad job at all. Just a little slow."
good,Great place to start if you are working your first real job. Not so employee friendly with those who are well experienced.
good,Discover Card offered great benefits and an excellent 401K plan. I was employed with this company for 12 years and they have one of the best training programs I've seen yet.
good,"Very interesting job, at first it was fun but then it starts to seem like the day goes by so long.  co-workers are awesome and friendly, if you enjoy being on the phone all day then the job is right for you."
good,Don't believe them when they say you can quickly move up in the company. It's a lot harder then they make it sound. You can move up to another customer service department easily but if you are interested in a coach position or a completely different department its almost impossible. They say you can shadow other  positions but It takes months IF you get to shadow at all and they said it would be for 2 hours. I only got 30 minutes. Awesome team. Awesome people in the company. Incredible manager. Awful customers. Great learning experience.
good,I enjoyed talking to the customers on a daily basis.  Unfortunately I was not a fan of having to sell a product n every call.  They had great incentives and took care of their employees each month.  I had great co-workers on my team.
good,A Team Lead oversaw and reviewed all outgoing mail for the center to ensure accuracy and  quality was  maintained. Audited and reported on CSR's that made to many adjustments to customers accounts and forwarded them to all levels of upper management and team leads for coaching opportunities.
good,"Discover has strengths and weaknesses like most companies.  I learned a great deal from Discover including strategic problem solving, excellent time management skills, time management, and lean/six sigma."
good,"Attempted to provide a friendly, comfortable work environment and culture, but some management and staff were difficult based on their personalities, which was no fault of the company."
good,"Riverwoods campus is nice"
good,"Fun work place , many opportunities to grow and develop a career. Constant Change and a lot of Politics. Great place to make friends"
good,Work and life balance is intensive. I would stay up midnight sometimes to work on projects which can be frustrating for family person.
good,Very good for young people coming right out or still in college. It will teach one how to balance work and personal life. Nice environment and good place to work.
good,Collected on past due accounts. Offered financial information and credit counseling. Helped customers bring accounts current
good,Not quit for me. Great company but being a single mother didn't help me out much as far as pay and hours.Part time shift wasn't enough for me
good,The company demanded more and more of time which threw off the work/life balance.  The co-workers were great and it was a fast paced challenging job which stretched my outside of the box problem solving skills.
good,"Performed seasonal job Inputting students application information in to the computer, to help pay for school. Making sure all name, address, dates Etc. are spelled corrected"
good,Policies and procedures were consistent and employee training was well tracked. The pay was typical per state based on specific job functions.
good,"Love the people and the benefits, but it's in the Chicago suburbs so the commute is long if you live in the city. Depending on your management, there can be significant flexibility in your work arrangements."
good,"Wilson;s was a fun company to work for I was promoted raptly. "
good,This was a typical call center job that had a sales component. Hopefully it  has improved since I worked there over 5 years ago.
good,"A lot of knowledge capital with the various operating groups I interfaced with. I learned a significant amount of information about various financial software particularly in the Risk area, along with exercising a sourcing endeavor for finding a new Public Relations agency for the company."
good,"making inbound and outbound calls, full time, negotiating payment arrangements."
good,I started working here after having my daughter. tense environment due to the amount of incoming phone calls handled per day. great pay at the time I was employed.
good,"I had to get a card member on the phone and transfer them to a different member to get a collection on their debt."
good,"The people there are great! Decent benefits. I definitely learned a lot about credit and the basic knowledge of the finance world, however just wasn't the job for me. Calls are back to back in customer service. Policies are ridiculous sometimes. There are so many disclosures you have to read. I felt like I was annoying customers when having to offer the 5% cash back, it felt like a sales job at times."
good,"Resolved a wide range of customer service challenges applying diplomacy & assertiveness to explain issues that may arise. "
good,"My role was to collect on past due accounts via the dialing system. I was able to exceed each months goal and won the prize for that month each time."
good,"Good team environment, immediate manager was very good overall management was not very good and very insensitive to employees needs. Wanted too many hours and did not want additinal pay. Horrible work life balance. Wanted you at the office 7 days a week or you were pressured to be there."
good,"Nice Cafeteria,  good food and large variety. There is a Gym you can join and get a personl trainer, classe, weight, and other good equipment. Health benefits and a Doctor and nurse on staff."
good,"i enjoyed going into work daily because of my co-workers and management , the hardest part would be when i received difficult customers, but that was also  a good learning experience for me , i learned how to handle stressful situations and became more and more equipped to work together with customers and card members."
good,"Answered customer calls and assisted them with their credit card accounts by making changes to their information, payments, credit line increases, etc..."
good,good place to work but not my type of job. to far away of a drive
good,Working in call center is equivalent to legal sweat shop. There are minimal very quick breaks. Customers are realistic to a point.  You are a number and people think you are Discover when you answer the phones. The metrics change so quickly it is impossible to maintain consistent standards and to meet goals. Many coworkers were needing to go out on leave related to stress and anxiety. This job offers excellent benefits but you will need them to cope with continuous criticism and constant threat of losing job if do not meet call metric expectations.  The beginning is great but as you work there it there will be sneaky ways management works to legally rid you of your job. Be wary. Go in with you eyes wide open.
good,Overall a great place to work but unfortunately once you get to a certain level your career options become very limited. There is not a lot of growth opportunities
good,Employee recognition was great on a daily basis. Great learning experience.
good,"They hire people that want to be there for the job. It's not hard, it's just very fast paced incoming calls."
good,They do a good job of promoting from within. They will put you in the spot to do what you do best.
good,"A typical day at work was assisting Customers with their accounts ranging from payments to credit line increases to disputes.  Throughout my experience's I have learned a lot of essential techniques that made Customer service one of the strongest parts of day to day interaction, from personal or professional knowing how to approach, communicate and maintain a meaningful conversation.  I am very fortunate that my co-workers were as engaged and enthusiastic as myself,  we were more like a family than co-workers.  Support, encouragement was a key factor in this.  The hardest part of my job was not having management to back you in policy and procedures.  Lack of communication, no organization.   The most enjoyable part of my job, was knowing that I was able to assist customers and make a difference in their life."
good,work was very slow. I left voice mails all day. people where nice. shifts where long
good,"Discover is a good company, but there are too many people that have been there for 20+ years that are not open to new ideas or processes."
good,Always focus on providing quality deliverables with standards
good,Plenty. I am glad I worked at a credit card company at a young age gaining knowledge in credit
good,A very fast place working environment that requires long hours and attention to detail as every action can cause Production and Client facing issues.
good,Taking back to back calls helping card members and promoting usage was a typical day.
good,Good place to land as a first step in career but not a very challenging work environment. Politics involved everywhere and the severity level depends on different departments.
good,"come to work ....log in computer, sign onto phone.....start taking inbound calls from cardmembers regarding disputes. Also would sometimes come to work and have to act in different capacity depending on what the business needs where. Woked as team coach , responsible for filling in when supervisor not present, and assisting co workers with day to day functions and issues. Took escalated calls from co workers, and tried to remedy situation and provide customer with satisfaction. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the various personalities of my co workers, and maintaining my professional protocol. The most enjoyable part was helping co workers that were having performance issues, and later seeing the strides they made to improve their performance. It really meant a lot to me when a co worker would come up to me and say thanks for helping them, that made my day."
good,"Even as a supervisor your priority is phone time. YOu are expected to coach and manage a team of 10-18 people but 20 of those hours MINIMUM are spent on the phone. After that you're luck if you are even able to pull an agent off the phones to coach them on progress. Meanwhile your team's performance is suffering and your managers want to know why you haven't done more coaching. Too much work, not enough pay, no consistency across board for expectaions as the rules change daily without warning or notice."
good,"Received calls for IT related issues (production and nonproduction and/or development). Production related issues required impact review (If any production impact would determine level and Alert management, then convene IT support staff to resolve)."
good,"Come to work, Clock in, Get on the phone"
good,Constant mail flow and processing customer information. Mutitasking in all areas to keep the work flowing in order to reach facility goals. Management great to to work with because they also stepped up and helped to reach the goals.
good,"i didnt like it, wasnt really interesting and it was only part time."
good,Discover was a good community to be a part of daily. There are chances to grow within the company and great benefits.
good,Overall good company but bring in outside employees at much higher salaries than internal employees for same work.
good,Discover Finacial Services is a great place to work. Employees are valued
good,"Great Place to work. education assistance, upward mobility available, cafeteria, coffee shop, work out center, and great benefits. If I was not going into a different field I would still working at Discover."
good,Good company very strong top leaders who are good to work for and provide motivation to perform. Company is in a good position to grow. They ha r the drive and focus
good,Overall great place to work if you don't  mind lower pay. My typical work day included insisting my direct manage to coach and help develop teams throughout the day by monitoring phone calls and providing assistant in our chat rooms. During the time that I work there the culture of the company was great as they believed in helping you to achieve daily goals. The most enjoyable part of my day was connecting and assisting my team.
good,I worked in several different departments while at Discover. The last 2 years I worked there was remotely which was great. They were very flexible and treated me well. I think they could pay a little more compared to some of its competitors.
good,I’ve been working here for 2 years and been switched to 2 different departments that i did not choose to be in. All they care about is meeting your stats if not its so much micro management. Very annoying. Only like the pay and work at home option
good,Good place to work. People were always nice at work. Hardest part of the job were the irate customers and the most enjoyable part of the job was lunch time.
good,"Discover hires many high quality folks that were easy to work with while i was with the company."
good,"Loved working for discover until the company took away their bonus program, the pay increase given to existing employees was not even comparable. The company also has terrible management and there is no communication between departments. The management shows favoritism and no one is treated the same what so ever. They made a ton of cuts in 2019 like flex time making people accrue more tardies as well."
good,"I didn't personally love the call center there. But it can be a nice environment, and they have advancement options if you work hard.......      ........"
good,"it was a stable place to work, the management isnt completely fair to all employees and picks favorites. hard to get promoted. pay wasnt too bad but feel like i deserved more"
good,I cant really give my opinion to much I was only temporary and I didn't work In the call center. I worked with paying companies like Tmobile money for advertising.
good,"Provided customer service for Card Members regarding statements, interest rates, and payments.   "
good,Great Organization! Overall an outstanding opportunity! People are friendly and the organization does help employees with career advancement. In addition they have great facilities.
good,"Its an okay job to start at a call center, they really take care of their employees but it is a very structured work day. There is a lot of events that help the employees feel comfortable at work"
good,It’s a good place to work. You get to learn new skills and help the cardmembers get approved for credit they need. The interest rates are a little high and they need new managers. But I do like working there.
good,I have learned a great deal working at Discover Financial and enjoy working with customers the most. This is a call center. A typical day is on the phone in front of a computer.
good,"Great for entry-level positions and interns but not an ideal place if you want to work for a dynamic and innovative company. Good work-life balance, benefits and training opportunities but very weak link between your performance and compensation - it is equally hard to get fired or get promoted no matter how good or bad you are."
good,Discover is altogether a good company but the issue is that there are tons of politics and moving around for someone in tech is difficult to say the least.
good,Enjoy working for Discover. It is about a thirty minute ride and I foster kids so my schedule could be better.  I like the job the cafeteria and the team work. Currently in collections on roller dial which I am not use to.
good,"Make sure you're interested in a call center career. Its an entry level part time position, so they don't have to give you the benefits you should have. You're paid very little and don't receive benefits until you're promoted to full time. The managers are nice and seem to care about your productivity, but they all sell you a dream about a promotion that you wait months for, Only to be promoted to another endless customer service call center position. "
good,"Had many opportunities to transition to various departments if your supervisor recommended you."
good,"The compensation is not great, however you have the opportunity to get promoted quickly. Even still you will not have a great pay. The management needs to change because some are tenured and just don't know their job."
good,Discover has a wonderful work/life balance with flexible PTO and competitive schedules. The culture has recently changed unfavorably due to high call volumes and changes in management.
good,Good place to work for quick money but can become really stressful. All of the people I work with are great and we get along great. it is just that the amount of work for the pay that is given isn't great.
good,"I did not work at Discover long, because the management were not easy to work with. The call floor was very high paced and comfortable. The benefits at Discover are incredible for someone who just got a position there."
good,You are either going super fast or you are bord out of your mind. The benefits are fantastic and the work life balance for part time employee's​ is really good also.
good,This was a good place to work environmentally.  I worked in collections which I just wasn't a good fit for.  The medically/dental/vision benefits were great and started on day 1 of employment.  I can also say that the training for the position was very well done.
good,"When you are having your interview they make it seem like the best place in the word. I would have to disagree. They constantly harass you about numbers and make you feel bad about yourself. Instead of helping you they just tell you that you're not doing what they want. Unless you are full time there are absolutely no benefits. If you miss 5 days because of illness you are fired. The management is there because they are loyal, not intelligent and sometimes it is embarrassing to know you work under such uneducated individuals. The job is boring. You take call after call for hours on end with one 15 minute break. The pay is low compared to the responsibility. Honestly, I could go bag groceries and make as much. The only positive is the coworkers. They seem to higher genuinely nice people."
good,"I enjoy the culture at Discover, and feel that I am valued most of the time. Although there are some hold ups for employees who are educated. It is difficult to advance very far within the company without knowing someone personally that can get you promoted. I find there there is a lack of innovation as well, and often times employees are not heard. I think the benefits are fair, and the environment is comfortable for the most part."
good,I like working for the company. Some departments are better than others. Your opinion and experience on work environment has a lot to do with team managers. Has chances of advancement for some people. There are people employed with the company for 20 plus years not given a chance of advancement then you have people there with only 2 years of employment and has had many advancement opportunity. Pay grades need some serious work.
good,Discover does make employees feel as if they truly care about the development and growth; not only in their career but in life and credit management.
good,"Great benefits, high volume of calls, energetic environment and lots of training and support from upper management. Good company overall to work for. Just make sure you are constantly engaging and being knowledgeable about their services and products."
good,"Come  in deal with peoples BS , lots of pros , Lots of cons. Saddest part is it is super corporate. and getting worse every year! They are getting bigger and under compensating employees as the company grows and the cel and management get huge Increases they have a higher quota to have turnovers than to retain the current employees because they can save money by hiring a new person than to keep giving people 10 cent raises every year. But , hey It could be worse."
good,"A company that is deeply rooted in the  Banking and Credit Card industry.  Discover is a professional company that has a reputation for excellence and their employees deliver superior customer service.  A company that a person could potentially grow and move into leadership roles and management."
good,Good company to work for especially if it is your first job. It is difficult to advance in the company. Job is easy in the Fraud Analyst pay attention to detail. Don't expect to have weekends off at this job for awhile.
good,"Decent work environment and provides excellent training. Just like any other big companies, you have to prove yourself to stay ahead."
good,"I really liked my job until it felt repetitive, of course you get the anger customers but  Collecting is not for everyone."
good,"- Techinally lagging behind."
good,"Employees can find a stable job, though it is very demanding at times.  It is a very top-heavy organization so career advancement is sometimes difficult.  The people who work there are wonderful and are typically willing to help out if they can."
good,"great place to work minus a few things, if you like a constantly changing atmosphere this is the place for you, the collections management team is amazing love them."
good,"During a typical day at work, I collect on delnquent accounts, trying to reach daily and monthly goals set by myself as well as my team leader. My team leader is pretty cool, I'm not really a fan of micro-management though, luckily she's a great coach. My co-workers are team players and are really a joy to work with. They make my days go smoothly. The hardest part of my job is trying to put my feelings to the side and get the job done. (ex. collecting when people are ill, just got out of the hospital, etc.) I really enjoy my co-workers and their input."
good,Took incoming and outbound calls for customers in different units within Discover. I had a supervisor in bank for three years that was fabulous. I want to thank her for all the great work she did. Taking calls all day one after another is the hardest part and not always have the correct tools. Health benefits have to be the number one perk of the job.
good,"Call center work, making out bound or inbound collection calls or sales calls. You must be good with computers."
good,It is a great place to work but with the wrong hours the job can assume your life. I have no free time outside of work. It is unfortunate. I do feel like Discover has great management but there are some that don't promote company advancement. This can be quite discouraging.
good,"It's a great company to work for, amazing benefits and amazing values. The goals are a bit high(close to perfect) just to keep the job. If your not perfect, they don't want your services."
good,"not bad after all, very friendly stuff and flexible. unfortunately management could be better."
good,DFS is a very good company to work for. Plenty of opportunities to move up.
good,A very strong emphasis on numbers and a lack of emphasis on employee but its not all bad. Good benefits are offered. Management had large areas of improvement.  
good,"Somewhere in the growth of the company, politics took over and created at times a difficult work environment to succeed in. The entire company has evolved from the initial launch in 1985 and the atmosphere is much more cut throat and political in today's environment than in the beginning."
good,I worked for this company before they moved to New Albany so we didn't have the fitness center ext. They did offer incentives almost everyday we had some kind of raffle going on for prizes. My only complaint was they timed you if you needed to use the restroom and just the thought of someone watching the clock was very difficult for me. I never was questioned about it but others had been.
good,There is no oppurtinity of advancement at Discover. Busy call environment with few breaks. The company offers incentive but very few people get it. Much different than what I was told in my initial inverview.
good,"A typical day at work would include inbound calls for 8hrs. I was able to learn patience . Management was excellent, very flexible and they worked around your schedule as best as possible. My co workers were nice in the midst of a hostile collections environment."
good,incoming and outgoing calls
good,Discover was a good place to work. A lot of younger people work there that are not as goal-oriented as I am. Some childish complaints from employees when customers have ligitimate concerns. Benefits are great though. Management is not as outgoing and personable as other jobs I've pursued.
good,"Training/meeting new people, great!"
good,Non-threatening workplace with an amicable team. Growing rapidly in the international markets with its unique positioning. Enhancing its visibility as a domestic brand with regularly winning JD Power for customer satisfaction.
good,"It was a good place to work, but its just a call center so back to back calls all day. It pays well, and they have a lot of opportunity for growth, but all positions would be based on the phones."
good,"If you enjoy being on the phones def work here. After a day of taking calls it gets really draining. The food from the cafeteria was pretty good but just know that it’ll take like 10-20 mins to get your food which sucks! If you work from like 9am-3pmish good luck on finding parking close to the building. The benefits are really nice I def liked the benefits. When I worked here I felt that I was always there. Also, if you want weekends off good luck because it’s not an option unless you either trade shifts or do flex (I think that’s what it’s called) where you get like 2 Saturdays/sundays off and work the other two of the month. But you really need to fake it until you make it. I do recommend to get into a specialty ASAP! I also think the PTO you receive is not enough personally. Its about 4 weeks it’s reasonable if you’re not a higher up. Just know that people who work on the second floor will most of the time take the elevator when you’re on the fourth floor which is kind of annoying."
good,"Discover is a great company to work for, it has great benefits, fun events/activities , lots of free food. The work itself is stressful. I came here right after HS, but the job gave me high blood pressure, depression and anxiety. Talk to a rude customer? Gotta suck it up and take the next call like it didn't happen. Over 100 calls a day.. I'm sure the job is great once you're able to move to a management position."
good,"It's a great company but they need to have professionalism clearly established on all teams. At present, there is a lack of professionalism and then the person who wants to be a professional becomes the fall guy for all the ridiculously immature people."
good,"personal development was there at first but really depends on department manager. "
good,Work flow and culture was good. You have to remember you sit down all day and do repetitive stuff. Hours were good pay was ok. Hardest part was to sell products and keep it a goal or your out. I prefer to be happy helping customers and help them vs selling
good,"Flexible place to work, however exempt positions lack direction the majority of the time and contain no support from upper management.  Loved working there but the stress of trying to just ""figure it out"" became stressful and unappreciated by upper management."
good,"Great benefits, decent pay and wonderful people to work with. Loved the culture over all. But was let go without being out through the process prior to being terminated, was just let go. Systems are a serious issue, always crashing and causing customers to be upset and causing stats to be poor as well. Which your stats are based on performance which is lagging because of the system issues, also effects your incentive payout.  Would no longer recommend this company to friends for work due to how my termination was handled."
good,"I experienced many great people and learned about financial business, however there was a lack of professionalism in management. My team worked very hard for a boss that was not qualified to make the proper judgements to efficiently run a dept."
good,"Good atomosphere and the perks are wonderful. Management was fair, but career opportunities were minimal."
good,"managers only care about their bonuses. "
good,"Every day was a challenge, Company always made an effort to compensate difficult nature of day to day challenges. It was easy to learn in this environment from all of the excellent managers."
good,"review main task and setting a goals by hour or by day"
good,Discover was a fun place to work just needed better benefits and a better transition time for growing with the company. The management team was great and all in for work life balance.
good,"Working under the is definitely a mismatch between the pay given to an employee for the amount of work done. The job is focused on sales, however there is a big opportunity on the incentive structure of the company under this job role."
good,"Discover was a good company to work for and are poised to continuously bring value to its customers. The thing with the company that could have been much better was to take care of the homegrown talent. Many of the positions are call center centric (team leaders, coaches, customer service reps) and there is tremendous talent wasted on the phones. When there are talent that want to promote, the salary is so bad in comparison to new hires fresh out of college. The new hires who join a strategy or analytical type role make much more than those team leaders (managers) who have been with the company for 10+ years.  In order to get paid, you have to join after having plenty of experience or leave the company and come back several years later. Other than that, the culture was extremely laid back and had an excellent work life balance but often times, the talent is not fully pushed or utilized to their potential. This stems from a lack of good managers who are not leaders but rather inexperienced college graduates. So this is a great place to improve but by comparison to other companies in the financial industry, it's single/double A ball as opposed to the major leagues."
good,I enjoy working at Discover. I have learned many new skills I may not have learned without this opportunity such as multitasking and how to manage my time better to make the most of my day and be productive.
good,"Definitely different than projected regarding both culture and always changing working hours and schedules. Often challenges in, with daily parking too."
good,"Get into work, logon to your computer and take calls. Calls can range from two minutes to an hour. Agents are split between groups based on their work schedules.Sometimes theres would be a very hectic day and dealing with back to back calls. Discover rewards their agents with prizes, bonuses, vacation time, food and games."
good,Really good company to work for great benefits from day one.   a lot of potential to move up.  It was a job you can leave at work at the end of the day you didn't have to bring anything home with you.   Systems always ran well and were easy to understand and work through.
good,Good place to work for quick money but can become really stressful. All of the people I work with are great and we get along great. it is just that the amount of work for the pay that is given isn't great.
good,"I personally do not enjoy call centers in which I am pretty biased, however Discover was great. The management is the reason I left and the way I was treated personally. Great place for those who like call centers though."
good,Discover Financial Services provides wonderful benefits and 25 days of paid time off (to start) ensuring you maintain a healthy work-life balance. Casual work environment.
good,"Take over 120 calls a day, customer service is a roller coaster of emotions. Management is mostly externally hired having never done customer service. Coworkers are amazing. Hardest part is having customers scream at you. Most enjoyable part is competing for high call scores to earn a team lunch."
good,"engaging training class, everyone is very friendly and easy to approach.  lots of support and fun contests on the sales floor"
good,"The company is nice, they provide many benefits to their full-time workers and a positive environment at work Lies and false promises are a problem, as management and the hiring staff have promised us things that we never received. Scheduling is very difficult and the work is very heavy, calls are constant and it is hard to keep up with the companies demands."
good,"Daily work day consist of assisting users, scheduling and performing Windows 7 migrations, troubleshooting various applications"
good,"1. A typical day would be conference calls "
good,"Discover is a great place to work with lots of free food and nice people. However, the breaks are very short for working long 10-12 hour days. Some days you have to go in at 6AM so it's really hard to get your sleep schedule on track."
good,"I didn't work there very long, a mere six months. I love the company, amazing benefits that start at day 1 and the people I worked with were great. BUT you are expected to be a peach on the other side of the line where customers are allowed to scream, cuss and pretty much tell you that you are the scum of the earth, all while saying, ""I understand."" "
good,Discover is a good solid company.  They provide stability.  Work life balance is a big party of their values.  Management is very good at providing as much as they can about the direction of the company ect.
good,"A typical day at DC was 4 hrs of daily phone time sometimes more when needed, also received escalated supervisor calls daily.  I coached my team for 3.5 hrs per day. I learned how to manage my time and how to coach to the many different types of personalities that people portray. In the Coach role I managed my team throughout the day by one on one coaching’s, emails, and via the chat rooms. I was acting TL in TL's absence.  Coworkers were all available and helpful when not on the phone.  The hardest part of the job was managing my team while on the phone.  The most enjoyable part of my job was coaching my team and being able to see them grow."
good,"Personally enjoyed the job for the aspect of money couldn't find the right balance of personal and work life, things you learned in training almost became irrelevant once you hit the floor because things change so rapidly"
good,Discover Card truly believes and follows their Mission and Vision to help ensure the right balance of services and profitability for our customers and cardholders.
good,"The co-workers are awesome and motivational. Many of the supervisors try their best to answer questions and resolve issues. A typical day at work is handling accounts that have become delinquent. some customers are genuinely concerned and want to get in good standing. Some customers are challenging and require an explanation as to why it is important to maintain a great payment history. Overall the job will provide experience with customer service related issues, educating the customers in regard to their account and developing strong social, data entry and problem solving skills."
good,"A typical day is busy, busy. Management encourages growth. Co-workers are my best friends at work. The hardest part of my job is learning Microsoft Access. Most enjoyable part is contest that make work environment fun."
good,This is just a stepping stone for most of the people who will ever work there. Beware of any employer who gives you 4 weeks of paid vacation time per year. They do that to prevent burn-out and this is one of those jobs that burns you out.
good,"Nice people, Great workplace. Free stuff. Great training.Nice cafeteria."
good,"The hardest part of this job is working with families that are in true hardships. Hearing and learning their experiences, especially those who truly want to concede to their responsibilities but have been devastated by events beyond their control, such as hurricanes and other various uncontrollable life devastating events. The best part of this job is being able to find a resolution working with clients who have experienced a life changing event and developing a positive client relationship with them."
good,"That environment at Discover is fantastic. The people and the managers are all great. The pay is pretty good, and they have good benefits. The work itself is very hard, and just about every call was an angry customer that was yelling over something dumb. It gets draining having to deal with that all day."
good,"There are multiple ""work cultures"" at Discover. The Risk management group can be a fun group to work with, however if you aren't located at headquarters, advancement opportunities are not as easy. The work life balance is awesome and one of the best things about working at Discover."
good,I enjoyed for the most part working for Discover. I enjoyed the early morning shift I had which was from 5 am to 1:30 pm. I loved to help people inside the company and customers over the phone.
good,"This was a very bright place to work, often stressful at times the company made it a point to keep the morale up among the employees. the training was solid and they too time to ensure you had a full understanding of the tasks at hand before letting you go to the sales floor."
good,"Discover had a very friendly work environment, working there kept me busy at all times and management was also always ready to step in and help whenever they could. They’ve also held us to a standard they knew we could accomplish so setting goals was a big part of the company."
good,Good place to work but many people tend to park it there. Most people are not very motivated and lack ambition and also a formal education. That is why i decided to leave. Its a call center so unless your moving to the head quarters in Illinois dont bother.
good,Not bad place but management needs some improvement. I enjoyed work here . Friendly people . Good this is about company is benefits and work balance life. stress full place some time . Most company culture as per usual
good,"was a good time working there, i knew it was a dead end from the start. i wanted to be an accountant and there were no possibilites to work as an accountant there."
good,"I loved working for Discover! Everyone was polite and the work culture was absolutely addicting! However, culture does not pay the bills! If Discover worked on more competitive salaries for non-phone supporting roles as well as appreciate why those roles are important ( positions like Reporting Analysts, Quality Control, Data Architects),  they would be in a great spot for using internal talent  for advanced analytics. Don’t be afraid to invest in your employees paychecks and stay competitive! Yes, the market is booming for support roles and so are your competitors starting rates!"
good,This job was great as far as call centers go. For me personally I wanted more hourly pay but the job itself was enjoyable. I enjoyed helping cardholders and the work atmosphere was also great.
good,It sounds like the perfect company to work for when you are in the interview process. Then you find out later that its not all true- they change your schedule and you find out later if you asked to work rotating weekend that means 3 out of the 4 weekends in the month you will be working. Trainer does a great job! but you are promised incentive and all these fun thing that never happen- they recently removed the incentive program and replaced it with a more program that you will probably never get any incentive with. breaks are short and they are not flexible or understanding when it comes to schedule.
good,"I'm not satisfied with the fact that they can just change my hours to work when ever they feel like it. It's forcing me into a corner if health of me and my unborn baby or a pay check, really unfair."
good,"Discover Card is a good company, nice benefits. It's a great place to work if you like to live in a cubical, and help customer's with financial plans."
good,"Discover card was okay, but I think it was because I worked in the collections department. I think I would have liked it better if I worked somewhere else. The company its self made the employees feel good, they constantly had things going on to help moral. The building is super nice with a gym, starbucks, sushi bar, and tons of other things."
good,"Discover is a fast paced call center. The management team does all they can to work with you and make sure you get the help you need while on a call. They give great benefits and offer part time, full time, and seasonal positions."
good,Just because everyone is trained the same does not mean they retain it the same. Discover is a great example of this in the credit card field as not all of the agents are on the same page.
good,"I worked at Discover for about 2.5 years. I was promoted 3 times working there. Promoted to web support/chat specialist. Working there can be very draining with all the rude cardmembers you get. They have a team called celt who scores the calls and they would score down if you had a mono tone saying you do not sound very jolly or did not use enough jolly words. My job title was specifically web support/ chat specialist, but us chat specilaist would get kicked off of chat often to take calls. Before I left they were trying to make web support team to take customer service calls because they were saying we werent busy enough. Even though we were always busy."
good,"local manager was great, district manager was not. do to character, I do not want to discuss displeasure of district manager, due to my situation is based and according to my own faults."
good,Discover has a fantastic training program and helped me feel that I am even better when working in customer service. The paid time off was great. The hours could have been better.
good,"My day starts at 5am making call to clients and contacting them and transfer them the Jewelers which is a code name for the collector. twice a week we will have development training to become a collector. I learn a lot about Fare Credit Act and the laws in regards to interacting with clients. My management is great he show great interest in our grow and development give constant coaching on a one on one basic. The work place is active there is always something going on, contest potlucks to created and employee friendly place.The hardest part of the job the wait for clients to answer the phone and the time that I had to wait to practice to become a real collector. the most enjoyable part about my job is getting a transfer and getting a payment from the client also there are nice people that I work with we motivated each other"
good,"The management was overall very professional. It was pretty fast-paced and stressful, but there are many opportunities for advancement.  Also, the benefits are nice."
good,"The atmosphere is very friendly and the medical benefits are great; however, the job function is unforgiving. Many people are very unhappy with their financial standing and like to take it out on the person trying to help them. This happening day after day greatly wears on ones emotions. The company is very skilled at creating a competitive environment to increase their employees work performance, which also creates a very stressful situation for the employee. Workload is increased to a point where it becomes unmanageable without further compensation, only with offer to step down and take a pay cut to do the same job you were doing before the workload was increased."
good,Discover is best described as a place that will give you great oncentive and benefits to perform well at a less than fulfilling job. If your motivated by helping frustrated customers then you have found heaven.
good,"They always had competitions going for employees, incentives and bonuses.  Hardest part was the pay, did not pay enough for what was asked of the employees."
good,Discover prides itself in diversity of employee. It encourage employees to contribute innovative ideas to help build the culture of the company. Discover's primary objective is to satisfy it's customers first.
good,I did learn new things every day and the coworkers were really involved in their job. We always had group meetings and if we needed help there was a group chat. It was a different environment than any other place I have worked at.
good,its a great starter. very good with working with people with families. has fun events. a place to begin and for most also their ending. just be aware of the change all the time
good,"Great values, Easy to move in position once you have gotten the hang of the job. You will be feed a lot just because pot lucks"
good,I worked for Discover for over 19 years.  They were good to me and I advanced through the company.  I enjoyed the great benefits they provided me.  I would recommend working for them.
good,"On someday""s you cam take more than 100+ plus calls. Low sales incentive with a very high turn over rate. On site gym and cafeteria."
good,The structure here is actively focused on and new ideas are embraced. Many promotions are political from managers and above.
good,"This company has probably the best work culture I've ever experienced. The location in SLC is great as it has its own lake area, personal gym, cafeteria, personal medic and secured parking. "
good,Wasn't the job for me the pressure to sell I couldn't handle and at the time my team leader was not always around to help but they have fixed that now which is great.
good,"Discover is a wonderful place to work and is very fun.  Most of the management is very down to earth and easy to get along with.  The biggest negative is that although there are advancement opportunities after you become an advanced verification analyst, those opportunities do not come with a raise until you become a team leader which usually takes about 5 years."
good,I liked discover as a company but the management in new albany was terrible
good,The energy and excitement for the company is contagious. The only problem I had was pushing products that I didn't believe in. As long as you can do the job then you will love the people and positive environment!
good,Discover Card was a nice place to work for my supervisor was not a very nice person and made my work life awful but other than that I would work there again.
good,"Great JOB to have while attending school. Your typical day at work consists of being on the phones generally and helping customers through problems, collections etc. I've learned to deal with corporate politics as they do run rampant here. Having said that, the benefits are fantastic even though the wages are not very competitive compared to local call centers. Fairly stress free environment."
good,"Very procedural, indifferent, number driven. Do make an effort to keep employees happy but it's transparent in my opinion. low pay but I worked there many years ago"
good,"The on-boarding and training processes were great, but very intensive. Excellent benefits, decent pay, and options for advancement. However, on-the-job development is clunky and there weren't enough coaches to go around. By the end of my time there, I would only get thirty second conversations on topics that warrant more in-depth discussions."
good,"I loved the culture that discover had created however the management team was lacking, the career paths they offered to promotion was almost non existent and nearly impossible to qualify for, and they flag you hard for even the smallest infraction, the compensation is very generous though including great healthcare coverage, on site gym and doctor and great food options, the company itself out forth a lot of effort for its employees however the salt lake cite in my opinion is not managed by in a way that promotes employee retainment, if you dont perform exactly how they ask even if you get the same results than your not what they want."
good,"Discovercard used to be a great company to work for, But when they dissolve their partnership with Morgan Stanley. Hourly employees were stripped of all commissions and and incentives and were relegated to bare bones hourly. this slash in income was a product of the crash of 2008. Because to this trop in pay my car was repossessed. My house was foreclosed. And I had to file bankruptcy."
good,"It's a great place to work for the culture. The people are friendly and for the most part they want to see you be successful. However, I feel like they make it hard for you to be successful. I feel this way because I have had numerous times where I wasn't informed about a policy until it was to late. Don't know if that is the overall company or just the department I've been in. It's differently hard to be successful in a career that doesn't always offered all the tools for continued growth. I do however love the culture and the people I've meant in discover. I would just advice to beware of all policy's since it seems management doesn't always tell them to you honestly. "
good,"The work wasn’t hard just there is just a lot of it. I haven’t worked there in a while but I have considered it as a part time job. "
good,"Most people enjoy working at Discover, but this is not the job for me. I do not like constantly talking on the phone and did not like the competitiveness of the workplace. I also do not like the telemarketing aspect of this job. However, Discover does offer great employee benefits and room for advancement which is great if you would like to work in a financial insinuation."
good,"Discover financial is a company which can be helpful in building professional relationships with customers as well as fellow employees. The pay leaves something to be desired. I enjoyed my time working there because of the easy-going atmosphere. However, I knew I needed another job to pay for the necessities of life. Overall, I think its a good job for a student type individual or someone looking for a part time job."
good,"Managers and supervisors were TOO focused on the employees interaction and wellness before the companies needs. False promises made for advancement when degrees were earned, Excuses and lip service were common as you addressed issues and concerns involving advancement. HR vacation and sick leave policy punishes the employee by not allowing logical notification of the supervisor of sick time request which counts as a call off and strike on your employee record even though the employee has the time to take off. Promised a flexible 30 hour work schedule but was misled and informed about how flexible it was."
good,"This job is fine If you don't mind having your schedule fluctuate a lot, and being lied to about how many weekends you have to work a month. In the interview they will tell you that you only have to work one Saturday a month but come to find out you work 4 Saturdays in a row then have one Saturday off. Repeat."
good,I enjoyed my time there it was exciting to come into work each day because I worked with a great group of people. Discover strives to make their environment fun and engaging.
good,"Good company to build career experience at. Competitive. There are a lot of different branches of marketing here, good to get the view from a large company."
good,"DFS is a great company to work for is you want Work Life Balance. However, they do not pay per industry standards."
good,"Excellent benefits but kind of boring and sedentary work environment. Too many incentives to just do what you are paid for."
good,"The pace of work is reasonable, the expectations are fair, the compensation is okay, the company is incredibly stable and well managed at the top, and the people are friendly. It is probably a nicer  work environment than most giant corporate offices."
good,"Job work/ life balance is excellent at this company  especially in Marketing. Co -workers are positive and good team players, and work individually and as a team to achieve the end goal of projects."
good,Discover is a great place to work except if your a single parent and need to support your family the pay and raises leave a lot to be desired. The benefits are pretty good you can put your family on the insurance even if your not married and your boyfriends kids as well. I would love to be able to keep my job but with my family i just can not afford to work there anymore.
good,"This is a great company to work with. They take an active role in coaching employees when needed. However, in the department Corporate Security, the work expected out weighs the compensation provided . For this reason alone, as a single parent, I find myself looking for a similar position with a company that pays more."
good,"I spent most of my time working directly with project managers on projects and passing the information on to my team. All projects dealt with researching businesses to see if they accepted Discover card, and if they didn't then we would pass their information on to our sales team. My managers here were great and actually encouraged my advancement in the company."
good,Discover is a good place to work most people that work there tend to stay for multiple years. Iwould recommend discover to anyone looking for a job in an office setting
good,"Discover has great benefits and good pay. Call center work to resolve any questions, concerns or delinquency the customer may have. Discover is very customer oriented which is great and many of the employees there are vey nice. The environment can be stressful and negative which can make the job culture itself hard on a daily bases. The company tries to over come those things with putting on events to win prizes."
good,"Pretty good place to work, reliable with income and great culture. Some issues with advancement depending on department that you’re in. A lot of phone work."
good,"You’re always on the phones, expected to suck up to every customer  no matter what. If you don’t meet stats for two months you get written up. If you’re not on the phone ALL the time, you get in trouble."
good,Discover has been a growing experience in providing high quality customer service buy asking purposeful questions to provide a refreshing effortless experience to card members.
good,A typical day at work was going and getting signed on the phones and taking phone calls. The hardest part could sometimes be having to deal with the rude customers.
good,"The reason I am choosing to leave is because I feel like it drained me emotionally and physically.  i learned that it takes hard work to get recognized in such a large company but i managed to do so and i'm very proud of my self for doing do.  "
good,"You can learn alot, very fast paced environment. Management needs to be more open to ideas. High level decision makers need to be in the process earlier."
good,Discover is a wonderful place to work! If you're looking for a job that values their employees this is definitely the place to go!
good,"It is a great place to work, but when it comes to the pay they did not handle that very well, did not give accurate dates of when you would be receiving raises in your paychecks, which was kind of deceiving to me because they would tell me each month it would be on this paycheck, and then next but nothing."
good,"Despite the sometimes boring job of taking customer calls, the company definitely strives to make the environment fun and motivating. There are always competitions and decorations put up around the call floor as well as games, books, tv's, bean bag couches and arcade games in all of the break rooms."
good,"A typical day would consist of showing up to the company and getting logged onto our computers and telephones. Once logged in we began taking calls from customer's with questions or issues involving their accounts. We had a set list of statistics with goals that we needed to try and hit in order to further the company's trust with our customers. The environment was very fast-paced and enjoyable, with several other co-workers being high-spirited and enjoying their job as well. I loved connecting with each customer and learning a new story with each call that i took. I loved gaining their confidence and making sure they knew we were their to assist them and nothing else mattered. The hardest part of this job was waiting for your statistics to become available each day. I always had very good statistics, but i did not like waiting for them to be released. It was like a game."
good,"A typical day at usually consists of clocking in and waiting for the calls to come in. The way calls are handled at Discover are not like any other collections agency. We are respectful and very kind to the customers. "
good,"Working at Discover was really fun- except when you had to deal with VERY angry customers over the phone. If you're okay with that- then this place could be for you."
good,"is a great place to work, if you dont mind to be on time and track all the time when your in and out the phone, about incentive is hard to get since if you have a tier 1 and adherence less than 89% you will not have any commission."
good,"The management at discover is definitely interesting. There is competition, but only negatively. Other than that, I loved my time as a discover employee."
good,People are very personable. Work life very so so of course being a call center. Great benefits. They have a lot of activities for you and your family to participate in.
good,"Leads would not back you up when it came to difficult customers, made the job overwhelming.  Other than that it was a great environment to work in.. great bonus opportunities, training to move up & free dinners"
good,"Great, fast-paced working environment with tons of opportunities to make friends and play games on your breaks. Management is always on your side with any problems you have and are right by you as you work to fix them."
good,"Now that sales are not part of a customer service position, it would be a great environment to work in. At the time I worked there was a lot of pressures to get sales for products and supervisors were constantly on your back for more."
good,"The company was great to work for, the managers were all supportive and helpful and it was a great environment to work in. My only problems were the rude,awful customers I would have to deal with daily and the slow systems we had to work with"
good,"if you don't mind being sitting and talking on the phone for for 8 hrs straight this is the job for you, the only stressful thing about this job is the grading system."
good,Personally this job wasn't for me. Graveyards were too hard on my mental health and luckily I had amazing supervisors who understood why I couldn't stay.
good,A great environment to work in. Everyone gets along. Acknowledged for great work. The hardest part of the job may have been dealing with frustrated customers.
good,"It is an amazing company to work for. Always getting free things and free food. It is almost so hard to leave the company once you join. I was on the phones and it was great in the beginning but the customers are always angry. And being on the phone is just not meant for everyone and definitely not for the weak. They train you amazingly. It is 8 weeks of training but it is very extensive. They teach you everything they can, and make sure you are good with it before advancing. I loved it but I just got tired of talking on the phones, it got annoying and repetivtive to the point where I had to convince myself to go. benefits are good though, pto for starting out at part time is great. I did have to take a medical leave and that was covered, it was great but a hassle which is expected. But it was a good company, definitely recommend if you like talking on the phone which is non-stop by the way, always have calls coming in. and if you like doing the SAME exact thing everyday and like getting free stuff."
good,"they have very good pay, not really flexible with scheduling. management is very overbearing. calls are back to back and the turn over rate is very high"
good,"Working for a company who has one of the best competitive credit cards in the industry should be exciting, right? Right!  I loved the fact that I had the ability to do what I loved; educate clients and be myself while driving change. Remaining adaptable to change is imperative in this industry and Discover was a great example of a company thriving to remain competitive in the industry against its competitors which drove change regularly. A few opportunities that I identified within management was the lack of organization, communication and professionalism."
good,Good number of days of PTO given by the company. Healthcare cost premiums are rising at ~50% from 13-14...kind of scary.
good,"Overall a good place to work, good benefits, a gym and great in house cafeiteria. Not a lot of opportunities too move up unless you are here for along time. A lot of  micromanagement"
good,"Good place to start out career. I learned a lot in 2 years there. However, limited opportunity for advancement and management is more concerned with their own advancement and does not take the time to help you if it doesnt fit their political agenda."
good,Pay should be better and the call center side is ridiculous with how the agents are scored.  Didn't celebrate enough??? On the other hand spent too much time talking on calls.  hmmmm celebrate?  Maybe spent too much time celebrating
good,"really nice and fun place to work if you are hired on full time."
good,I have mentored and taught 8 people that became my bosses they are not very diversified. Very few minorities are in higher positions and they make the hiring pool very hard for you if you are not Caucasian
good,Nice place to work but the job itself was difficult. The business does everything it possibly can to make up for the customer interactions and is an amazing company for this.
good,"Not the kind of place I would recommend. The ceiling for advancement is is not very high, and even if you do get promoted several times through out the years, you might make 100k. Granted I was in the collections department."
good,This job was great at first but then slowly it got worse and the expectations were outrageous and it's mentally draining. To advance in the company you have to spend a lot of years working there and either get lucky or just wait your turn.
good,"I loved working at discover until my first promotion. They train you for a new type of calls, and then give you a team leader who knows nothing about how to manage."
good,"Typically you spend the day on the phones collecting. I've learned extensive facts about credit and what can effect it, the management is okay, depending on personalities. The hardest part of the job is learning to collect without too much sympathy. The most enjoyable part is learning new skills and attaining all the knowledge the job offers."
good,"Discover work environment is fast paced but the dress code is relaxed.  Shorts, t-shirt, and flip flops almost every day.  Onsite cafeteria is good.  flexible hours and work at home available."
good,"Low salary, limited advancement opportunity, but hey make up for it in PTO.....but, once you get involved in projects, it's almost impossible to use all of the PTO and still get your work done, so it's a catch 20."
good,"great for knowledge, jcpenney is very boring as far a culture no fun or anything, but ok pay not the best, nothing special"
good,"Management has favorites and advancement is hard if you are not one of them. Call center environment, but room to get off the phones"
good,"I have many friends who stayed here. I chose not to. "
good,"A good place to work, for the most part. I am not very confident in the business outlook as a whole. All product development is at a standstill, and competitors offer better options for credit cards."
good,I enjoyed working at Discover. My only complaints were the salary (fairly low for what I was doing) and the hours (I had a weird 11-8 schedule which wasn't healthy for my family).
good,"Overall I value any experience that has brought me this far including discover , The locations and drive is taxing , the culture is inspiring , the day to day isn't up to expectations but campus is beautiful."
good,"Busy, productive, always something going on. Managing a team up to 30 employees to include hiring, motivating, recognizing and rewarding, coaching, counseling, training and problem solving. "
good,"Discover is a great place to work if you like to talk with others and problem solve. They like to promote within and the training coaches/classes are one of the best parts if you struggle a bit. Company volunteer opportunities are inspiring, and they like to recognize their employees with rewards through a competitive environment. I do not recommend if you are unable to handle pressing matters or higher stress levels, you have to note that you are helping others come up with a solution regarding their accounts, but they may not always be pleasant. The management is right there with you when you struggle and help tone down hostile phone situations. Additionally, be willing to work different hours based on business need. The hardest part of the job was the commute and not always getting to help customers they way you hoped, because sometimes they just don't want your help.  The most enjoyable part of the job is your co-workers."
good,I did collections which was not really my favorite thing to do.  There is a lot of goals that must be met.  Benefits were very good however the pay was very low.
good,"There were always new things to learn at discover. 99% of the time it was an enjoyable place the other 1% is because it could be stressful depending on the day or the customer that your speaking to. I wouldn't mind going back, I love the work environment. and i loved how quickly the days would go by"
good,"Since becoming an independent company, Discover has been working to define it's culture. The company has made great advancements in diversity and inclusion (good or bad depending on your views/beliefs). Hiring standards seem to have dropped for entry level positions. If you work out of headquarters in Chicago, there are plenty of opportunities for career growth and advancement. If you work out of the operations centers, not so much. Slow growth rates, lots of turnover at lower levels, limited fields of work. Expenses are being actively monitored so there is a pretty heavy work load on every employee. Pay is lagging behind but benefits are generally good though rates have risen quite a bit this year. Work life balance is their main selling point."
good,"Working at  discover was interesting. "
good,Discover is a good place overall. Pay could be better and choice of management could be better   The benefits are good and paid time off is good but sick days would be helpful
good,"I came into Discover as a temp and they definitely had a way to let the ""temp"" agents know that we were not fully a Discover employee just yet! which kind of created a uncomfortable work environment for me."
good,"I enjoyed working there cause it worked great with my schedule and i was able to be with my family allot of the time. "
good,"I would prob still be with this company had the economy not had such a huge downfall the years I was there, "
good,"Too much partying going on, dress code is anything goes(did not care for that)  They rewarded you when things went well. I really did not care for this job."
good,This company is a great place to work. very secure and they take care of their employees. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for secure employment.
good,Awesome company to work for but the department of home equity loans for bankers had a very unhealthy competion.  My moral was being brought down for achieving goals and meeting goals
good,the place is a good place to work at. one of the reasons why i didnt like it was because the training was terrible. you sat at a computer 8 hours trying to figure out what you need to learn. the manegment is trerrible they dont really help you when need it. (at least mine sup was like that)
good,"While you are paid very well at Discover, the stress level can sometimes be overwhelming with the constant procedure changes and rotating management. While the management teams are very helpful, it can be a challenge when teams are forced to change, and a new manager oversees your work progess."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Discover, The environment was so much fun and they recognized your hard work, they were ready to advance your positions, once you should them you had toe abilities"
good,"It's a great mid-paying job for the work that I'm in. $15.25 an hour isn't bad. If call centers are your thing, this place is for you. Great staff, super nice management, great benefits, awesome and delicious cafeteria."
good,"Great company to work for with a few millennial snags experienced. Promoting because of political affiliation is too big of a driver but may have been addressed the last 4 years, 2015 to 2019."
good,"Great company to work for, fun atmosphere, help from managers. Generous commission program. Fast paced environment in the finance sector.  Collected on existing accounts and closed decided accounts."
good,As far as call centers go this was actually a good place to work.  The campus was beautiful and initially I felt like I was well compensated.  However after about nine months they changed the bonus structure and because of that pay was quite a bit less.
good,"Executed monthly attrition report for Protection Products membership, Credit Score Tracker, Payment Protection, Identity Theft Protection, and Wallet Protection."
good,"Discover has a very open and collaborative culture in general. People are willing to help. Management does live and breathe Discover values. For most part, work life balance is great. Company benefits have improved in the past few years."
good,"I worked in a single department for two years and really only had one option available to apply for in order to move out of that was the most probable. I do not feel the opportunity for growth into new departments was an easy thing to do, unless you're moving laterally."
good,A typical day at Discover will involve answering phone calls the entire day. Management is not the best and they do try to promote within the company. The culture is fun and they provide bonuses if you meet your goals for the month. The hardest part of the job is meeting monthly goals because that all depends on your persuasion skills to convince customers to apply and accept the loan you are offering them. Discover tries to make create a positive environment by keeping employees engaged and training them how to better interact with customers in order to meet the goals.
good,"I do like my company, however I feel like I am stuck at my current position.  The benefits are great and that is one of the main reasons I stay there, but I am currently bored and looking for more of a challenge and I feel like they don't have my best interest at heart when it comes to that."
good,Great place for people looking for work life balance. Good place for women employees. Execution oriented culture with emphasis on customer experience.
good,"The environment at discover is both young and professional. There are many days it can be fun but also many days it can be a drag. I would say one negative I have is all throughout my time there your feedback is welcomed but you are often times met with ""that's just the way it is"" and Discover will always adhere to its vibe of doing the right thing by the customers and treating the employees like they matter...untilllll the business results drop. Then they implement things that none of the employees like and disguise it by saying its to motivate everyone to do better when all it does is make great workers get discouraged and takes away peoples motivations because of the stress. Don't get me wrong though. Overall it is a great company to work for. Just don't like that feedback doesnt seem to matter a lot when its internal feedback."
good,"Discover is a great place to work  if you like a fast pace demanding job that values numbers ,conversion rates, performance. They monitor all your calls  and if you say something you are in trouble."
good,great place to start working if you're a young recent graduate and looking to get your start in a real world workplace. they also offer a competitive salary.
good,Discover is a wonderful company to work. The management cares about the employee . It helps to achieve higher education and also help in certifications
good,Everyone strives to become better at helping customers. Competitions are always in order and prizes are given. Employees and coworkers push each other to become better agents.
good,Discover has afforded me many opportunities over the years.  I've been able to work with a lot of fantastic employees and have learned many different process.
good,"Great non stressful environment. The people were great to work with"
good,Take phone calls to better assist customers with card and account related questions. Open dispute investigations. Work with computers and most up to date software.
good,"Very good place to work."
good,"I get in get on the phones to provided customer service.Not enough people in the team to do all the job we needed to do , stressful cut off times. process wire transfer request before 3 pm mountain time everyday, Manager was rude  and disrespectful. The hardest part is to met the goal after the cutoff. Love the free food they provide."
good,"It was a great place to work. The only thing I had an issue with is when there was a problem with a teammate our supervisor didn't take it seriously, and that ended up being the reason I had left."
good,decent job but not if you like to be active on your feet...there is a lot of desk time and sitting on the phone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
good,"The pay is decent and the benefits are excellent but doing the same thing all day every day is very difficult. There is recognition for the top performers, but it is more difficult to move up than purported."
good,A typical day at Discover Consisted of taking a multitude of inbound calls from customers who had questions about unauthorized charges on their Discover Card. I learned alot about fraud and how it is very easy for someone to steal your Identity. The hardest part of the job was to tell a customer that there was no way that I could personally assist them with the refunding of their money. The most enjoyable part of my job was that I was able to conversate and assist people all over the world.
good,"Discover card is a well growth in development company, i have learned that you can grow in so many departments and expand your learning with the company..."
good,"Loved the company culture and Co workers. Management disorganized, 10 hour days mandatory in collections, very cut throat money motivated. Work life balance difficult to achieve"
good,Chill job easy to do. Typical call center job good job if you dont mind sitting in a cubicle all day. Management is good and they care about their employees more than most employers
good,"The Company has a goal of work life balance.  The Company also strives for inclusion and diversity with several internal and external opportunities for training such as harassment, money laundering, and software used."
good,I would work with Discover again in the right position with a higher salary. I did try to promote within the company but I was offer another position making more money.
good,"This was a good started job into the industry. A lot of people start their careers there. Its a 100% on the phone job, so that is the hardest part. Lots of contests to motivate."
good,"This company offers some great benefits, most teams get work from home options one day per week. Really great vacation packages. Options for promotions and advancement are limited."
good,Just like any other call center. I like it for the people not the job. I work better if I work face to face with customer or team co workers. I like the phones and computer but more ineractive.
good,"Lots of office politics, position &  job advancement based mostly on who you know and not on qualifications. Scheduling is terrible! Too many nearly impossible stats to meet. Hard work and dedication go unrecognized for many. Leadership quality depends on what area of the company you work in. "
good,Cardmember Marketing was a tough place to work due to the personality of the Chief Marketing Officer.  Loved the culture overall but would never consider working there again unless there is a management change.
good,A typical day is an easy day.  Training is in depth and support is readily available.  Discover sponsors many activities that are fun.  You learn to be the best customer service rep at Discover.  Empathy and knowledge is key.  The hardest part of the job is the lack of compensation.
good,Very fast pace working environment. Sometimes the individual's task could be challenging. The company focuses on life/work balance.as well as promotes internal mobility.
good,"Discover was a very fun environment to work in, management was always helpful and ready to take calls if needed. Definately fun place to work, great for out of high school students looking to start a career"
good,This was a great job for a short time but it was just that a good job for a short time. it was a lot of work and a lot of training for a fairly simple job.
good,Discover was a great company to work for. I enjoyed my time here and was able to grow. They understand the importance of personal and professional growth as well as the importance of work life balance.
good,Basically they keep you where they see fit. Just getting your stats up is not enough to weigh in with the company needs that are clearly first.The skill set lerned here is useful everywhere. You can work almost anywhere once you have worked here
good,Good place to work if you are young and want to learn. Lots of company activities. Good communications. Good senior management.
good,"Discover is a Large burcracy that is too big for its own good. If you keep your nose clean and have no aspirations for honest work that effects peoples lives, this is the place."
good,"I loved working there, but, if you for any reason at all miss your stats at the end of the month, be prepared to be written up and formally warned, it only takes 3!"
good,"On an average day, I take about 100 Customer Service calls, where I handle the customers need while keeping track of my call handle time. I have learned how to handle a faster paced enviroment, as well as improved my customer care. My co-workers are like family and we all work together as one to make sure our customers are taken care of."
good,Just a typical day working in a call center environment. For the most part it was decent but the scheduling was one I did not necessarily agree with due to the work life and personal life was very imbalanced at best.
good,"Great place for work / life balance.  However, career advancement is limited.  Managers only value opinions that match their own.  Disagree at your own risk...it is not viewed well"
good,This is one of the best companies I have ever worked for. They truly respect and appreciate their employees and give recognition all the time. Which created a very positive atmosphere.
good,Team leads were always coming up with fun games or things to get you motivated in the work place. Everyone was always upbeat and having fun. Made it easy to be excited to come in each day. I learned how to get through call with accuracy and speed and quality. As a result in doing that I got many awards and lunches which pushed me to do better and train and pass on what I knew. Hardest part was to explain to someone why they were unable to get a credit card.
good,"Took inbound calls from customers regarding their Discover account. Moreover, processed payments on to Discover account as well as using purposeful questions to determine whether a charge is fraud or not."
good,"Productive and fun environment with a ping pong table, gym, and relaxation room.  Allows you to grow and aspire for more."
good,Nice Place to work if you are not in a support role. Good Benefits and vacation. Depending on the project flexibility to work remote.
good,There was a pretty high call volume which is typical. The days were still made pretty great by my management and co-workers. Everybody has a pretty friendly attitude.
good,A very difficult yet rewarding work environment. Management is very supportive. Pay and benefits are a nice bonus. There is a lot of room for improvement and growth.
good,Good pay. Management needs to not expect a part time worker to have the same production as a full time worker.
good,"No matter what location, Discover has offices throughout the country that anyone would be happy to work at, including its Chicago location which has a great walking path that you may notice deer from time to time. "
good,Discover had great benefits and a great working environment available for its employee's and took care of them. The job did however get a little stuffy sitting in one place the whole day and not only that but your metrics were constantly changing all the time making it very hard to keep up with what they wanted.
good,"Call Center, Speak with customers for 8 hrs a day about credit card information."
good,I worked there for 4 years in college. It was a good paying job and they really worked around my schedule.
good,"Fun productive and a enjoyable work place,providing great customer activations credit line increases web support change of address lost stolen reports calculating intrest explaining the reward program web support  relesing autherazations updating bank account information  answering 40 to 50 calls a day  duel monitors and the most enjoyable part of my job is making it easy and resolving my customer issues the hardest part of my job is when i cant resolve every cm issue Management is awesome providing constructive feed back and keeping us fully aware of any new changes and updates so that we are defect free"
good,"Self-managed, independent, innovative team looking into all aspects of the company. Performing test and studies in ways to make it perform at it's full potential. A great and multi-talented team that we get along more like a family in tackling every new challenge together."
good,"I was all customer service and sales, I was in high school when I started this job and continued when I joined the army. The army changed me as a person and getting yelled at in basic training by Drill Sergeants is one thing but getting yelled at by people that can't make a credit card payment is demeaning."
good,"I grew to be a leader in Discover and learned a lot from my peers. People here are nice and open, always willing to help each other."
good,Assisted all customers with their new accounts and giving them details on their account.
good,Will be at a desk working on computer managing accounts all day. Most enjoyable is the co workers.
good,A nice place for a 9-5 Job. Amazing work environment and a lot of new things to learn.
good,"Good place to work, supportive environment that works to do the right thing"
good,"Typical call center takes some getting use to, but overall they try to keep employees motivated with incentives of course."
good,It's a very fun job and your always busy and you learn a lot about financial stuff.
good,"A typical day includes answering customer inquiries on disputes they have with merchants. It also includes back office work to decision dispute cases and mailing out documentation and letters to customers notifying them of the outcome of the case.  I wouldn't necessarily say there is a hard part to the job.  It can be difficult when a case does not go in the customer's favor and they can get upset.  But it's all in the way you present it.  If you offer options on what they can do outside the dispute process to resolve, it can be a more productive conversation."
good,"Discover offered many benefits and was an excellent company.  I was in the call center which was connected to an automatic dialer.  It was one phone call after another."
good,"This position was a lot of fun and I advanced rather quickly, the co workers were the best part they were the ones I learned the most from."
good,Great company to work at because they offer work/life balance outside of the monthly close process.  They have a company gym and was able to stay healthy and fit during a hectic day.
good,Every day was challenging.  Every customer needed to be handled differently.  I learned better communication and negotiating skills
good,"Discover is consistently looking for ways to expand their business, diversify their portfolio, promote from within. An emphasis on diversity in the workplace is great. Ample opportunity to get promoted."
good,"Conducting interviews, sourcing talent, high volume recruiting, Full life cycle recruiting."
good,"Taking incoming calls, assisting customers with questions, activating customers cards."
good,Work with the ISA's.administering access to various applications. Set up new hires as well as completed terminations.
good,"A typical day at discover was, every day I received inbound and outbound calls. I had to negotiate with cardmembers to pay off debts Either get the cardmember to pay in full or set up a settlement with the cardmember. I worked in the charged off department. The hardest part of my job was co-workers trying to take your sale. Example we had to transfer our calls to the representative if they were their, but some co-workers wouldn't do that more just be honest. The enjoyable part is that I'm a people person I enjoy talking to people engaging into conversation so I enjoyed co-workers and being talking to others."
good,Its a company where u are appreciated for your efforts. the visiblity is high and fastly growing organization.
good,"Good place to work. However, advancement opportunities are limited.  Must be willing to relocate to headquarters outside of Chicago to advance. Remote working is available in certain situations. But not as available as they advertise."
good,I enjoy working at Discover. I wish there was more opportunities for advancement. I kind of feel like I’m as far as I can currently go in the company. Some of their raises do not make sense to me bc people below me that have been there for a lesser period are making just as much if not more than me. They start out at 4 weeks vacation which is amazing. Their health benefits are great.
good,"Given the basic breaks and lunches, however distance from eating areas and desks cuts the given time down dramatically."
good,"The pay is not the best, but they have an onsite clinic that is free to employees. Is a greet place to start out, but not make a career unless you are in management. It is great place to move around departments."
good,"If you go to the bathroom during your work time, that counts as part of your daily slush time. Same thing with coaching, making important notes about a customers account, etc."
good,"Somewhat stressful, they put a lot of pressure on you to basically be perfect. It’s ALWAYS your fault even when the customers are blatantly wrong and disrespectful you have to suck it up and accept being called out of your name. Team leaders are constantly on your case too, but they have a lot of fun events going on all the time which makes the job somewhat enjoyable. Takes a long time to promote but you will learn valuable customer service experience. Overall it’s not THAT bad but there’s definitely better out there."
good,"It was a good place to work at, my supervisor was great. Can't say the same for those above her. Promotions were given to those not best suited, which bothered more than just myself."
good,"It really depended on what department that you work for in Discover Financial Services. Some departments are better than others at promoting, strengthening employee skills, stress management, rewards and recognition, and overall quality of work/life balance. Other departments consist of high stress and low employee morale. Overall it depends on the manager and management style."
good,a day at DFS was busy and laid back depending on which team leader was there for the day. What I learned at DFS was the custom always comes first. the hardest part of the job was remembering the do and don't of a call when dealing with a customer and the most enjoyable part of the job was the tone and setting of the job the people I worked with were REALLY nice.
good,Great place to work and learn.  Employer is interested in creating a work environment that engages the employees opinion and skill set.  A very diversified company.
good,"I really liked working for Discover Card and they are a fantastic company, not every issue can be resolved and it turned out it just wasn't a good fit for me."
good,"a lot of Discover pride and great people.  Good benefits, good resources.  I was proud to work there because people really believed in the work and the products we carried."
good,"great starting job like out of highschool get experience, due to the company being so small here in AZ it is hard to move up into bigger better roles."
good,Listened to calls and streamlined processes. Identified areas of opportunity for better customer service experiences for customers. Gave constructive feedback to agents. Reviewed calls for proper call handling and procedures were followed properly.
good,Discover was great I couldn't complain until i had to have surgery then HR WAS NO HELP! my mangager changed 4 times in 3 months so management sucked..
good,good place to work if you aren't on the phones or take very little calls. pay is little compared to work they want you to do. Make promises to promote that they don't follow though with.
good,"My key role in the organization was assisting customers with questions they have about status and activity related to their account and Discover. I also process payments by telephone, ticket retrieval requests, billing inquiries, dispute initiation, and resolution, billing and credit bureau reporting. I have lending experience, can comprehend credit bureau reporting"
good,Management has a lot to be desired.  Politics play high at Discover unless you can find a true person that can be a fair boss and not a game player.  The benefits are awesome.  In my 23 years at Discover I had some wonderful bosses and just a few that were promoted with no experience that couldn't manage people.
good,Overall great place to work. Culture encourages collaboration and supports interest in learning the different business areas. Upward mobility is extremely limiting past manager and criteria for advancement is inconsistent.
good,"This is a good company to work for, if you get the correct management. The work/life balance is also good. The benefits are great, which is why I work here. All in all, a decent company as a whole."
good,Laid back employer. Fair compensation. Not much room for advancement if you are a hard worker. Will keep you in your spot because you are one of the few working hard.
good,"Its definitely full of cliques and a ""know the right people"" type of advancement . The management acts like they care about you until what you want to do no longer serves them. They aren't keen on the ""just come in and get my hours"" type."
good,"Discover will teach a person a lot about customer service. I have been able to take what I learned and use it at other jobs. I was there for over 11 years, so it must not be too bad. My daughter even worked there for a short time with me. I refer people to work there still."
good,"This job is easy to excel at and to be promoted. However, the upper management team is not the best and act like they don't care about you. The coworkers are the best part of the job."
good,Over all it is a great call center.  They are a friendly environment with open door management which I love.  The calls deal with peoples finances so it can be a little stressful because people are protective over their finances and credit history.
good,"Good company with great benefits. Some areas of company promote work/life balance. Others may not be so lenient. "
good,Every employee is super happy and excited about work and Discover orders lunch every so often and it is truly great. The negative is that you feel like your micro managed and can't even use the bathroom with needed unless it's in your break time.
good,"It was a good job, but i moved to asahi to get the benefits. "
good,"They use an outside HR for leaves and fmla, and after calling them 5 times and getting a different answer every time, my claim got denied because I was given the wrong info on the paperwork for my leave."
good,Discover takes great pride in it's collaborative and fun culture. Great place to work and promotes a good work-life balance. Friendly employees and innovative as well.
good,"I worked there for almost two years, it was a great place to work it teaches you about patience, having a great time with peers as well as the customers."
good,Love the environment and atmosphere and the people who work there are for the most part good people. However things were promised that did not meet my expectations such as advancement in the company or pay raises
good,Worked in a call center environment receiving in bound calls from existing card holders assisting them with frequently asked questions and serving their needs. Also made out  bound calls to preexisting card holders retaining their business and maintaining a great relationship with card member.
good,"A typical work day would be filled with meetings and problem solving. Working here taught me how diversity can play a major role in any company's success. Management is ethical and makes decision that are genuinely good in the favor of all employees. Met and made great friends among co-workers and learned a lot from them. Hardest part of my job to not get involved with the company initiatives; the openness policy attracts you to take part at every level. I enjoyed working with some of the best leaders in the industry."
good,I enjoyed working here while attending high school and after. I had one of the best supervisors I have every had. I was in charge of helping consumers do balance transfers.
good,"Many jobs that are comparable to this one offer better pay with other companies throughout the valley. Discover has a good culture and will allow you to advance quickly, however."
good,Great financial institution.  Offer growth not only for their customer but for their employees.
good,"I don't understand why you have to dress up for a job that requires no face to face time with cardmembers. Other than that, It was a great job. The only downside I really had was they seemed to value sales higher than providing great customer service."
good,"Discover is a nice place to work."
good,"Discover was a great place to work. Management was always helpful and uplifting. The hours were a bit rough. Sleeping hours were more during the day and by closing it was to late to really accomplish anything. Throughout the day there were constant phone calls coming into the center. It was my responsibility to answer general questions about card service, transactions, APR, or route calls to the appropriate department. My co-workers there were a great group of people to work with always made the days go by faster. They were the best part of working for Discover. The hardest part about the job was the customers. I have no problem helping angry customers, however, customers over the phone tend to be a lot more aggressive than in person."
good,Long commute from the city to the suburbs. Downtown office is open but not all departments allow their employees to work from there.
good,Good company to work for early in your career. Taught a lot about collections and customer service. Great benefits.
good,My typical day at work includes sitting in a cubicle all day answering back to back calls. Ive learned to be more patient with people and leaned a lot about credit. Management on the other hand is a hit or miss. The closest manager to you is your immediate supervisor which will be there for you at any given time but as far as their up above's such as the department managers are mostly really busy dealing with other stuff. The hardest part of the job would probably be sitting down with really high call volumes answering back to back and not being able to leave that spot. The most enjoyable part of my job would probably be getting to help people with their needs and making sure everything is relayed correctly.
good,I worked on both sides of the Loss Prevention business there- Cardmember and Merchants.
good,I learned how to set payment arrangements
good,"It's honestly so sad that I had to leave to feel free because all except for my immediate manager, I LOVED Discover but I found that my contract came to end and I was not interested in continuing. "
good,"I enjoyed working with Discover and was with them for two years. Due to a disability (which they were very flexible with previously) and very poor management, I lost my job and feel I am now unfairly barred from getting another job at the company. The convoluted process just to get my belongings back was very frustrating and inconvenient, not to mention having to wait at a gate on not being able to stop in as a normal visitor."
good,"The company recently redesigned their work spaces allowing for more open spaces. It is difficult at times to get things done with all the open office distractions. Upper leadership is passionate about a collaborative work environment, empowering the people who do the work and breaking down silos. However middle management is still struggling on weakening their iron fists. Frustrations will continue unless upper leadership gets serious about forcing middle management to change."
good,was a great experience overall but there are some things lacking in terms of employee moral and staying motivated. there were time you would want more than just to talk to clients because it does get tedious
good,A very number driven Company. Great benefits and it depends on who your lead is to become successful or not w the company. Communication is key but not here. Also everything changes all the time. Nothing stays the same. They value people who go on LOA than those who come to work everyday.
good,Like the people I worked with. They had a lot of fun activities and game also fed us a lot. I liked the upper management as they were very supportive.
good,I am not saying anything about this company.  I will not say positive or negative.  I am not that kind of person.  My views are totally different from others
good,"Discover offers benefits that are tough to beat. Great insurance options and generous PTO. Depending on the department, there are options to work remotely."
good,"Good company with good benefits. Tuition reimbursment, 401k matching, paid time off, health benefits. I would recommend getting a job here. Make sure to use your benefits!"
good,"Before transferring from Engaged Core to Engaged express, I was apart of a team that I loved. I was quick with my handling time to I was recommended to switch to Engaged Express. The Manager for my team was unprofessional, rude and made working at Discover very unpleasant."
good,Its a place of high competition and strict guidelines that must be followed. hold everyone to number status to must meet requirements or can be written up. culture varies between departments and management.
good,Good company that needs some improvements to follow its mission. Some disconnect between senior leadership and lower level teams end in projects not getting completed correctly
good,"Fast paced, diverse, training could be better to accelerate career advancement. Pay is good and work culture is adaptable. Flexible with life outside of work and family."
good,"Yes Discover is a great place to work, you meet some wonderful people, however it does get overwhelming and answering back to back calls and the scoring of the calls after giving it your best is very discouraging"
good,Discover Card as a whole cares about their workers so they do a lot within the company to motivate everyone. The people around such as your peers were very happy and helpful which made it enjoyable to be there everyday. I believe that they could work a little more with management as they seemed to lack a little bit of knowledge for what there job title was. Other then that it was a wonderful and beneficial place to work at.
good,Working here felt very supportive had lots of time off didn't feel like there was a lot of room for growth. I really like the culture there were so many fun events during work it felt like they did go out of their way to make you feel special
good,Discover personal loans isn’t A bad company to work for but working nights can be challenging at times. At the end of the day though assisting clients to their full potential is what is based on. From debt consolidation and personal loan use.
good,Discover allows for flexible work schedules and a good work life balance. Employees are allowed to work from home at least two days a week at the discretion of the manager.
good,"Discover is a very good place to work. If you don't have other responsibilities like family (as in children) or if you are never sick or anything like that, then you'd be perfect!"
good,"Good place to work"
good,"This job will teach one life skills that are essential for developing character needed for a career - time management, how to talk to people, how to manage people's frustration, confusion, and inquiries, how to efficiently take advantage of time, and how to effectively get the job done. This job is consistently time-consuming and brutal in the first few months of working, so take that into consideration when applying for this. I don't recommend this to high-school students who're involved outside of high school, college students taking more than 15 credits worth of classes, or those balancing another job because the training is consistently 29 hours of work a week and it's CRUCIAL to get all the knowledge and training in to ensure you're prepared for your job when you begin. If you're able to make it through you're in for a very involving job that has a competitive and lively atmosphere that consistently hold events to celebrate people's work. You'll be compared often to other people's work so you'll need thick skin and a humble attitude when going into this."
good,"very repetitive "
good,Good place to work .. but cant learn but management is not ready to adopt new things...... good benefits paid vacation nice workplace .......................
good,"Discover seemed to be all about appearances.  They did little things to try to make their employees feel appreciated.  However, they offered very little sense of ""family"" and some work standards were based on the individual supervisors interpretation."
good,"I did a few different departments while I was there over the 7 years. I was trying to promote to a coach or a supervisor. I did balance transfers, retention and customer service. I won several awards for top team and even top 5% performer of the entire company 3 different times."
good,"Discover is a great place to work if you can handle the stress load.  There is a lot to maintain at Discover, but it seems like there aren't quite enough employees to handle everything.  Lots of overtime yet lots of days off to use too."
good,"Assist employees w/ benefits questions and directing them to company site; administer New Employee Orientation. Overall, understand every phase of HR and what it takes to make the department a continued success. Conducted benefits fairs, management meeting, meetings w/ employees. Helped mgmt w/ job descriptions, postings and interviews. Conducted exit interviews for employees and interns. The most enjoyable part of the job was working w/ the employees."
good,The cafeteria is better than most area food options and the fitness center is the best I've ever used.  Culture can be kind of 'clickish'.  Transitioning from cubicles to open floor.
good,Management provides a comfortable and successful place to work.  It is an equal opportunity place of employment and treats its employees with respect.  There are many opportunities for self development.
good,"Was a very fun place to work, with great training programs/classes that helped people advance in their position greatly.  The young management could be inexperienced at times.  But overall, it was a very rewarding job."
good,"DFS is a pretty stressful company to work for. You have to help your managers meet their managers quotas to meet their managers quotas and so on... If you can handle the stress, and if you can sweet talk customers into paying off debt, you'll do well. If not, everyday will be torture. Awesome benefits, though!"
good,Discover is a great company to work for however call centers are not for me and they would not work with my schedule or help me move around the company to try something new
good,My time at Discover was very short but it was very fun. I definitely enjoyed my coworkers but I was definitely not thrilled with some of the decisions made by
good,Great company with great benefits.  Depending on position can be stressful and salaried employees can expect to regularly work more than 40 hours/week.
good,"Exactly what would be expected for a large bank.  A little more ""laid back"" atmosphere than some. Benefits are average. PTO above average."
good,Days at discover were spent on the phones 99% of the time. Management wasn't typical as they would encourage interacting with co-working to create a stronger team dynamic. They would create fun activities and exercises to keep an upbeat atmosphere within the department. The hardest part of the job would be having to probe customers for personal and financial information which can be difficult to discuss with a stranger over the phone. The best part of the job would be helping these same customers find the best solution to their situation.
good,"I absolutely hated my job, but I loved the company I worked for. "
good,There are challenges and opportunities for learning while contributing to the success of the company. The culture has a balance of different types of employees with an emphasis on youth.
good,My departments call types are extremely repetitive and scripted and it gets very old. The customers can also be very unintelligent and sometimes very rude. They listen to and grade your calls.
good,Typical day includes answering phone calls from people in regards to their account. Learned that people will try and take advantage of you or situations because they cannot meet their own financial obligations.
good,"Compensation is average among similar employers."
good,I would love to see Discover Bank retain quality agents by offering more competitive salaries and providing additional resources to help employees map out long term careers at Discover. Investing in existing agents for retention seems more efficient that continually hiring in droves in hopes that a few will stick.
good,some great managers in the time was with the company. as well great people to work with when I was with the company . no real cons as far the company goes .
good,"For a call center it was a good one, The company had special events and brought pizza in and tried to make it as fun as possible."
good,"Plenty of work at all times, our team worked well together.  Events the company held for us were fun. The company believed if the people were happy at the bottom and at all levels and up production would be better for all.  We were known for the best cross training and the pay was better than average for the industry.  Only con was the turn over with management and adjusting to the different management styles."
good,I was an intern at DFS where I worked as a data analyst. I had a great time with working with the team and also with the other interns. They have a really good internship program that exposes you to the real life work culture and they give you responsibilities that are usually given to a full time employee.
good,Discover is an ok company to work for. There is just not much opportunity for advancement.
good,"Good place to work, the management/company is always switching around policies you have to follow with little notice, the people there are awesome and have managers that work with you a lot and keep encouraging improvement and anything you need. Micro managed constantly though and the company switches around schedules and depts at will with little regard to reps needs."
good,High volume call center with very little opportunity to move up within the company. No new areas of growth for Delaware site.
good,A great place to work!! Has an onsite gym and health center. A starbucks coffee shack! Friendly staff and managers!
good,"•	Acclaimed recognition for substantial contribution for developing and implementing corporate flagship project in last quarter."
good,"DFS is definitely a fast-paced environment and offers a lot of opportunities for learning and growth. Working hours tend to be longer than other places."
good,"I liked Discover card, there was a lack of pay, & no job advancement."
good,"when i worked for the company previously i enjoyed getting to work early, worked with good people and great team leaders. plenty of motivation from the company with rewards. the hardest part of the job is learning how to help customers that are upset but it was good to learn how to communicate with the customers to help them with whatever situation. the best part of the job was the level of competitiveness to see who could get the farthest with the calls and work and to get the most up to date payments. "
good,Discover Finanical Services to me is a good place of employment. There are a lot of talented supervisors that are very willing to help with the development of the employment. I have really learned how to be muli-talent with handling the customers and handling inter office affairs. Woring at Discover is a good overall experience.
good,"A typical day at work was answering 60- 80 cvalls aday. I learned a lot about credit cards, intrest rates and the overall credit card business. Management was okay some time decieving. I enjoyed working with my coworkers. The hardest part of the job was to talk to customers who didnt want to talk to you. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting my goals."
good,Compensation could be better .And using an employee’s talent for their advancement could be more conveyed. Let an employee grow instead of making a department look good.
good,Discover provided a very competitive work environment. Working as a contractor was stressful because of the lack of communication with management about the status of the contract.
good,I really enjoyed the people and the fun atmosphere of discover. The collection position I was in was not for me. However I did struggle trying to move departments because my position was “where the company needed me”.
good,"It’s a great place to work, but definitely more of a younger crowd and favoritism. They do have amazing benefits, a cafeteria, clinic, and gym on site."
good,The job and benefits were great. I got burnt out from there being no movement. It was a bit disorganized with information and management as any call center is.
good,Great benefits and pay. The management was helpful in assessing where you are currently at and wanted to see us grow. Not much room for growth or advancement.
good,"Overall a nice company to work for. Need to promote more flexible or remote working.  Good employee benefit, but there is a strong demand for on-site childcare for the headquarter."
good,When I first started at Discover I was excited to go to work. It was a fun and collaborative corporate environment. Over the years it necessarily became more compliance-driven and less creative.
good,I found the corporate culture at odds with use of my talents. Unprofessional lower-level managers are allowed to create fiefdoms creating poor morale among employees. It's great if you're the right kind of person with a good manager.
good,I worked there for 2 1/2 years and tried many times to move up to a different department and was looked over. I finally left for more money. It was also very stressful in the Fraud Dept.
good,When I worked in customer service I generally like my job. It could be stressful at times but depending on your manager there could be a great support with your team. The same goes for any department. I just so happened to get a not so great boss in the accounting department which is ultimately why I left.
good,"Call center no stop volume "
good,"Great place to work. Good benefits, Company evolving with new technologies.  Increase opportunities for automation and learning new methodologies, process and technologies."
good,"As a company, Discover treated me very well.  The only problem was that I did not get paid enough.  The bonus structure was set so that it was next to impossible to receive bonuses.  The base pay is too low to maintain a living on a single income.  Discover is a good place to work for a second income."
good,Friendly work environment with ample vacation time. Sometimes hard to get job done due to meetings that could get solved via quick email or phone call.
good,"I worked in a call center environment on a team of 40 team members, a typical day was taking inbound calls regarding deceased accounts and making outbound calls regarding past due accounts.  The management staff were kind and helpful, always available to answer questions, the workplace culture was always positive, exciting, and positive.  The hardest part of the job was the negotiations with customers, the most enjoyable part was being able to help customers find solutions to their financial problems."
good,A typical day would have been pulling reports to see what wholesale accounts were receiving wires and process the wires.  This was a daily process.  On a weekly basis I booked brooked accounts and balanced with the finance department. The most enjoyable part of the job was the external customer contact and the internal contact as well.
good,Great place to work. Great staff. Internship taught me a great deal on the financial aspect of things. Worked in group project and had to present at the end.
good,"Discover was a great company to work for. The only issue I had with the company was that certain questions didn't have answers, meaning we would have to make up answers to tell the customer's."
good,Discover has a great culture and employees. They really care about taking care of the customer and provide opportunities to advance within the company.
good,"Discover was a good company, great benefits and decent work life balance.  Management could be better in my opinion, they pick and choose who they want to advance."
good,"Great place to work. Leveraging agile development and innovative with workspace, work/life balance, and provides opportunity to grow.  People and teams become family with lots of close collaboration."
good,"•	Collected Past due High Balance Accounts."
good,"This is a great company, lots of employee engagement, makes you feel welcome and always looks for employee feedback, input and seeking out if they are doing the right thing."
good,Great people work there and the upper level management is approachable.  Company is on the upswing.  Some people manager could use some help.  Overall more good than bad days.
good,"Discover is a great company that takes care of their employees, but the nature of some of the work can be difficult and exhausting to morale. The call center jobs have great incentive, if you are driven by added bonuses on to your regular paycheck, but you do get yelled at a lot by customers and it is a very competitive environment."
good,"Very easy to climb the political ladder. Very easy to earn bonuses if you are a competitive person, if no competitive then this is not the Company for you."
good,"Making collection calls all day is stressful.  Many card holders do not want to hear from a collection agent.  Discover did a fine job of making your job a little easier with several training opportunities, some obtainable goals and having an overall friendly supervisory team."
good,I worked in Merchant services area.  I assisted  merchants in their setting up the authorization machines.  I also trouble-shoot the machines. I could sent a field rep to assist if needed.
good,"Okay workplace, laid back wardrobe, free time during some shifts, multiple shifts are available, nice cafe but can only use discover credit card or cash"
good,While a customer service agent I had great managers. Went I went to an accounting department the management became horrible. Left due to poor manager.
good,This job is good but you definitely could get paid more for the same job but you risk losing the amazing way they treat their employees. I also only ever got 29 hours a week which also sucks.
good,"Huge rotation culture, generalists are valued over specialists, wonderfully customer centric. Flexible work from home policies and alternative office locations (Chicago city vs suburbs). Wants to be a leader in customer service, fast follower in technology."
good,"Discover Financial Services is an excellewnt employer if you are successful at and looking for employment in a call center. Unfortunately they manage their processing center as though it were a call center,  basing management staffing nt on management skills, but computer skills."
good,"Overall, a good place to work.  Opportunities given for employees to move up in the company, and I was able to do so.  They kept employees motivated and positive.  Benefits are very good and begin once you start employment."
good,This was one of my favorite places to work. I loved my job and the management staff was knowledgeable and friendly. Coworkers are some of the best people I've had the pleasure to be associated with. Everything was great until Discover home loans was bought by Guarateed Rate.
good,There is lots of friendly people there to help you when you need. There is opportunity for advancement. It's difficult to advance past the second step when in the collections department. Not all the top performers advance as easily as others.
good,"Discover is a great place to work providing a great culture to thrive in as you pursue your career goals."
good,Discover is a great company that takes care of their employees and offers a ton of incentives for doing a great job. Now sitting on a phone all day isn't the best but they allow and encourage the employees to make it fun. I remember playing catch with another employee while we both were on the phone helping a customer. I personally had an issue with being stuck in one area for 95% of my work day is the only reason I left.
good,Great culture and benefits with option to move around within the company and can learn different areas of the business  in order to grow our careers
good,Discover was a great place to work. I loved how they always make sure that their customer's come first. I have only worked in the customer support areas and I can say that the management was always very compassionate when it came to personal life concerns.
good,"I absolutley think Discover is a great place to work, it offers great pay, bonuses, amazing benefits, flexibility and a hundred other great things. Working in the collections department, I've learned that things can get very difficult and monotonous, and dull, but this is also where the money is at, I'm talking about 2-6K just in bonuses when you actually climb up the ladder and become a collector. When Discover hires you, they obviously start you out at the bottom of the totem pole, which in that position, means ONLY leaving messages to accounts that are past due. At first it sounds really easy and totally doable, but after a few months, you loose motivation after doing the same exact thing every day week after week, month after month. The worst part abut this position is that ironically, you don't get to speak to anyone on the phones, just leave messages, but you just have to keep ""hanging in there"" while they move you up in your position (typically about 4 months, unless there's a hire freeze, in which case you'll be stuck in one postion close to a year)."
good,"Discover is a good place to work. It is a call center that can give you many opportunities if you want them. Employee appreciation is okay, but the environment is great. The one big downfall is pay. The pay is not as high as other companies in the local area. If you are able to live on the salary this is great place to work."
good,Provided beneficial programs and handled complaint calls during financial hardships. Provided excellent customer service
good,"a typical day at work at Discover was taking inbound and outbound calls from customers, to verify information on their application with tools that were provided."
good,"Surprisingly, I really would. I loved my job, or maybe it was the shift pizza we would make. I don't know. I was able to meet some really cool people who I still talk to, to this day."
good,Discover was a well balanced company with a friendly energetic environment. It was a great part time job as well as a first learning experience in a call center.
good,"Great company and benefits. If Call center work is for you, Discover is a great place with many perks. Won JD Power for customer service. The paid training is very helpful and covers anything you will need to start the job. Many different departments in the call center to choose from."
good,"I had a good time while I worked here, I had a great team that worked hard and good together. Very good atmosphere with friends."
good,"My day a work is all about helping people to pay their bill with Discover. Although, I am met with some challenges on acquiring that goal I manage to get majority to pay. I get to ask about there struggles to see if maybe I can offer benefits or programs if they are unable to make their payments. The hardest part of my job is listening to the struggles that card members go thru and still having to ask them for a payment. The most enjoyable part is when we work thru their struggle and come to a compromise on a payment that fits their need."
good,"over all a great company to work for, however just like any other place, there are some bad apples in the bunch. sadly I have a team leader who is all power and does nothing to help her team advance or develop in their current position."
good,"Nice and calm, very laid back. Co workers were nice sometimes. typical day was alright. it would be better if the pay was higher for all the work that you do there."
good,"Great benefits, very productive place to grow your career."
good,Lots great people. Room for advancement.  Many different jobs available.
good,"Discover has a great environment in the sense that every team and every department I worked in my managers were always willing to work with me. They helped me with changing my schedule, with getting extra days off, getting time off the phones to focus on a project, etc. The hardest part for me personally is that it is extremely busy! If you like a Call Center environment then you'll do great. Overall great place to work"
good,Was a very professional environment with friendly co-workers.
good,"I would clear candidates backgrounds for employment with Discover Financial Services. I have learned HR requirements. My co-workers were great to work with. The hardest part of the job was clearing a candidates background that would not keep in contact with me through out the process.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the public, helping them through the background check and seeing their excitment when they got the job."
good,"A great company to get involved with genuine employees, worked in collections for a few years, but saw opportunities given based off popularity instead of merit"
good,Discover card has been a fantastic place to work. I have been there over 15 years and seen many changes. Some good some bad. But overall I've been happy there. To make a correction there is no more sales requirements. And customer service your job will be to provide superior customer service. To educate the cardmember to make sure they have a productive financial future with discover. Are primary goal Is to be the cardmembers card of choice. No more scripts being yourself providing shining customer service so surpass. Your cardmembers expectations.
good,"I enjoy working there.I have learned so much about the credit card, I learned how to use Microsoft Excel, as well as Microsoft Word. My co-workers are great people they really are suportive and I enjoy spending time with them at work."
good,* working directly with card member
good,"* Great benefits and employee perks. Insurance begins on day #1. Tuition reimbursement, benefits for significant other, etc. are great options."
good,At Discover Financial Services. They are very forward thinking company. They strive to try to keep their employees happy. I have learned to enhance my critical thinking skills. Management had its up's and down's. They try to do the best thing.
good,Excellent training and development opportunities. Great Benefits.
good,If you like to work in a team oriented atmosphere and are competitive and have excellent customer service skills than you will like discover.
good,"DFS is willing to give older workers a chance and reward productive employees. The culture in Columbus is not the same as in Phoenix, Phoenix is a bigger center and makes a huge effort to keep emloyees happy and interested."
good,"Discover is a great place to work. It allows you to be yourself and if you're motivated, you can move up as fast or as slow as you'd like. The culture is wonderful, great people to work for."
good,discover was good to work for the job just really wasn’t for me. if you can sit for hours on end and stare at a screen and say the same thing over and over this job is for you.
good,Great place to work with great benefits.  Lots of opportunities to advance your career.  Need to make sure you network to get higher promotions. Love the Parental Leave benefit!
good,the office I work at is a good work place.  The people that are here are all a good group of people.  The management team does it best to encourage and help with development
good,"Your hours are decent, the pay is good, they treat their employees honestly pretty well. But its a call center. No one can agree on the correct way to go about things on phone calls or who you should sent phone calls to in advancement. If you don't like talking to people and sitting down all day then the job isn't for you but if you can its not a bad choice."
good,"Discover cares about its employees and tries to cultivate a great culture. Lots of opportunity to advance and promote a lot from within."
good,This was a great intro job for me to have starting out of high school. Taught me a lot of applicable ways that credit affects you in ways that financial literally can't match.
good,"tasked with assessing and evaluating the risk of companies making financial loans proposals to retail and commercial customers."
good,"Discover is really great, but it is a call center. With that said I've worked a few call centers and this is by far my favorite. I only left because my family was moving. The pay is great and the benefits were amazing."
good,Hardest part was the commute from the city. Workplace culture was very open and honest. Very stressful during the month and quarter end processes but overall a great workplace.
good,Great place to work. Left because I felt I had no agency over my time there. Management is either great or terrible. The culture is second to none. Benefits are great.
good,"If you don’t mind call centers, then Discover is a great place to work. Many perks and benefits. I left after 11-1/2 years and have definitely considered going back."
good,Expectations were set out of reach and they stopped caring about employees as much as they once did. Call load was extreme and workforce did not schedule people appropriately.
good,"I haven’t worked for a lot of call center but discover is the reason I’m moving to another one. The job was actually fun if you enjoy pushing yourself to learn new skills in the customer service environment and have thick skin. The TLs is where it gets tricky, if you aren’t meeting in stats or had one bad call be prepared to be talked down to and treated like you are doing poorly at the job. If you can get good stats the whole month you’ll be left alone which is almost impossible. We described it as “Russian roulette” because you feel like you’re doing great and still get a bad score. Along with TLs lying about certain things to make sure you showed up or put for all the effort you have without being recognized. I recommend working here if you’ll go through the hiring process (most extensive daunting thing about the job) just pray you get a TL that actually is there to help you instead of just getting their bonus at the end of each month. Also, be prepared for a crazy schedule. I never worked the same hours in one week so I could never plan anything in advance and schedule changes are nonexistent."
good,"Productive place to work, multiple opportunities to celebrate employees, career focused and tuition focused, provides self care such as physical and mental health."
good,I didn’t work there for too long. But the few months I was there it was a fun place to work. Mostly if you got along with coworkers. I would go back..
good,"Nice place to work. Many career choices, but sometimes feels that your team leader has picked its favorites and only will help that person move forward, while stalling your advancement."
good,The beneifits Discover Financial services offers to employees day one is uncanny.  From the health care benefits to paying for college .  They have a lot to offer
good,"I held various admin roles during my 16 year tenure at DFS.  When I began my career back in 2000 it was a great place to work.  Excellent benefits and employee perks.  Very diverse culture.  However as the years went on and the lay-off's began, it turned into not a good place to be.  Anytime the layoff rumor mill surfaced, everyone had to watch themselves and their roles.  Some of the best employees, long term employees lost their jobs.  I decided to jump ship before my turn came and I feel I made the right decision."
good,You’ll never find a company that has a culture like discover. And they care about you. But the management is built upon empty promises of growth and passive coaching to get there.
good,Great chances to advance continually in short time period if you put the work in. Wish pay was a bit better but it’s livable at times. Co workers and others around are the best part of the company
good,Great company to work for. Some minor management problems. Great atmosphere would recommend for others to work here. Fast paced call center environment
good,This is a great place to work. Discover was a well balanced company with a friendly energetic environment. It was a great  job as well as a first learning experience in a call center.
good,Typical day at work included login in and taking inbound outbound calls pertaining to debit card fraud. It was over ten years ago and some of the details are hard to remember.
good,"The hardest part of working for Discover Card was realizing I did not get summers and a number of holidays off that I was accustom to getting off while teaching school. I only encountered one difficult employee that I had to interact with on a daily basis. My department manager was very aware of the situation and very helpful and supportive with dealing with her. My plan was to retire from Discover. Unfortunately my position was eliminated during a department reorganization. At the time, I was very disappointed. In hindsight, I was very thankful that Discover was there for me when I needed that security the most. I had been with Discover about 4 years when my husband was diagnosed with a brain tumor. He lived for a little over 2 1/2 years after the diagnosis. HR and my manager were extremely supportive and flexible with my schedule - insuring that I was never at work if I was needed at home, the hospital or taking him to the doctor's office. Between awesome insurance coverage and my flex spending account, we had no outstanding medical bills when he died."
good,Great place to work. The environment is super friendly. Plenty opportunities to develop your career and they even offer to send you to school completely free of charge. Just wished they paid more
good,Its a good bounce off point. You can stay if you want the environment is amazing. But it can be super stressful and not for everyone. I loved my time here at Discover.
good,Good place to work. Difficult to advance in departments and raises are sparse. But benefits are very good and vacation package is very nice as well as the 401k investment.
good,"I enjoyed my time with Discover, they are a good company and they show value in their employees with good morale boosters with incentives.  They also rewarded for good stats with food and time off the phones.  Overall I really enjoyed working for this company."
good,They have a lot of fun. Things to work for and prizes. But I will have to say the hours are hard if you have kids. First shift really hard to get. You have to be there for a long time and get on a waiting list.
good,"Good place to work. Had good friends at work. Work life balance was there. Compensation was good. Perks are better than any other company, I have worked so far."
good,"Good benefits"
good,"Loved the culture their the most ! Had great people around , atleast once you got to know who you worked with . Discover has a big great name so was always nice to let people know you work at Discover"
good,"Great company to work for, as I was able to take a leave-of-absence after my almost fatal car accident. Therefore, I was able to continue working after coming back from my Leave-of-absence. The departments are all very organized, and there is definitely opportunities for growth within the company.  However, the call volume was certainly too high in which I did not know my neighbors. Moving around the floor was a regular matter."
good,"Great place to work. Big campus, very nice cafeteria. Lots of events happening through out the year - although freelancers are not allowed to participate."
good,"I normally spend majority of my time scheduling meetings, answering emails, preparing presentations, expense reports booking travel and onboarding new hires."
good,"It’s a job I didn’t see it as a career cause they rarely advanced people, felt stuck and burnt out and you were way overworked with the little pay they gave you."
good,Fun place to work. Wish they had more career advancement channels. I would recommend this to others as a good place to work. Good work life balance and benefits as well.
good,"I enjoyed my co-workers and the managers. Discover has high standards, so you must work hard. They have good incentives and you can move up within their company."
good,"They fired me for not meeting my productivity for two months in a six month period. I know of one person on the team that only met it two times in a six month period and another person that met it three times in a six month period, those two people had not been fired."
good,it was a great place to work. helped me grow. I loved how my supervisor encouraged me. We always had team building activities. I believe it really led me in the place that i am today.
good,"its a good job with good benefits. it is just getting hard taking back to back phone calls. i have been promoted and advance to a position that was more relaxing only to have my position discontinued and now being placed back in an old role, that is back to back calls again. I did not work this hard to get where i am to basically be demoted. it is rather discouraging. they are letting us keep our pay and shifts but it is just so tiring. love the people i work with and they are striving to maintain competitive pay, but just not quickly enough for me to have the incentive to stay there."
good,very busy and stuck to a chair very hand on always learning new things and wanting you to advance yourself as much as you can they really invest in their employees
good,"I worked for DFS for one year. It had a good culture and my supervisor was very helpful. It had benefits and incentives. I was also paid commission and had 20 PTO days not including holidays. The only thing I didn't like was the job itself. I am not a fan of call centers. Other than that, it was a good place to work."
good,The hardest part of my job is satisfying the direct manager who is micro management.  I'm a hard work and team player will to assist anyone on the team.  I'm flexible and dependable to get a project done.
good,"Discover financial services is overall a good company to work for, they offer many benefits and PTO, the only thing I would say is a down side would be taking around 115-140 calls back to back in an 8 hour shift. More time off the phones to get computer work done would have been more reasonable."
good,It was a pleasure to work at Discover. For the size of the company there was a lot of room to grow and overall a good management team. Majority of coworkers were enjoyable to work with.
good,"Assignments based on experience with planned room to learn and grow. Management expects much from themselves and you. Hardest part of the job is remaining focused on assignments, always a squirrel you can fix that runs past you. Best part of Discover will be your coworkers - great people."
good,"Working at Discover was a great environment and great people to be part of a team, however it can get very stressful and it can be a very hard job at times. The management was great (for the most part) at helping with problems or any questions. The culture was fantastic and never ceased to amaze anybody. I would say the hardest part would be taking phone call after phone call without a break."
good,"No complaints. Pleasant people. Most supervisors are good people and competent and I was lucky to have had good ones while there. It's sometimes hard to maintain connection  with co-workers when they have to move people around alot, but that's just to make sure that arrangements fit business needs, so that's not really a complaint, just an observation.. Co-workers are nice folks, too busy for too much soap opera in the workplace, anyway, which is much healthier for the psychological/emotional environment there."
good,"My 1st Career job, loved working there and enjoyed my coworkers.  I was laid off with a large group during the recession, otherwise I would still be there."
good,"Was hired as a 2 year fixed term employee to assist in the design, coding and testing of components of a  new sub system built to extract data from a Legacy IBM main frame based student loan servicing system for migration to a state-of-the-art banking platform."
good,"I loved working for Discover Card. The training was great and very helpful. They always made things fun. Unfortunately due to life situations, I no longer work there. I wish I did! I always refer people to apply there. Great company!"
good,I worked as CSE for Discover. That's a front-line position that can be very busy and you're dealing with a lot of different personalities. I had a great team that made the job much more manageable. Discover overall is a great company to work for. They do care about their employees and want to make it a good work environment.
good,"Mangers and the employees are really good.."
good,"GREAT company! The people you work with are pretty cool. Benefits are great pay could be better. Once hired was under the assumption you would only work two weekends a month that is NOT the truth some times EVERY weekend. Work/Life balance is kind of hard to manage because everything is based on ""business needs"" so if you adjust your schedule or request an adjustment its very likely you won't be accommodated. 30 minute lunches and two 15 minute breaks. A lot of food days and activities as well as you are recognized for your hard work daily with dinners etc."
good,"Discover has an amazing environment that is focused around bettering the employees at communication. Through 2 years, I have learned how to better communicate with people in a way they can understand and I have learned the value of enthusiasm. They (Discover and Employees of Discover) carry a pride for how they work and it is well deserved. As a company they are not focused on earning money from people as they are to help. This was my first job and it is a valuable one as it helped bring out the outgoing nature in me and helpes me become more confident in the ability I have to solve problems and come up with multiple ways around a situation."
good,The people at Discover were great. I took a job within collections knowing that my existing skill set was not the greatest for the position. Discover was patient with me and helped me develop the skills needed to thrive in the collections industry.
good,"Discover had one of the best work environments, lots of happy employees. Needed more structure, too many changes in such short periods of time. Would recommend to others."
good,"Discover was my first job after finishing my Associates Degree. I had warehouse management experience but had never worked in a professional environment. Discover offers positions from entry level customer service, all the way up to executive management. With hard work, I was able to advance fairly quickly within the organization. The great thing is you have so many options when it comes to job roles. Compensation is ok when compared to competitors. However, the work environment makes up for that. While Discover is a large Fortune 500 company, it has a small company feel. It is not uncommon for several Vice Presidents to know your name, and details about you. There are opportunities to relocate if your willing to take the plunge and uproot."
good,"Depending on what team you work on, you may struggle with work/life balance.  Discover runs a very lean staff and expects an ungodly amount of work to be completed (projects, etc..) while you can barely get done your daily duties."
good,Discover  just need to go back throughout their supervisors and managers and do some house cleaning. But the company as a whole is awesome.
good,"The company overall is an excellent place to begin your career, develop skillsets and learn about the Financial Services sector. There are many wonderful people within this company, especially within the Finance/Accounting/Treasury departments. The work-life balance is second to none. Very flexible and accommodating while offering exposure to many avenues of the business field."
good,I love working for Discover and the opportunities it has given me to advance in the financial world is outstanding
good,"Fun and comfortable work environment. Flexible shift options are available because the company is open 24/7. Management is friendly and knowledgeable, overall the work is easy but often stressful. "
good,Discover really values its employees and they have a great culture that values work/life balance and employee development.
good,"Depending what department you go to, you'll have a lotted time to get clocked in, and bring up all the systems you'll need on a typical day."
good,Discover has an amazing culture to it. I would recommend this job to people going to school. I work on the banking side of discover and it is a lot different the credit card.
good,It is easy to advance when you know the right people and flaunt skills. The best part is working with a team that you will love.
good,"A typical day as an account manager consists of an 8-hour work day assisting card members via phone with account inquiries or concerns. Some days may consist of team leader ran calibrations to review team goals, achievements, call-listening, and planning for future goals."
good,"The environment was high energy and very demanding.  As a consultant you were not engaged with immediate management until the status meetings, in which it seemed there was always an issue that needed more attention.  Many of the applications were home grown and required root cause solutions to fix the environment not the individual instance.  Getting approval to fix the root cause was difficult, thus metrics got skewed."
good,"I have learned a lot about team work and providing great customer service. "
good,My typical day was receiving one call after another activating customers credit cards. I did enjoy it because i love working with computers and love office jobs.
good,"I currently work in a call center environment where I use my analytical skills to assist customer account needs such as payments, fee adjustment, credit line increases, cash advances, balance transfers, etc. and cross-sell loan products."
good,"It has great benefits.  Great place to start a career.  To advance you need the right connections.  Only get paid so much.  The culture is good, but it is all about who you know"
good,Hardest part of job was not having a hands on job and just answering phones. Learned people skills
good,Worked on the phones helping cardholders with information on their credit card accounts
good,"Great for a full time job with decent pay, but nothing I would want to make a career out of. However, I'm personally just not apt for sales or collections unless necessary. There is plenty of incentive for motivation."
good,Great place to work and great advancement opportunities as you grow in your career.  Earning potential is good.
good,"Great culture, with opportunity to advance. Management is fair, wonderful place to work!"
good,"The ability to judgmentally decision the approval of a loan based on system determined risk factors and the ability to question the reasoning for the requested amount of a loan based on the ability to view the customers credit portfolio is a wonderful opportunity with Discover Financial Services. The compensation for doing so, though it is improving, is very poor and the time it takes to change this feature in such a large company, takes months and maybe even years."
good,"Discover is a good company to work, has a great work life balance and also has great values. I have learnt a lot in Discover about the company as well as the industry"
good,"Overall, Discover is a great place to work. I enjoy the collaborative environment and ability to be creative."
good,Good place to work while I was there but customer service is very cutthroat and have no problem replacing if you don't perform well.
good,"My manager was like my best friend, and my co-workers were like extensions of her. The sales quota was hard, at first, but then I was in the top sales for 4 months in a row. I enjoyed seeing my name have more and more stars next to it, as I got more and more sales."
good,"I worked in collections. I answered the phone when customers were calling back to make arrangements or explain their situation. I would push for promise to pay, payments. I would follow up as needed. I met goals each month. I learned at that time about all the tough times that are out in the world. My coworkers were suportive and competative. The hardest part of the job is when you tried so hard to get a payment and they really could not do it do to a bad situation. The most enjoyable part of the job was the competition we'd have as coworkers about our goals as well as other tactics we could come up with like legit ideas in which the customer could go do to make extra money to pay their bill."
good,"Discover Financial Services, is one of the best companies ive worked for. Great schedule, friendly people, amazing values. i worked in the customer service department, and the only downside to that was the PUSH to sell a product. on every call, we had to push push and push to get a sale. i enjoyed talking to the customers,but that enjoyment was cut short by the constant reminder to sell something to them. Discover card cares a lot about its employees, and how well their lives are balanced.from providing excellent health insurance options, to an indoor fully equipped gym."
good,"Large company, good values, HQ has lots of great amenities and employee perks. Great benefits and good work/life balance."
good,"Opened and serviced business card accounts. Learned that business clients are much different than personal clients in many cases, since business clients know more about the product and are more professional. Management was very supportive, co-workers were engaging. The hardest part of the job was the sales aspect on the personal card calls. The most enjoyable part was dealing with the business clients."
good,It's a great company to work for if you want to move around but management was horrible and unprofessional
good,They are all very positive and they always have something going on for their employees. They provide a lot of resources for inside on the job and also for the outside world.
good,They are very flexible and supportive of work life balance. The benefits are affordable and with work life balance is wonderful. The leadership supports staff
good,"My experience at Discover was positive, teams and agile transformation office were good to work with.  And Chicago is an incredible town; love Chicago!"
good,"only issue was conflict of scheduling, other than that it was a good place to work. maybe in the future I will will return. Not to much more to say about customer service."
good,Discover has an incredibly active and diverse campus situated just outside of Chicago. They are very willing to work with new employees to help acclimate them to life at Discover
good,They want you to be yourself and nothing more. Everyone is so nice and happy great hours. Everyone get a pick of the crop with hours and you learn all departments. It’s not just about the customers they also care about you.
good,Good Good. Its pretty good work culture . Its pretty good work life balance. Its pretty good pay structure . Its pretty good positive work environment.Its pretty good work culture
good,"Discover has given me the opportunity to work at home, I have also had the chance for career advancement with mentoring and working in the Fraud department."
good,"it was a opportunity to work in such kind of reputed company and excited to work always in such kind of atmosphere."
good,"I have enjoyed working at Discover and it has taught me more than enough customer service skills to last a life time. It pays well and training is thorough, but there are always leaders around to assist. Call Centers are not for everyone, but it is a decent place to work."
good,enjoyed working at discover. Hire quality people and work with you on your job to make sure you are doing a good job. Hired for back office rep during summer. Enjoyed working there.
good,"I worked in the call center in New Albany. The atmosphere is positive and they treat their employees well. You have the opportunity to move up quickly as long as you want to stay on the phone. If you want to move to a supervisor role, it is much harder and office politics begins to take a bigger role."
good,Excellent Work Life Balance. Company was focused on employee welfare when it came to work life balance. Also good internal movement and opportunity for advancement.
good,This company by far took the most interest in employee development and is where I learned the most relevant skills that helped me be a better employee in general.
good,"Hours were good for me at the time.  Good balance of patrol and desk time.  Most, if not all, employees were gone between 5pm and 6pm.  Co-workers were great to work with."
good,"discover is a really chill place to work and the environment is amazing. everyone is usually pretty laid back, the only issue i ever had is that since there are so many other workers it's a bit hard to get promoted and management is usually so busy they feel just a little distant, but honestly it's when of the best places i've worked."
good,"I worked for Discover about five years ago, so things have probably change. "
good,"Discover Financial Services is a wonderful place to work, especially if you're the social type. Everyone that was at Discover was very kind and they were great to work with, but the overall environment was a little bit draining in my case. The typical day at Discover is in short sitting and taking customer calls. The benefit of working here is they train you to be the best you can be at providing the perfect customer service, and the people that train you are some of the best I've had the chance to meet. The hardest part of Discover is checking every box; working at Discover your calls will be scored by a team and getting a perfect 10 is very very difficult. On a better note Discover does have many benefits including but not limited to: 401k account, many options, free merchandise, and the people you'll meet working here."
good,"Great Employer. Very responsible corporate citizen. Very supportive managers who seek employee personal development. Overall, it is a great place to work."
good,I worked the graveyard shift so the first couple hours were super busy but middle of the night was off and on. Once you get a specialty such as web support it helps ease the pace. Lots of recognition if you do good work which is nice.
good,This was over 10 years ago so I can not speak on Discover. Then it was a great Corporation to work for. Great compensation and benefits. Great location.
good,Very flexible working environment. Company's leaders have clear vision of where the company should go. Discover is a company that offers a lot of employee training opportunities.
good,"Great place to work with many opportunities for development, growth and advancement. Agent and management training are superior and second to none.Reports and Improvement Plans aid in managing teams and resources,"
good,"Complete agile environment, management has a good relationship with devs, balancing work and personal life is easier, you would face pressure before releasing from management just like any other company, but overall it's a good place to work"
good,I enjoyed my time at discover. It was very hard to meet all expectations but the training was good and once you learn the details it wasn't so hard. breaks were very regulated.
good,"Discover offers many benefits compared to other employers including maternity/paternity pay, excellent 401k match, paid time off for salaried employees starts at 25 days, nurse practitioner on site, and everyone comes off very friendly. Depending on your department and role determines your stress level. The company just increased the starting hourly wage to 15.25/hr which was huge."
good,"Discover gives a wide range of insurance benefits and provides a bucket of days off to be used at the employees discretion (sick, vacation, family...)"
good,"Multiple locations to work from- home, city, suburbs. Facilities are well maintained. Environment is safe, clean and friendly. New CEO making changes in personnel, procedures, etc. so time will tell if those changes are beneficial or not."
good,great pay and benefits. worked from home. i loved working for them. i started off full time and ended in part time. they worked with me as long as they could while i had a lot going on in my person life.
good,"I really like working for Discover, alot of diversity is always a good thing, Discover has received the JD Power Reward twice since  I have been working there, the gave all employees an extra paid day off for that , its  actually a great place to work."
good,"The culture us unlike anything else, they truly care about their employees! Ive never felt so open and honest with Management in my life! The love and passion is something that radiates at Discover"
good,"Discover is a great place to work, collaboration is valued and so is innovation and continuous improvement.  Even though great strides have been made in gender equality and inclusion there is additional work to be done."
good,"Great place to work. The training is extensive and team leaders are very helpful. They are energetic, helpful and overall just a great place to work. Thanks"
good,I worked for Discover for three years and I was able to work my way up from a front line agent up to an analyst with in three years. I was a very happy employee while working at discover the company does really take care of it's employees.
good,I liked working at DiscoverCard. I was there 8 years but had to leave due to black mold in the building. I would probably still be there if that didn't occur.
good,"This company has great Medical Dental Vision benefits."
good,"Took both inbound and outbound calls.  Explained fraud process to cardmembers and asked for additional information relating to the fraud process.  Worked in fraud department for approximately 4 years.  Prior to that worked in customer service from 1999 to 2013.  Answered cardmembers questions, regarding billing, finance charges, sold company's products, various other questions relating to their accounts."
good,"Discover decided to jump into the mortgage industry and purchased Lending tree, previously home loan center.  The culture was already developed and the talent was already present.  While things were running it was a great place to be."
good,I have nothing  negative things to say about the Discover company and the work environment that I deal with on a day to day basis that impacts my position
good,"management was very helpful, typical day involved placing and receiving phone calls from card members answering questions and give quality customer service, diverse culture fun,"
good,Discover is a great place to work but very limited Advancement opportunities. They also Don't have many opportunities to change shifts. they only have evenings Available for Customer service.
good,Learn lots of skills at a great starting pay. However after being there for 3 years people who have been here less than a year received higher raises and they were making close to what i was as well. With all the stress of the work from my specific department i just felt like i could earn more with the experience i have.
good,"Discover is a fun cultured, focused company with diversity and inclusion at the forefront of the company values. They are often very developmentally focused and willing to help with employees' schooling costs."
good,"Paid Time Off (4 to 5 Weeks of paid time per year)"
good,Fun place to work with plenty of opportunities for advancement. Great work life balance. Plenty of career development opportunities.  Beautiful campuses ; working remotely is an option in many cases
good,"Discover was a good company to work for. They treat their customers well, and the diversity was good. We had a lot of time to go over with our coaches, listen to what we did wrong, and got the help we needed."
good,"The first thing to say about working at Discover Financial Services is that these are some of the nicest people that I have ever worked with."
good,Great place to work.  They do incentives for employees to perform higher.  Be ready to keep yourself busy most of the day.  There is someone always willing to help if you have a question
good,Motivating place to work.  Fulfulling work day with plenty of challenges and excellent team building exercises.   The mentorship is very strong and plenty of lasting friendships have been made
good,The culture was great at Discover Financial. Everyone was really friendly and eager to help you. There was plenty of opportunities available t advance within the company.

good,great environment great pay great people great hours i made high volume calls (outbound).they people good people for leadership my department was very understanding
good,Discover card has a vast variety of teams you could belong to.   But it all came down to credit card customer service call center.  It was a fast paced job with stress at times.
good,Discover is a great place to work. They provide tremendous opportunities to develop and grow. They make a substantial investment in the professional development of their employees. They provide excellent benefits and assist with tuition reimbursement.
good,Contact customers about past due credit card accounts. I learned different regulations for contacting customers. I learned how to ask open ended questions to get better information and understanding for situations. The hardest part about the job was convincing customers that is is beneficial for them to pay debts that were owed. The most enjoyable part was the workplace environment.
good,Very happy there. Enjoyed my team and management team.would work there if  the opportunity arises. My manager was very supportive and provided extensive training and materials to assist with our daily work responsibilities.
good,The company has great potential to grow and promote.  They have amazing benefits and a very thorough training course. They promote within and that's great!
good,"Great place to work, even greater people to work with.  Great atmosphere and beautiful campus to work on. Nothing not to like about working at Discover Card."
good,"Best dept. Is Customer Service, Other departments are more stressful. But they have something called Edoc that ive never had at any other job, but if are running late or have to call off the day of your shift, you can call the hotline and they check the call volume and they can excuse you time off or to leave early."
good,I liked where I worked and my manager was the best. I would love to go back and work for them I was from a temp agency so I got laid off. But would want to got back
good,Nice break rooms and potlucks. They do reward you when you win against other credit card companies. lunches catered etc. nice working atmosphere. No bad treatment a fair workplace. Fun place to work
good,My only issue with working at Discover was the fact that I was in collections. I was told I had to stay in that department for at least a year before I was able to transfer departments. I was good at it and I was at the top of my class in training but I didn't feel comfortable being on an automatic dialer and dealing with angry customers.
good,"This is a a great place of employment I would recommend working here. Everyone is very friendly and excited, the management is amazing and is always willing to work with you and improve not only you but themselves to be better. The hardest part of the job is being able to handle a angry cardmember and diffuse the situation."
good,"Answer basic questions about student loans and offer options on how to apply."
good,"Discover was a good call center to work for. They are very structured, and make sure that you have all the tools you need to succeed with them and their needs. Overall, a good call center to work for."
good,"Great company, great culture, great growth opportunities and friendly people. PTO is generous but other than that nothing special.  No work life balance if you are in a tough team..."
good,"Working at this call center, you can be easily replaced and you can take up to 130 calls a day. You can burn out easy but everyone that you work with is amazing. Forget about your social life though. For a while, you're just gonna be tired and want to sit in silence or have music on all the time. the pay is great, but sometimes it's not worth it."
good,"Very good comp, benefits, work / life balance. I would highly recommend to anyone interested in having a career in banking .Wonderful company, management and teams. Facilities are great and there is nothing one would want while working at any of the various locations across the US."
good,"It was great working with employee friendly company like Discover Financial Services."
good,This was a great place to work that provided lots of places to grow and advance your career. They are all very thoughtful and always looking for a way to help you move into a greater role in the company

good,"great benefits, good place to work,  free lunches once in awhile , pto of 20 days to start, benefits start at day one, onsite cafeteria, management is good to work with"
good,"Discover is a great place to work whether part time or full, whether you just want a job to provide money while you're in school, or want to advance with the company.  They pay your tuition on classes that relate to their business, and lots of classes qualify.   The hardest part of the job is sitting for long periods.  The best part of the job is all the people you get to make friends with, the great management teams and the nice celebrations they give."
good,"Discover Card is a fast paced environment,, even though you could get commission it was really easy to lose it. Offered time off but it had a cap and hours not used expired."

good,Discover values their employees hard work. Management really does like hearing from its employees. I have learned more about credit and the importance of good credit since working here.
good,"It's a great place to work. Generally speaking, management is fantastic and very motivated to help you progress your career within the company. Team building and interaction is one of the primary parts upon which the entire experience is built. The pros do outweigh the cons, but unless you're able to handle high call volumes (calls back to back ~95% of the time) and the occasional disgruntled/angry customer you won't be able to succeed at this company. Your schedule can also make you lose interest in the job quickly as it can vary depending on company needs."
good,"For a young person just beginning their career and having the drive to advance in a reputable company, Discover is a good place to be. Discover has a very diverse population of employees."
good,"I this is sowmya from capgemini"
good,"Great pay, but can be stressful. The week day schedule is nice, but weekends scheduling suck because they don't give you your normal schedule often and you work darn near every weekend"

good,"great place to work, great managers and supervisors. lots of things going on around the work place to keep the employees happy. would recommend to anyone"
good,It offers a lot of perks and they make coming to work fun. Great people to work with and very fun teams. Open door policy is great. Continually trying to make the employees happy to come to work.
good,"Balance transfers was awesome because in between calls I had time to talk to my team and get to know them. But after promoting into customer service for the discover it card, I had no time to get to know my team, and I think my team suffered because we barely communicated."
good,I am eager to contribute my enthusiasm and skills to the organization and grow in this position and I guarantee that my work exceeded the expectations. I greatly appreciate the opportunity to work the with and learnt from the talented team.
good,Very fast paced at all times. All calls are to the point and a very high volume. There are many tasks to cover with many different types of callers. the most important thing is to follow up with all things and document everything.
good,"I worked in 2 different departments... with 2 vastly different cultures, one was much more laid back, and the other was like a college. Depending on where you go you will get a different experience. Management would be the first to tell you they can't match other companies compensation, but the have excellent benefits."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Discover Card, work is stressful at times and can be very fast paced back to back calls, with no to little break between calls. Discover offered great benefits to its employees, and the management was also well trained, I would recommend to others."

good,My time with Discover Card was pleasant.  Upper management was resourceful and attentive and always pushing you to do more.  Would recommend this job to people who are attending school due to their flexible hours.
good,"In a customer service, call center environment, finding motivation and happy employees is sometimes difficult. Not at Discover. They go to great lengths to ensure employees have proper motivation to do their jobs, as well as providing them with the skills to boot. Practice what you preach is a good motto for this company and they treat their employees very well."
good,"Good work environment, good benefits. Nice learning curve for someone new to credit and how to improve yours.  Onsite gym, and cafeteria, friendly team competition."
good,Discover card was a fun place that gave a lot of motivation for the job. Collections isn't easy by all means but you are in an environment that can make it exciting.
good,Discover is not your typical credit card employee. They do everything they can to stand behind their employees and make them happy and comfortable making the environment a happy and healthy setting .
good,"A solid financial services company with room for advancement. Discover management has changed since I was there, so no comment. It is an international company, so there are many opportunities"
good,"Great place to work while I was there.  Fosters employee recognition, great health benefits and excellent guidance by management.  Managers treated their employees with respect."
good,"The things I loved about working at Discover was helping the customers and helping my co-workers.  I would take anywhere from 60 to150 calls a day, depending on how busy we were.  I would help with payments, reading their statement, figuring out why their card wouldn't work or why their balance was different than they expected.  Discover has said the only thing constant is change.  It was important to keep up on emails and company news and updates.  They had great benefits."
good,"Discover was a great place to work, it provided all the needed training in a classroom environment. It was a great place to work, schedules were flexible and the people were very nice! It was great when customers called in and got the help they needed. Having team meetings to go over how the team felt, and being able to express concerns was a definite plus."
good,"The majority of my time was in the technology organization.  I loved it there, though felt I needed a challenge, so I moved to the business organization.  These area's are very different and very competitive."
good,"i managed a small team of ops and finance. it was challenging as i was new to this type of role. (got the role through an internal promotion.). it was outside my core competence. however i managed to work things out."
good,"Discover can feel like all work but upper management does a consistent job of providing workers with small treats such as snacks, drinks, and small prizes."
good,"Discover was very good at recognizing achievements and very good at recognizing weakness and trying to fix them. They were very kind and treat employees with respect. Though it is often times about the customer, it felt like the company was just as invested in you."
good,I enjoyed working at Discover. The morale there was amazing. There is room for advancement which is beneficial but you definitely have to meet certain metrics to qualify. Not always attainable.
good,Great environment with great people! loved working there and enjoyed customer service. Also was in Sales and the money as great if you hit your goals and stayed on your badge timer.
good,"Surprising ""family-feel"" given the size of the company.  Not your typical bank/financial services giant.  Relaxed environment (every day is jeans day!) and beautiful corporate campus."
good,"You spend pretty much all of your time on phones, which can get overwhelming after awhile. The people their are very friendly and helpful make the work environment a good time you have plenty of pot lucks, and they do a lot of recognition."
good,"Made outgoing calls to card-holders that are delinquent on their to obtain full balance owed, set-up payment arrangements or settle to avoid account going to collections."
good,"Hours and shifts that were available and very fair, had plenty of time off and the overall management were fun, knowledgeable and were more than wiling to always offer assistance"
good,We can learn more in cognizant. It's good to work there. Learning culture in cognizant is very helpful for us to develop ourself. I was working on Web service testing. Cognizant helps the associates to learn more new tools and helps us to shine.

good,This is a fairly smaller company however you   have great opportunity to grown.  most  manager treat their employees  well. this company base their core value  on doing the right thing.
good,"collection.. so I collect money om past due accounts , work on two different computers at the same time , multiple screens"
good,There are weekly and monthly incentives for the teams as well as the individuals.  We also have a Pot Luck once a month to keep team members involved with each other. We have weekly team meetings to go over stats and talk about what we can do to improve them and also to have some time off of the phones to talk to our leaders.
good,"Summary: Reviewing transactions, product services, and billing inquiries to nurture customer relationships on every interaction. Assisting clients with credit updates and credit adjustment. Take payments from card members."
good,Discover is a great company that had many opportunities for growth in all departments of finance. It is a constantly changing field and you are provided with all the tools you need to perform well at all levels.

good,"Discover has awesome benefits including but not limited to insurance and a huge amount of PTO. "
good,"I was a contractor there for ten months. Within a month of being on the job, my manager left and the project I was hired on to manage was shut down. The management team couldn't have been more nice and could have easily cast me off. While I wasn't kept as busy as I would have been I still felt like I was making an impact and made some great connections."
good,"I talk to about 100 people day, with various issues. I've learned that every person's story is different, so take the time to really listen. Management is very supportive of all decisions. Coworkers are just as supportive as management. The hardest part of the job is hearing about a death, or when a customer has fallen on hard times. The most enjoyable part is getting to know people and establishing a relationship with them."
good,"I enjoyed working here at Discover Card, and progressed quickly. Great place, great people, great attitudes. love love love love love this place"
good,"The hardest part of this job was dealing with frustrated people and having no hardship programs to help them. I worked in collections, which is tough as it is and the day consisted of calling/answering the phones to set up arrangements. Overall, this company was fun to be a part of. Great benefits and all about teamwork and competitions. The only thing was, I thought I wasn't being paid enough for what I had to deal with."
good,"It's very great to work with fun people"
good,"A typical day at work was to take continuous calls. It was not uncommon to take up to 150 calls per day. I learned a lot about going the extra mile for my customers. I treated each customer with the utmost respect. "
good,"good place to work, I have met a lot of good people to work with. There is a positive atmosphere. I work 7-2:30, they have flex time shifts, part time shifts and full time shifts. I have learned a lot about fraud, that we have such technology that people can get a hold of a card holders card # and purchase things, discover card has a zero fraud liability, so when there is fraud, the customer does not have to pay the charges on their account. I enjoy helping people, helping a customer understand that they are not liable for someone stealing there info."
good,A typical day in the office included logging into the systems to be able to properly assist the clients. It was a fast pace environment that allowed you to really tend to the need of the clients while also showing them that you cared for them.
good,"A typical work day is generally fast paced where we share in the success and work team to ensure the amounts being collected met the up to date amount. At times it was stressful but the rewards for the day. I learned where I stood as far as my skill set was concerned. As well as places in need of improvement. The management was pretty organized and varied in different backgrounds and approaches. Coworkers were pretty positive and upbeat for the most part. The most enjoyable part is getting to know people, building relationships and rewards."
good,Great working environment and a lot of support. There is a lot of interaction with co-workers and upper management. Company cares about their employees.
good,"interesting place to work,environment was great.fun and exciting.the management staff was great polite. The pay was excellent."
good,"Very loyal atmosphere"
good,"While the job itself is extremly tedious and most manament is fairly serious about people being on the ohones, the atmosphere and co-workers make the job a bearable one."
good,I worked with staff and customers to maintain and keep financial accounts open. Balance transfers were very high volume. I loved meeting my goals for this company.
good,"Handle past due accounts"
good,"Discover Financial Services is a great company to start your career, but after a few years that I have been there I have realized that I am looking for further advancement that they can't offer. As stated above if you are looking at getting that initial experience it is a wonderful place to start."
good,clock in bring up programs in the computer get logged into the dialer system collect on 30 to 90 day accounts and take breaks and lunch when needed then clock out shut down and go home
good,Good Company | great co-workers | worked from home four days a week | great fitness center.
good,"premier award holder bny mellon,payment processing centre"
good,There were great co-workers and a great workplace atmosphere.   I was given many opportunities to advance and did so.
good,Good place to work; good leadership; great work/life balance
good,"At Discover I have always had the opportunity to expand knowledge about the business and have had options to move and learn in other departments. I have learned different ways to view things and a lot of how to carry yourself professionally to diverse groups of people. "
good,"A typical day was busy, but not too bad. Overtime was offered if you wanted it. I learned quite a bit about the financial industry and that there are still good companies to work for. Management was terrific! Co-workers were friendly and helpful during my training stage. Hardest part of the job was getting people to use their credit card during a recession. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that if I had a question, my manager was right there coaching me."
good,"Discover as a company is a fantastic collection of people that are friendly helpful and supportive. Everyone really becomes family. However, the constant changing of business policies leaves employees exhausted, particularly frontline employees who are most affected by the fallout these changes bring. When things are rough, they're quite rough, but when things are great it's one of the best companies Ive ever worked for or with."
good,I only was on assignment there for 1 month but the atmosphere was very good.  I had a good experience working there
good,"Troubleshoot different equipment and repair. Install conduit for different voltage for UPS power, Normal and Emergency power.Work on kitchen equipment."
good,"I work with amazing and helpful people, my questions are answered when I need help."
good,"I would typically arrive at work around 4:30 A.M. I would get my desktop ready for the day by changing out messages we were leaving that day, and bring up all my programs that I'll use throughout the day. I clock in at 4:45 A.M. and some times we have a start up meeting and then we chit chat until around 5 A.M and then we log into our dialer and start receiving calls. Using our strategies throughout the day making calls to get customer contact. Things usually start winding down around 1 P.M. and we all get ready to clock off at 1:15 P.M."
good,I'm not the kind of person that can sit in a cubby hole and take phone calls.   Co-workers were the best!  everyone was willing to help each other.   Very enjoyable when we were able to meet our goals for the day and week.
good,Discover ALWAYS provides opportunity for learning and growth. They provide extensive training and always makes sure that everyone are team players.
good,"Easy place to work if your self motivated, compensation and advancement are definitely there"
good,I can utilize my customer service skills with this company.  I can learn new ideas about Finacial Services and assist the clients with their needs.
good,"I was with the company from the beginning. The Wall street journal said "" Sears was selling $1 for .50, Discover card will not last"""
good,I am deputed from India and working for this client DFS. In this tenure have learnt both technical and functional knowledge.
good,"8 hour overnight shift required being constantly available for answering wide variety of calls. Assisted with taking payments, filing complaints, helping customers apply to increase credit limit, working soft collections calls."
good,typical day is to come in leave the message of the day  talk to third parties an also get card members on the line to transfer over to a collector. Management is pretty cool you have the ones who are not so nice. LOVE my team and co-workers the hardest part of the job is getting a card member on the line. the people make the most enjoyable of the job
good,call customers about delinquent accounts and try to collect them
good,"The medical benefits are great. Discover takes care of their employee's but the job is mentally hard. People come. People go. "
good,"I learned Processing qualified student loans and applications."
good,Discover was a very professional business. Management and supervisors were motivated and eager to educate and promote. Benefits and Pros were very good. I worked in the Collection department which you can deal with a lot of unhappy clients and can get you bogged down. They hire qualified co-workers and gives you great flexibility in work times. 
good,Discover Card Services is a wonderful place to work
good,Learning Experience in a Financial service to assist customers
good,Discover provided great experience. Helped me become who i am today.
good,"A typical day was taking inbound calls explaining interest charges on account, why they were there and why so high. Reviewed transactions on the account. Refunded late fees, interest charges and followup on additional charges to refund back. We had to try and sale products on the client accounts."
good,Discov er is a super comfortable company to work for and they have great benifits.
good,"Typical day at work could be stressful but there were provided ways to relieve stress. great Benefits, Helpful coworkers"
good,I had a great time working with discover i learned alot and really enjoyed the co workers
good,Discover card is a great place to start a career and advance in business degree.
good,"When I go into work I already know what is expected of me. I love the diversity and learning all the new cultures that are apart of the work culture. Management follow policy and procedures some are more micro-managing than others. The hardest part of working here is giving bad news but, is needed so the customers can look to outside resources. The best part is they are always feeding us and have games going on. Its a high stress job, but the management team work hard to make the day fun. Like having Snack Carts coming around. Getting catered snacks and or lunches in our VIP room. My favorite part is there is always room for change in position and the benefits are amazing. So if you like to work in a Call Center Environment this has been my favorite experience,"
good,The seasonal position is busy for the summer. Different times to choose from. Contests & lunches & benefits are plenty. Everyone is friendly. You get to stay on after the season if you work hard and keep attendance up. Not much advancement for this position though. Unlikely to be able to transfer to other departments either.
good,The flexible work hours allowed me to volunteer as a coach for several sports. This allowed me to approach work with more enthusiasm and energy.  Great benefit!
good,"Supportive company. Does loads of fun events for employees. Lots of training and good benefits from day 1. Onsite gym, loads of choices in cafeteria including starbuck."
good,Discover Financial Services is a great place to work. I learned a lot during my time there and was exposed to a variety of different areas of the business.
good,I have not worked here in years and do not know what the company is like now. When I did work there it was a great company to work for and I would love to go back.
good,"very busy place and a very large building, so you easily get lost anywhere you go. Busy, loud and very hectic. Multi tasking all day long. Answering phones and assisting customers with any inquiries or problems needing to be solved on their account."
good,"Amazing call center experience for a first job; Team Leaders are always willing to work with agents for personal and professional growth and the General Managers are always friendly as well as the VP. If I could gain the opportunity to work for this company again, I definitely would."
good,"Discover is a great company with amazing benefits and culture, however there is zero innovation at Discover. Very little willingness to change, which makes working there a bit monotonous."
good,"Good career for someone without a degree or someone who wants a degree "
good,"Wonderful place to work good environment clean bathrooms and break areas. I really loved the calibrations we had with our teams because we listened to our calls and got feedback to see what can we do next to make it better on our next call. what I didn't like was the consent change in management, I feel like they need to work on somebody who is available to stay longer and willing to help."
good,"I wish Discover had been a better fit for me, the three years spent there were rewarding and it was great to be a part of a company so committed to caring for their customers."
good,Awesome work life balance in the job along with competitive salaray and benefits. The new lean management framework has created an excellent improvement in the way the projects have been executed.
good,Call center with a high call center. I currently work here.  Overall Disco is a good company to work for however I am looking for a career more tailored to my new degree.
good,Great job educates you well lots of fun benefits and atmosphere make friends cause it makes talking on the phones easier get your own desk typical call center
good,"Seriously my biggest issue was not falling asleep. I always have and will recommend Discover Financial Services. Some coworkers are weird and just don't want change while technological integration presses. Excessive call times are a problem to the, but it isn't a con because they're ALWAYS been willing to fix it. They find a way to include you."
good,I really enjoyed working for Discover they are very reasonable with requesting time off.  The benefits are available from day 1 which helps draw in marketable job applicants.
good,"A HUUUUGE HR driven company but very complete in training to prepare you for your job."
good,"great place to work at but only if your a favorite. Discover has a lot of free lunches, tickets, prizes but if you want to go anywhere in the company you will have to kiss butt"
good,"A typical day would be answering phones all day with 2 breaks & a lunch (full-time.). I would answer about 100-150 phone calls a day, depending on call volume. About 50% of the people calling in would be to just make a payment over the phone, the other half questions about their account/Cashback/etc. I would say about 18% of people who would be calling in would be upset/angry but they help you train with that/ also let you have 15 minutes off the phone if it really messed you up. "
good,"Excellent company, great benefits. Because it is a large company, you will encounter all types: collaborative hard workers, good managers, bad managers, bad co-workers. But the company itself treats its people well."
good,Working for Discover was great. I loved everything about the company. However the position I held wasn't a great fit for me overall. I was unhappy which is why I ultimately had to leave.
good,"I worked for DFS for about 2 1/2 years. I had an incredible team leader, who made leaving very difficult (not because of road blocks, but because I valued him as my manager). I feel like the team leader you have makes all the difference in your experience there."
good,"It was a great place to work, there are many great bonuses you can receive and you are generally always rewarded for good work, the people really made the days fun though"
good,The company is very good to employees work and personal life is respected across the entire company. Promotions are earned from management individuals are looked at equally.
good,I loved working for Discover it gave me a lot of great insight on customer care and also helped me to be very flexible and manage my time due to the high call volume of customer calls
good,"The job pays nice, but not really a work/life balance. Can seem very Highschool and immature. It’s best to stay your self if you decide to work there."
good,"The work life balance is great but commuting from the city can sometimes be a drain. Decisions are not made quickly and company is risk-averse in general. Pay is fair, but PTO is extremely generous. Starting PTO allowance is 25 days, with ability to rollover up to 7/year."
good,"Discover Financial Services was a great company to work for. Their benefits were excellent, and didn't cost a lot to employees. The nature of a call center is redundant and being a bill collector is awful, but DCFS did a good job at offsetting those drawbacks."
good,Great work environment. Diverse and casual. Great benefits and pay is great. Many options for advancement and just doing something new. In depth training
good,"Discover is a good company to work for. If you have your high school diploma this is a good company to start with and maybe even build an entire career. It is a call center so breaks and lunches are scheduled for you. There are goals that you have to meet. It can be demanding. If you are competitive you will fit right in. Overall it is a great place, I was just not fond of collections and did not want to wait to post out to another position."
good,Discover put a lot of focus on the culture of their office. It was a great environment with a lot of potential to grow in the company. I enjoyed working closely with the people around me.
good,"I worked in Collections for my entire career at DFS. It is very fast-paced, competitive and an ever present chance for movement. I especially love the benefits available in the collections department."
good,"While this is a fast paced environment, it allows employees to learn a lot about what a career in banking can look like. There are multiple opportunities to move up within the company, particularly if you are willing to relocate. The biggest piece of advice, be prepared for change, often."
good,"My experience with Discover started off really great. They hyped up the company and made me very excited to be apart of the Discover family. Within a few weeks of starting I had finished my training and was doing great. After being there for over a year now I am still very pleased with the company, they are always pushing us to be better and they are very competitive with pay and benefits. However they told us we could be promoted within 3 months and having worked there for a year now and to have not been promoted I have decided to look for a better opportunity that will help me grow as a person and work in a field I enjoy and am happy in."
good,"typical day is on the phones doing customer service, my only complaint is the lack of career advancement unless you have good connections, and the great part is the way they try to make the work environment fun even though it is a phone based job."
good,"If you can handle sitting in a cubicle for 8 hours a day 5-6 days a week, making phone calls regarding peoples debt, I would recommend Discover Card to you. It got hard for me to sit there and make phone calls nonstop, I had a hard time being that sedentary and you get in trouble if you're off the phone for even 5 seconds. Despite many things that made me dislike the job, I liked the environment, the pay, and the benefits. I only lasted like 6 months but I also got promoted twice in that time."
good,"Highly recommended Discover Financial Services. Great medical, dental, vision and 401k benefits for the intire family. All shifts of available work hours."
good,"Compared to other companies I've worked for, Discover is by far the best. They like to reward employees and the benefits are top notch. The pay could be better, but that's my only complaint."
good,"I was interested to work with Discover card. I applied for a collections representative position and they placed me in a departement called cells, leaving voicemails all day. I talked to HR and they could not get me into collections - I quit shortly after."
good,Most of the time you hear how much people hate going to work. At Discover most of the time the work place environment was alway a delight and people (management) were always willing to help you and encourage you to succeed. The only downfall was the lack of willingness to work with difficult schedules. With the stress of family and school life I'd like to not have the additional stress from work.
good,Discover is a great place to work.  Very good management team.  Work/life balance is better than other companies.  Good advancement opportunities for advancement.
good,This was a super opportunity to collaborate with others in finding creative and positive ways to help customers obtain the information they desired.  Each interaction was a new challenge and caused us to think outside of the box and try new approaches in an effort to be successful.
good,This is a company that is dedicated in making it the best job you ever had and in making sure that the customer service delivered is always top-notch.
good,"Prisoner's management is aware that the job isn't the most fun and so they have a lot of fun activities and rewards for the employees. There are always games, raffles, and free food for certain departments."
good,Discover is a great place to work. i was in collections and there are many ways to boost you check..  they do treat thier staff well there .. great atmosphere
good,"I worked at Discover for a couple of years. It's a great company. Employees are basically spoiled, the company always comes up with surprises and delights which makes you look forward to coming into work. It's a call center so yes you will have your good days and your bad days, but I believe that goes with any call center you work for. Would recommend this company to anyone. The training is awesome, everyone is friendly and can be themselves. I love the time I've spent working there. I think it's great for anyone who needs the call center type of experience."
good,"Even though the work was busy and stressful, the environment was supportive and encouraging."
good,"Good company to work for, treats customer well and employees. Can get stuck in a bad dept but over all a good company worth your time. Great benefits."
good,"This place has a great work place culture with a very Midwest nice feel to it. However, it impacts to the point where employees are a little less direct than they should be."
good,Really great culture at Discover. I learned a lot on how to communicate to people and show emotion to customers. i learned how to talk to customers more professionally and how to gain customers trust. Management in my experience is not all that great. the hardest part would be not having understanding and reliable management. the best part is the culture and being able to help customers first hand.
good,"I loved Discover Card. I was a balance transfer specialist on the outbound call team. The management was very organized and supportive, I was a top performer because I trained so well and that gave me confidence in my job performance. Positive feed back and recognition! I loved my job and helping card members save money."
good,"working for discover is not a bad company an a whole, they have very good benefits compared to other companies, meet a lot of very nice people, for advancement managers can give negative responses"
good,"Discover has great benefits and fair practices, but phone jobs are not for me.  When your shift is done you can go home and not worry about work and dream about it in your sleep.  Management was pretty fair.  Nice facility."
good,A very open environment to work in. Hey care about your development and not being require to sell things is nice. Customer service is taught in depth along with system use to make your job and customer lives easier.
good,Discover Card is a great company to work for. Their first goal is employee satisfaction and then customer satisfaction and service. They expect the very best service from their employees and they provide superb training and incentives.
good,"A day at Discover Card would include taking phone calls, inbound and outbound, on delinquent accounts and working with members to get their accounts current and out of delinquency. "
good,"Discover Financial Services has a very good work culture, The environment here is enjoyable and challenging environment. The management and colleagues are awesome and very friendly to each other"
good,A typical day is getting inbound/outbound calls helping customers with needs and options. I learned how to help them on a daily basis and learned how to negotiate to setup on payments to help them. Management is always avable to help out when needed and makes sure everyone is up to date w/ compliance and daily info. Hardest part of the job can be keeping a positive attitude when speaking w/ multipule people however that can be made up when you are able to help a customer get back on his/her feet and save money in the long run.
good,"Its a great job to start out as, but its not for everyone. If you can make it out of CSE on the phones, its a GREAT place to work"
good,"They do their best to help you as an individual achieve goals and try to be there for you in personal matters. There's a lot of celebration company wide, department wide and team wide to look forward to"
good,"Being on dial system all day can be boring, but the management engages you and is into setting up fun competitive competitions to enhance productivity."
good,"You will easily move up in this company and make more money rapidly.  The people are fantastic. There are changes all the time, so be prepared to continue learning. The hours can be a pain sometimes, but they're open 5am-midnight so there's plenty of hourly opportunity."
good,The typical day is to be on phone calls with customers and assist with inquiries and provide benefits of the Discover Card. I learned how to manage customer accounts and help customers manage their accounts as well.
good,"Discover is a friendly and welcoming place to be. Everyone is kind and considerate and most jobs can easily be built around your life. However, for younger employees, you may have trouble finding a real challenge. This is definitely a corporate company; while they truly care about their employees, there is always a bunch of red tape to cut through when getting anything done. Different business units operate very differently, and some may offer more opportunities than others, so cross-promotion is the main way to move up the ladder."
good,"The typical day of what I do as a team coach begins with reading emails and replying to them. I make individual meetings with my agents to go over their stats and metrics. I blind listen to calls, and listen to my agents side by side."
good,On a daily basis i would interact with my managers in a very friendly way which allowed me to get to know them much better which i very much enjoyed.
good,Good place to work with supportive management and good co-workers. Benefits and compensation package is great. Offers flexible scheduling.
good,"- Fun place to work (but it's in the suburbs)"
good,Enjoyable place to work. The culture was accepting towards everyone. Never brought work home and the work place felt like a second home. Direct supervisors care about their employees success at work and in life. HR and Hewitt (the company HR went through) were difficult to deal with. For a call center it wasn't a horrible job.
good,"Taking inbound calls and making outbound calls to target markets to give special promotion to Bank acquires for using"
good,I enjoyed working for Discover Financial Services. Great place to work for driven individuals. Great benefits package and paid time off.
good,"Overall, Discover is a great company to work for, however it has been difficult to advance to positions that are not related in some way to taking phone calls. "
good,"Discover itself is a great company.  The environment is very supportive and compensation is reasonable, if not great.  Working for a call center can be very difficult though, so if you don't think you could do a job talking to people it won't be for you."
good,"My job was at the higher level of collections for Discover.  I worked at a Level 4, customers who were the further behind in payments. My job was hard and had a lot of pressure.  I personally enjoyed being able to assist people from across the country.  Taking ownership of the call making customers feeling comfortable.  Still doing my job collecting or arranging payments.  With the many tools and training given by discover, I really enjoyed being able to assist and work with customers.  Personally, I developed some good relationships with many of my co-workers from other departments."
good,"a typical day at work would be logging on and professional handling inbound calls regarding customer inquiries related to their credit card.There is no hard part if you love what you do, but i will say the best part is always satisfying the customer's needs and doing so with care."
good,It is a good work place for those who are still in school and then further in life. If you are goal orientated and want to be in a constantly changing ennviroment this is your place to be
good,"take incoming calls from solicited people looking for loans. Apply sales trainging while taken application to build repor. Review the application and information and make judgemental decision on approval of loans, then present and sell to customer."
good,Discover is a great place to work and to get your career started.  Discover is very employee focused.
good,"Reviewing accounts and making judgmental credit decisions based on federal lending regulations and within the parameters of company specific guidelines."
good,"Great place to start out and learn business and customer service environment.  Plenty of room for advancement.  Part time or Full."
good,"Discover card has a lot to offer, and wonderful benefits. However credit card phone services was not for me. "
good,"Discover has the one of the best benefit packages I've ever encountered. Some management can be stuck in their own ways or may be biased but overall, they encourage growth. Co-workers are nice except they gossip too much, but who doesn't?"
good,"Sold and completed balance transfers to current card members. I learned how to respond and speak TO telemarketers. To treat others as I want to be treated and keep trying no matter what. Its work, not personal. :)"
good,"Steady hours, great pay and phenomenal benefits. I have enjoyed my time at Discover and many more years to come."
good,"I learned great customer service skills, to either just start off a good conversation or even calm down an irate customer. Helped customers manage their personal financial accounts. Explained company policies to the customer and also different bonuses you have with your personal Discover Card. Offered products to sell to the customers and help them with their bills."
good,"Connecting on time: ready to explore option; to have a successful day. Every day is an experience of learning. It is important to have a great relationship with management and, co/workers it makes work enjoyable, you learn from one another from, difficult calls with different customer. The hardest part about the job is having an unhappy customer from miss understanding with a conversation with another rep. The most enjoyable part of work was enjoying helping customer and knowing that you parted on a happy bases."
good,"Having spent the last (almost) 8 years of my life at Discover, I love the place - it feels like home. Most employees have been here forever with no plans to fly the coup. The benefits are the best! Most managers are flexible to allow for work/life balance. Overall, a good place to be!"
good,Discover Card offers good benefits and a high energy work environment that is constantly evolving. Good advancement opportunities for those willing to do the work.
good,good place if you dont mind calls. Low on advancement but intro pay was decent. good cafe and good work culture. willing to work with you on scheduling.
good,Good Benefits and trainings for your job description.  Discover offered very through training good benefits for employees and offered a good balance between home and work.
good,"For 18 years I was a proud employee of Discover.  They have a strong culture that is consistently focused on the mission statement, values and goals. I believe that Discover truly strives to do the right thing by their customers, shareholders and employees. Unfortunately, my last 6 months with Discover were horrible.  This was primarily due to my direct manager and was complicated by changes and open positions above my manager, leaving me with no one to go to about it. I went to HR instead and didn't get any support. The onus was left on me to try to make it work. I heard through the grapevine that she'd promised my job to a friend in another department. I tried for the 6 months I worked for her win her over, but I think she decided before she'd even met me that she wanted someone else in my position. It was miserable and I finally felt I had not choice but to quit.  I think Discover would benefit from employee advocates in HR to help with issues like this.  They lost a loyal, hardworking, long-term employee because of the actions of one person."
good,"Discover is a great place to work if a nice work culture is important to you. The company puts a lot of value in its employees, and has great benefits. Cross-functional career movement is encouraged. The compensation is not as competitive as the other credit card companies in the industry."
good,Discover treats their employees like gold they have many amenities and a free clinic and gym on site.  They provide food for free on weekends and free coffee for their employees.  There are many opportunities to work overtime.  The pay is good and the benefits are awesome the only downside is that you are on the phones 80% of your day.
good,"GREAT place to start in your customer service field. They are very competitive, so if your really good at talking to folks and handling numbers at the same time, you will really shine here. Plus, your surrounded by beautiful people everywhere. Someone for someone to look at/talk to. Whats not to love about this amazing place? :)"
good,"Discover knows that handling other people's finances and trying to talk to clients about it can be super stressful. So they are constantly holding events and having celebrations with food to try and keep people in. They do have great benefits in regards of prepping for your future and insurance. However, it is a call center. And most people think that it is easy to sit at a desk and talk to people over a computer. And the thing is, it is. But it is so repetitive at times depending on your job level, and at other times it is so stress inducing. You will have customers who are so adamant on what they have to say or feel about their account, yet you have to try to explain to them what the policies are, why they are, and if there is anything you may be able to do to appease them. But if you can get past all of that it is a great workplace. I build model kits during/in between calls when i get the chance, and so long as you are meeting your performance expectancy, your team leaders don't really mind."
good,I absolutely love Discover Financial. We had alot of worker appreciation days.  Not to mention Discover won the JP award for one of the best jobs to work at for 2018.
good,"The job can become very mundane and redundant so I would advise bringing things from home to keep you busy. But if you can handle rude customers this job is perfect for you. You are graded on how you “care” for card holders and how you fulfill their needs. The entry level jobs range from $13 to $16. If you perform well, it’s pretty easy to move up. They give great benefits and a great cafe with a Starbucks."
good,"over all working at discover is fine. the pay is competitive  in the spanish department, however they speak a lot of the opportunities to move within the company however once i was there and speaking to long term employees, i realized it was not quite as easy as they made it sound."
good,"I love Discover. I love the people, I don't mind phone calls, and management is great. They work very closely with you to make sure you improve and move up! They don't babysit you; you are in charge of what you do in the end but you do contribute to a team and bring others down if you don't do well."
good,The atmosphere within the company is great. Inviting to new employees and makes people want to plant roots with the company. Management will give many different tools to employees to use to succeed and help with a possible career path.
good,"Managed a department of 120 agents with Team Leaders.  Drove strategic plans to carry out  vision of company.  Managed meeting with topics to help grow for career progression of employees.  Managed procedures and policies, to help with risk.  Developed Team Leaders for the next level within company.  Analyzed data, created strategic plans to drive the business forward.  Administered corrective actions and promotions when needed.  Created a culture that is inviting to help reduce turnover, with career opportunities.  Recognized and awarded top performing employees."
good,"Discover was a good employer, I believe they are generous in their compensation and in their paid time off, but the workload is large and expectations are very high"
good,The time that I was employed at Discover was short but I really enjoyed working there. the environment of the work place is great and the job is actually cool.
good,"Fast pace work place, almost non-stop incoming calls the entire shift. Fun people company takes great care of employees. Offers paid time off and other benefits."
good,Good balance between work life and home life. Ability to have a flexible schedule works well with family life. Ability to work at home is also a big benefit
good,Always listening and learning from our Team.  Great culture.  I have seen many employees move from internships to management very quickly.  Discover hires the best talent.
good,Keep in mind I worked in Cardmember Assistance(CMA)/ Collections.  So of course the job was taxing mentally due to having to help people over the phone rather then working face to face to help solve their problems.  But the Team environment and management support is great.
good,I would like to come back but on the card side l worked at Discover for 12 years 5 of it was on the card side l would even like to go to student loans
good,"While working at Discover, I became ill, I needed alot of time off, and ended up on short term disability, Discover Card worked really hard to keep me but unfortunately I needed more medical leave and I had to resign. They worked really well to help me. I highly recommend them, great company to work for."
good,"high volume call center, great benefits. the culture is great and they try to make it fun...but it is still a call center. You are also held to very high standard for call reviews!"
good,The only concern I have is the some of management is shady and would rather cover them selves then be there for there associates. Other then that it is a fantastic place to work .
good,"Fun and upbeat environment, with lots of group activities and games. Great Team Leads and a great team of people. I learned how to become faster at working and multitasking. Really learned how to be productive with my time. The hardest part of my job was helping other departments when our own department was behind on work. The most enjoyable thing about working at Discover was all the company activities and being able to bring my daughter to work for the events."
good,"Great culture, good people. Personally not about the call center life, but if you like to sit for 8+ hours a day this place is great for you. Benefits and management are great."
good,Call past due account and attempt to get a secure payment to keep accounts from going past due. Taking Phone calls with a customer trying to make arrangements due to an unseen hardship. Manager's would listen in on your call if you were having a hard time with the customer or to also help find a program that might work with them.
good,Productive and fun workplace. Excellent training. Excellent cafeteria and great benefits. I learned to work hard. Best part of my job was being able to help people with all questions with their accounts and making them happy.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a broad mix of business customers from IT, Marketing, Sales and HR."
good,"This is actually a great place to work! I would recommend! "
good,"I worked in the Phoenix location for a short amount of time but due to relocation I was forced to quit. In my time there I completed the training which was fairly easy. I really appreciate that Discover takes the time to install proper training before heading out on the floor and we had free lunch ALL OF THE TIME! Which was awesome lol. There are many perks to working here such as cafe, free lunches often, free gear ( coffee cups etc), outside vendors come in once in a while and career growth most importantly! The one thing that really bothered me about Discover are the break times. You don’t really get enough time on breaks if you’re part time which I really didn’t find fair. They’re really strict on phone time but they don’t give you enough time on breaks which doesn’t make sense to me."
good,"At Discover, they want you to work hard and have fun doing it! It's a family-like environment. People generally had a smile on their face when at their desks. I would recommend this job for fun and outgoing young adults looking to earn a decent wage with little to no experience."
good,"Balance, fair work place. Would recommend to a peer looking for a good place to work.  Nothing bad to say about work for Discover at all, my experience has been nothing but positive."
good,"If you love talking and growing professionally this is a great company. Discover promotes within and offers courses for professional development. "
good,"I cannot say anything bad about working here except one thing. It is very repetitive. You will be taking calls back to back for 7 1/2 hours, 5 times a week. You will be in a fast paced call center environment where you either sink or swim. There will be assistance provided and the training (at least my trainer) was excellent compared to previous call center jobs. I loved the company in general. The only reason I left is because taking back to back phone calls is something that I am just not motivated to do at this point in my life, even though it is something that I excel at. If you are seeking a position in a call center environment where you are able to excel and promote if you do well then this is a great place to work."
good,"very flexible work hours, caring company, learned allot about credit and collections. best part of working there was the people made you feel like you matter"
good,"Employer cares about employees.  Many programs to aid employees such as good benefits and work from home opportunity.  In Illinois, traffic is so bad that this is a great benefit."
good,"This is very good place to work, I just want to relocate for family reasons to the southern part of the US. They treat you very well and you have unlimited career opportunity"
good,"The company was a great company to work for,but the actual job itself was very stressful and hard to do on a daily basis mentally. Not enough team work for my personality type."
good,I love that I am given the opportunity to work from home. they do everything they can to keep their employees happy! We are constantly getting food and gifts and entered in raffles to win stuff.
good,"A typical day at Discover consisted of answering phone calls back to back, with two paid 15 minute breaks and one 30 minute unpaid lunch. Management was always available to help with any questions or concerns that arose throughout the day as necessary. The workplace culture was laid back and very welcoming. I learned a great deal about credit cards and how to understand what a customer is asking even if they do not fully understand what they are asking. The most difficult part of the job was not letting the calls become personal, in either a good or bad way. Overall, every day at work was enjoyably and the time tended to go by quickly."
good,I loved working for Discover card! They were always giving us free shirts and free prizes for working hard. There are always games and different things to make work a blast. Discover is a very fun place and was a great stepping stone for me.
good,"Very demanding as far as customer service and meeting your expectations.  Management did try and compensate for the work load.  Very upbeat at times,  Hard to move uo in company if you do not know any higher uos"
good,"One of the best places I have ever worked for. The perks and benefits are outrageous, and I would say Discover is a very generous place to work. It seems as though everyone you speak to, no matter what department or ranking, everyone wants to help and wants you to succeed. HR is separate, and is difficult to deal with at times. You can expect to advance fairly quickly, and if you are not satisfied with your job, there are so many opportunities around. Being in the fraud department, it is a very interesting learning experience. The points system among earning monthly commission is great, as long as you put the effort in and focus. The job itself, you can expect to do pretty much the same thing everyday. However, policies and procedure and script are an ever changing thing, almost daily. Love this job and the atmosphere."
good,In the beginning you learn from the best managers and they help you get into the full-time position ad receive benefits. It ha its hard times just like any other job but has a great environment and recognition of all the great work you're doing in the process.
good,"The trainers all suck. Most of them are condescending a-holes, who only care about what their incentive is going to be. Once you are actually out on the phone with your team, things are pretty great. Most of the team leaders genuinely care about your success, and that makes it worth dealing with the hellacious training schedules and trainers."
good,"Go to work in afternoon, come in to a fun environment.  Log in take calls help customers or dial out to resolve accounts.  Would have trainings or meetings depending on day.  Co workers would be sitting around along with team leads pretty laid back job."
good,"Good Job culture, and great benefits.   They allow you to balance life and family work schedule to balance out.    Job security is there but you must work hard to achieve your goals like anywhere else.   I would recommend this company."
good,Discover places and amazing emphasis on developing its people to reach their potential. The environment is awesome and a very fun place to work.
good,"Discover is a fantastic company when it comes to creating a healthy culture.  They believe 100% in their company values.  You are valued as an employee.  The benefits are great. "
good,I make outbound calls to pass due accounts from 30 days up to 210 days. I provided fees adjustments and payment plan to bring account up to date.
good,"Great company to start off your career. Limitless job opportunities, however very low pay."
good,Enjoyed working there. Very busy work environment but lots of fun activities to keep you motivated.
good,"My typical day a work is I take call from customer inquiring about there discover credit card.  I enjoy my co-workers, we all work as a team, when need. The most enjoyable part of the jobs is when i'm able to make a customer that call in upset,  happy at the end of the call. "
good,First real job and absolutely loved working there. I want something to advance into and it just wasn't working.
good,I handle approximately 120 outbound calls daily attempting to establish contact with card members to offer assistance on their existing accounts.
good,Managed and trained collections department team. Motivated team members to prevent ultimate company loses.
good,"Discover is awesome; they treat their employees great and its a great place to make new friends and earn easy money. With that being said, they do have a very very stringent attendance policy; their policy is basically if you call our 24 hours before your next shift starts you are fine and you won't be reprimanded, BUT if you call out the day you work or have to leave work because you are seriously very sick and cannot function, do not count on it to be excused. Doctor's notes are great but if you miss a day no matter what it will count against you. Also don't expect much change, it gets really redundant with the inbound calls because you quickly learn every call is the same and it gets pretty boring. But the pay rocks!"
good,"Very busy work schedule that has a great work-life balance.  "
good,I would recommend Discover to anyone looking for a job. I worked here for 5 years and had two babies while doing it. I was able to advance to other positions. They are very flexible. I love Discover!
good,Great place to work with the best benefits I’ve ever been offered  but only if you’re willing to sacrifice your personal life and possibly sanity with having to deal with the mundane tasks of a call center
good,Working for discover is an amazing stepping stone. It allows a lot of opportunity and you can advance to a lot of different places! If you are looking for somewhere to start your job career I recommend Discover card
good,"I really enjoyed my time with Discover until pretty much the very end. The benefits are fantastic and they genuinely care for their employees which shows in their culture. Management can be pretty hit or miss, some are great others are kind of meh. My main issue with working there and the primary reason I left is it is a high pressure environment, you spend the majority of your time on the phones, often times with angry customers. It gets to the point where after constant exposure it wears on you and become unhealthy if you aren't the type of person that thrives in that environment. "
good,"Management was great, but lack of upward movement in career made it difficult to continue working there. Very accepting environment though, a lot of extra clubs/events you can volunteer for."
good,"Its an amazing/fun/highly incolved place to work and test your capabilities. The staff there is always pushing you to be better and achive hugher standards. "
good,"Discover is a really good company to work for.  They offer tons of benefits, and good pay. If you don’t mind a call center environment, and sometimes getting back to back calls the entire 8 hours of your shift, this is a job for you. There’s barely a dress code, and you can have as many tattoos or piercings you’d like. This is a very inclusive company, does a lot of charity work for different minority groups, etc."
good,"This place had its ups and downs, they didn’t care about employees and much as customers. They wanted you to like robots , the coaching could have been more informative."
good,"Work environment is fun everyone is friendly. Amount of calls can get stressful. Hard to get morning shift if you don't start out with that. Countless opportunities to move up into high positions."
good,"You will spend the day assisting customers with their credit card accounts. You get 10 weeks of training and handle a wide arrange of issues. The work environment and management is very laid back and there are several opportunities to advance within the different departments. For those interested, there are also many different opportunities to work on different projects."
good,Ut's a great desk job to work. Everyone is friendly and very collaborative. This place is all about takimg care of customers and helping everyone advance their career in this type.of.business
good,It didn't feel like going to work because everyone was great.  It was a very comfortable atmosphere.  We knew what was expected of us and we worked hard to achieve company goals.
good,"Overall good place to work.  Clean, nice facility. Very diverse staff.  Very good benefits and a flexible schedule.  Especially for college students.  Great tuition reimbursement."
good,"Despite my position being temporary I enjoyed having worked at Discover Financial Service. The management staff were friendly and good people who wanted to help the customers and staff when they could. It felt like being part of a family and it was amazing for the time it lasted."
good,"Super fun environment and a very good cafeteria. Has a good atmosphere and everyone is so nice and generous, overall a great company to work for and to be apart of. Definitely am wanting to go back."
good,"Best company I’ve worked for. Great job, great pay, great manager, and best of all great work life balance! Very grateful. I would recommend Discover to anyone!"
good,"At discover there was a lot of room for advancement, good pay, incentives, and a lot of people to help when you needed it. Overall relaxed environment, but it is pretty consistant and as long as being on the phone for 6+ hours a day it was an overall good job."
good,My experience was pleasant. Some co workers were focus on drama and socializing. Majority or workers and supervisors were working to move up and continue growth in the company as a whole and individually
good,Discover is a good place to work with great people working. It is a fun environment and the management is friendly and helpful. A typical day at work involves having engaging conversations with customers and helping them with their inquiries. I have learned in my experience with Discover that the people working are friendly and willing to help with whaever someone needs. The culture is great. The hardest part of the job for me is all of the technical things that we have to say over the phones in order to get great scores on our calls. The most enjoyable part of this job is all of the friendly people and the benefits of the job.
good,"Opportunities for advancement"
good,Great place to work for if you are trying to move up in the company. great trainers to help teach you what you need to know.It is a very organized and professional place to work.
good,Discover is a great place to work with many benefits. Discover always works to keep employees engaged and happy. The one thing they could work to improve on is there minimum pay.
good,"Culture, benefits, people, work environment, ability to advocate for new ideas, ability to learn, ability to contribute, customer focus."
good,Very clear direction and encouraging environment.  Rewarding experience. They make sure you are always learning something new.
good,"A typical day at work as an Account Manager involves a lot of phone time, back to back. You have two 15 minute breaks and one half hour lunch break. Other than those break times, you are taking incoming customer service calls. The facility is very nice. It includes a large cafeteria, plenty of vending machines, and an on-site gym. There are also many break rooms with TVs and couches to hang out in on down time."
good,Great company and great managers that I worked with during my time with Discover Card. Learned a lot about credit cards and how the work being that I had no knowledge of them to begin with. Learned a lot about personal credit and how that worked as well which was really interesting and fun. The most important thing I learned while working with this company was how to help card members achieve a much brighter financial future which meant a lot to me. The hard part was dealing with card members that would become very irate and upset with their personal financial situations as well as myself having to contact them to see about payments and such. Although this was tough I still enjoyed the job overall and would recommend anyone to the company.
good,"I enjoyed working at discover but I needed something new"
good,Too long ago when I worked there to comment at this time.  It was a very employee oriented company.  Management cared a great deal for their employees when I worked there.
good,"some of the best people i could ever ask to work with. I learned so much about the credit industry and still have lots more to learn. The company itself is just awesome. The culture there is unlike any I have ever worked for in the past, they care about their employees and whats going on with them"
good,"Great face to face work environment, but always looking to save money, RIF or contractors, when it should be the low performers."
good,A typical day at work would be coming in and going to my desk and preparing to take my first call of the day. Since I did take several calls I did have to treat them differently but it consist of maintaining business by giving customers reason to keep the product they have. Also a part of my job was to sell other products the customer didn't have by the conversation and finding questions that I have conducted with the customer. I have learned many different things being on the phone like smiling on the phone and letting the customer know I am there to help. Management was always resourceful and always gave me the right tools and information needed for the job. There are times when they aren't available since the manager has several he is managing and helping but always came back to you in a timely manner. My co-workers were great and very competitive which always made work very interesting. Hardest part of the job was the quota and trying to meet it every week. Even though I was able to it still was hard because you never know what you are going to get from any one of the calls you have taken. Most enjoyable part about the job was the competitive work environment. Being able to have something to drive for every day was always fun.
good,Great place to work with job stability and room for growth. Supportive management team. Coworkers work together has as a team. The job wasn't very hard at all because they provide extensive training and help along the way. Work days are very busy but enjoyable because manangement and co-workers are friendly and supportive.
good,"Discover is a perfect opportunity for people who want to get a job and move forward within the company. Management is willing to help you meet personal goals to move forward. "
good,"Log on to program answer inbound calls from cardmembers, other authorized buyers, third Parties, merchant calls and even fraudsters that are trying get information. I talk to people about why their card is not working, activate new cards, send out new cards for lost cards and update contact information. I also offer other fraud protection benefits and assist in stopping fraudulent activity. Discover has a grading system that can see how a employee can work on a team. Management has team leaders and coaches to help us improve our workload. The toughest thing is the rating system which is always changing depending on what management wants. The most enjoyable part of the of the job is to help the customer with the various situations of fraud and how to protect them from future fraud. I work with team of 10-20 people daily. We have to work together as team to reach our department goals."
good,A typical work day would include supporting the home-grown applications and the end users who used them.  I learned a lot on the job about making and supporting software upgrades and working out the bugs.  My management team was top notch at Discover Card and always gave support when needed.  My co-workers and I worked closely together and helped each other complete our projects and goals.  The hardest part of the job would probably be learning when to leave for the day.  I was a salaried employee and would find myself staying 2 to 4 hours over on a regular basis to get the job done.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my team and co-workers...we had very tight relationships.
good,collecting money on loans past due inbound and outbound hardest part is hearing about the customers hardships
good,"A typical day at my job could be considered hectic in others eye's but I enjoy the challenge. My job duties include: "
good,Discover is a great company to work for. They care a lot about their employees and what they think about the company. I learned different sales techniques and communication skills.
good,Discover was a great company.  They had the greatest benefit and time off structure I have come across.  The people there were wonderful.
good,"it is a great fun place to work, i get along with a lot of people there. Its fast place to work. management is great and can be fun we can all joke around, i work nights so i love my night team that is the most enjoyable part of my job. the hardest part is working in collections because you do not know how someone is going to react."
good,"It's a good job to work for"
good,Handling customer concerns through the phone and providing best resolution. I've learned to handle difficult situations with a calm manner. Management does stand up for you as an employee as long as you are doing what is expected and following company policies. Co-workers are very professional and friendly. The hardest part is having back to back calls with only two fifteen minute breaks and one 30 minute lunch. The most enjoyable part is knowing at the end of the day you were someone's go to person and you were able to resolve their problem.
good,Discover is very flexible and its a wonderful place to work.
good,Discover promotes from within utilizing training classes to teach employees new skills for advancement opportunities. The Discover culture embraces all people in all walks of life.
good,"People do make a living while working at discover, but it is a call center so you have to adjust with staying seated and multitasking with typing, talking to customers and if needed getting help with the nearest supervisor"
good,"discover was a fun place to work at, some jobs easier then others but the pay wasn't enough at alland management wasn't great obviously not all management."
good,The jobs good the training makes you exited for your position you applied for. Management is cool and chill they really do work with you unless you work with them. There is a lot of potential in raises and promotions. If call centers is for you and you like sitting down all day. Then this job is for you. They have a lot of good benefits and compensation plans and incentives in your hard work.
good,"Great place to work. This was a great place to work. Great peers great management. They were great at recognition and making sure that those who were great and should advance, had the opportunity to advance. They constantly do market research to ensure that their employees are paid fairly!"
good,"Out of all the jobs ive had this was by far the best job. Pay didn't start off that great but it was easy to work my way up. there was always lots of support and training to help me be th best I could be. they had lots of fun activities for breaks. They did everything in their power to create a fun and healthy competitive work place. You can even win prizes and bonuses from raffles, or contests and such! fun place to work."
good,Working at Discover financial services was a great experience for me. We had great managers who didn't hesitate to help and properly guide us. We all worked as a time and the opportunities for growth were endless.
good,Loved working for Discover. They have a great work environment. They are all about their employees and keeping them happy. They could have more opportunities for raises and work from home.
good,A big plus is advancement opportunities as company itself wants one to explore their desires by hiring a position just for that within company! I was part of three different call channels and learned new skills within each. Typical day was receiving inbound calls with reviewing policy documents in between calls.
good,"Great people and executive, lots of on campus perks i.e. cafeteria, gym, nurse, volleyball and basketball courts. Positive environment and good communication throughout the company."
good,"At Discover, you're going to be out off by how large it is. There's a cafe for general food needs, a courtyard for the ping pong tables, relaxing chair areas through the building and many more features to come moving forward in the years."
good,"A typical day at Discover would be answering incoming calls and helping card member's process payments, card activation, increase of credit line, and over all understand how a credit card works. The great thing about my job was spending time with my coworkers, we all got along very well and we became instant friends. We would get close to one eighty calls a day, and that was tough, but having great friends and management support made work a bit more easy."
good,They are really great to work with and are flexible when it comes to work hours. Also keep you motivated to continue to work there with fun competition games.
good,Pay and benefits are spectacular. Co-workers were great. Perks are wonderful. Just not the job for me. I did not enjoy working in a call center environment
good,They do so many things for the employees. Great benefits and awesome amount of personal time off. though the requirement they have for being on the phone can be difficult.
good,I always came to work with the plan of being able to help someone. Knowing that there was always a resolution available. Being able to contact other departments for assistance/resolution or research of customer inquiries. We were always updated on new products and services.
good,"great enviornment, great co-workers, always room for advancement"
good,There are so many opportunities for advancement here. Great prizes and gifts.
good,A energetic environment where you can learn skills that can make you an asset.
good,"Excellent benefits, flexible work schedules, friendly atmosphere."
good,You're given all the training and more to succeed. Management is helpful and wants to see you do well. Very friendly and accepting environment. Lots of amenities as well
good,"This company is very family oriented and you immediately feel comfortable in the environment the moment you walk in. Training was immaculate and also included on the job training, taking live phone calls with the help of market area experts."
good,Staff are friendly and so are the coworkers. But there is a lack of delegation from the Management. Friendly environment but staff could be more involved.
good,"Discover was one of the better jobs i worked and it was because it had everything. Everything from great co-workers, to their own personal gym. Typical day for an Account manager was to find a station with your gear, (earpiece, notes, and your brain) and to turn on your phone an communicate with customers. Hardest part was sitting all day long, most enjoyable was the experience of it, new people, new stories, and the fact that your helping the next generation move on in life."
good,"I enjoy working for discover card, because of the people everyone is so nice and great company. I never did call customer before, this was first job opportunity at call center, I have learned a lot"
good,Fun place to work witth great benefits. Typical punch in punch out. Reviewed credit reports to get people approved for credit cards.
good,The department needs a lot of work. There are people in management that are not fit for the role. Always hiring because they fire offend then most departments at Discover Card. Ask to job showed always. Ask team members about position and the management.
good,"Great exposure, learned a lot, awesome culture. Started at a call center in Delaware, was placed into a Marketing internship at headquarters in Illinois, then received a full-time offer in the Corporate Risk department."
good,"Inbound Calls, I assisted Customer's with questions, off Statements."
good,this job is good if you want to advance and get stuck. management plays favorites no matter you skill level.. they always think of something that holds you back
good,"Show up to work, friendly people, friendly management, difficult customers, chained to a  desk all day. Any reason to get out of your desk is stressed to wait until your break (even rest room usage)."
good,"I loved working at Discover Card. Quit do to family matters and was needed at home, The job was great. benfits were great."
good,Cares about employees and offers good work life balance.  Management offers employees with many opportunities to expand their knowledge base and improve their overall IT Skillsets.
good,"This job can be very fun and a lot of the employees there seem to get along well.  My personal experience with this company is that I just felt overworked and that I wasn't being rewarded for my efforts. Just promised. A typical day is the same as every other day, sometimes draining but I did learn how to interact and be more personable with customers. The hardest part of my position was just the mentally tiring part about it."
good,you go in get on the phone and make outgoing calls to collect money the work is easy and the environment is pleasant for a cube farm. i would recommend this as a starter job
good,I loved working there; the commute is unideal but they have a downtown office as well. Great culture - nice people and laid back atmosphere. Overall would recommend.
good,Productive Environment  and nice work experience.Learnt a lot while worked in discover.Lots of learning opportunity and lots of growth opportunity.People and awesome.
good,"Working at Discover definitely had its perks, they offer an onsite gym and cafeteria for all employees. Otherwise it was your typical call-center/account management role"
good,The company truly is a wonderful company to work for and takes good care of there employees. Summer they took great care of there employees and also some of the management is amazing. Just wish the 24/7 departments offered more no weekends.
good,"goal driven work environment with friendly co workers with ""happy to help"" attitudes. an open environment with plenty of help and support from coaches"
good,"Excellent place to work, great assignments and talented people to work with.  Projects were well defined and reporting was very organized.  Senior management was highly visible to all employees."
good,"Discover is a company with a long, proud, history of excellent customer service and that is very apparent the moment you step foot in the door. They achieve this by implementing an upbeat ""culture"" so although it shares the same downsides as other call centers the company is far from boring."
good,"I enjoyed working at Discover, They train you properly for your job role and don't just throw you right in. The people I had the pleasure of working with, were amazing. Its a fun, fast paced environment. They have a cafeteria there with all sorts of food to choose from and drinks. Gym is on site. They do a whole bunch of goal oriented rewards in every department. Management is fantastic! My team lead was without a doubt one of the best people I have ever worked for. They have tons of different working schedules you can choose from and are willing to work with you on schedules matching to your needs. Very safe and fun working environment."
good,A great place to work that I really helped to tune my new career pathways to new opportunities. I still maintain relationships to mentorships I started at Discover
good,cool place to work. nice environment. comfortable. easy to learn. fast pace. get along with everyone. easy to move up in the company. great benefits. great location
good,"While working at discover, I received paid training and opportunity to stay on as a permanent employee. The culture at Discover Financial Services in the student loans department was awesome. They were always doing workplace activities and giveaways to boost morale."
good,"I really liked the job there, but I wasn't into finance/banking, so I left to start a completely different career path.  I'm much happier, but Discover is an amazing company to work for, and I feel like they really appreciate their employees."
good,Was a great opportunity to work and develop friendships. FinTech is an ever-growing and emerging market. There are opportunities to learn the different facets and gain insightful experience.
good,Great place to work. I would encourage everyone to spend a few year working here. The training and development for employees is awesome. I grew more here than anywhere else
good,"I loved it ! I miss it "
good,I work in collections but it’s pretty nice. You have the cardmemebers that will hate you and get mad but overall the people and atmosphere can be pretty cool if you let it. Just don’t like the card memebers get under your skin
good,"I would recommend Discover Financial Services as a workplace. They promote motivated employees, provide excellent benefits, and they have a great work/life balance."
good,"Great pay, people and benefits. There's a place for everyone there: very inclusive workplace. Plenty of training and management support. Positive work environment."
good,"Discover card is more than just offering credit services.  It is a way to help those in need and if you work in the security department, to thwart someone from using a stolen card."
good,You get the opportunity to move up in the business within 3-6 months of working there. They have tons of great benefits for their employees. They are awesome!
good,Nice work environment with opportunities and helpful coworkers.  It's a good work environment with medium paced work levels. Highly recommended. Great company.
good,Discover is a very fun and competitive place to work at I just wished I work there permanently. If it wasn’t for my car messing up I would of stayed forever.
good,"great environment, and great understanding management. It's well organized and highly regulated. If you're unhappy, upper management will want to do anything to make sure you are happy and taken care of."
good,"Loved working for Discover, the commute just took it out of me with living in Utah County. Overall, amazing company and values who really try hard to advance their employees and create a good environment."
good,It was a great place to start at when going into a banking and call center environment. Most days are fast paced but they really take the time to prepare you for your everyday tasks.
good,I have worked for few months only and my experience here was really good. I worked on ALM and cards domain. I have learnt how cards domain works . It was a good learning
good,"Great place to work, great benefits. nice building, needed more parking spaces. Benefits start on day one. fun atmosphere, great co-workers. loved it!"
good,I really enjoyed working for discover it was a fun work environment with fun people. The training was on the job so you knew what you were needed to do. It also had a lot of great was to advance in the work place.
good,Discover loves their employees just as much as they do their customers and they expressed that to me while working there. Positive work environment and lots of incentives.
good,"Best Work Place with friendly work environment. Good Growth opportunities. Helping colleagues, open environment, good work culture. Happy to be back for another opportunity."
good,Discover was a great company to work for. There was a good corporate culture and I got along with everyone. It was a great place to go and gain industry experience.
good,"If you're looking for a busy place of employment then this would suit you perfectly! It's a call center- you're always on the phone from helping card members to leaving messages for them to return. The management is excellent- always encouraging their employees to keeping reaching for success at the end of the day. We all have our difficult days; card members can be hard on you from time to time, because let's face it, nobody likes to get a call regarding their account being delinquent.I definitely did my best to make the card member to feel at ease. There's nothing better than to hear your client say ""Thank you so much for calling me today, I appreciate your help, have a good day!"""
good,"Talking on the phones all day to customers is not always easy. People say things over the phone they wouldn't say in real life, and at times is overwhelming. Having people there to help answer your questions while on the phone was always a plus. A good group of staff worked for Discover, and they always took care of their employees."
good,Great place to work and pursue career growth.  Training provided to get you up to speed on current position as well as many opportunities to consider other areas.
good,Overall great company and magnificent work atmosphere.!!! I work there has a contractor and it is so professional to be in. Great team to be on...Highly recommended.
good,"I would suggest that you get in get experience and move on, longevity is not recommended, because once you no longer fit what they want or need, they will find some way to eliminate you rather than move you to a place in the company that you can excel.  26 yrs of service and sacrifice and you can be walked out the door.  Not bitter just realistic and honest."

good,I like that they have a wide range of different departments. It is an amazing environment and a fun place to go to work. I enjoy this job and Im glad I have the opportunity to work there.

good,"This company defiantly takes care of its own. They do have great benefits, and they do actually care about their costumers."
good,"My shift began at 4:45 am until 1:15 pm. I had both inbound and outbound calls. I learned how to speak to upset customers but listening, apologizing, and fixing any situation i could. My management was incredible. They were there to help but gave me freedom to make my own mistakes and learn from them. I gained many friendships working at Discover Card that i will cherish. The hardest part of my job was understanding all the new technology for the systems that Discover Card used. Overall, the most enjoyable part of my job was being able to help people that truly needed it."
good,Great company to work for.  They cared about their employees and clients.
good,"I was extremely young when i started working here. "

Working with high schools students was an rewarding experience in helping each student receive the tools they need to prepare them for college. The hardest part of the job was tracking the students when they did not show up for class. The most enjoyable part is watching them graduate from the program."
good,Answered inbound and outbound calls to verify sales transactions.
good,"Fun work place, excellent benefits, horrible work experience."
good,"I was also responsible for all support requests, via phone, emails and in person, through help desk Ticketing System (Peregrine). Resolved escalated support related tickets within the SLA timeframes, while providing quality customer service."

good,Assisted all customers with any questions or concerns they may have with their account.
good,Assist Card members in getting account current and keeping account current
good,"When I was there, I"
good,I worked for discover for 22 years it was a great place to work for.  I started as a data entry operator and at retirement was an account manager.
good,this was a graet job i lean so much from this job in customer services. i help the people that was default in there loans and what ever else they need help with. We tock 8 weeks of training in customer services.
good,It was a credit card company where there was data entry and embossing of consumers information on their accounts.
good,"This company believes in taking care of it's people and recognizes the need for a professional, yet fun atmosphere to encourage the most from it's employees. The company provided extensive training and supplied excellence technology and tools to complete the work."
good,Too short of braaks and lunches. Flex full time is actually part time. They do care about the employees and bonuses is great each month. The cafe only allows you to use cash or a discover card which can be a bummer at times.
good,"It was a great place, but they do not pay nearly enough to support a family. It is very difficult to afford to live with the pay. I love the people though."
good,"1) good bonus"
good,Was a fun company to work for. Always had games and festivities to keep up productivity. Was a great job to grow with.. Was cool
good,"I was in retention, so I was the last line of defense. I got the customers that wanted to close their accounts. My team had lots of incentives which made the job easier. Also they did a lot of team bonding, weekly contests, and there's a gym onsite."
good,"It was fast paced , the culture was great , management definitely tried to assist everyone by pin pointing weaknesses and giving employees different ways t deal with certain situation that may arise with clients. The hardest part were the hours. I enjoyed building relationship with clients"
good,Great company with a wonderful workplace and culture. The minute details are also taken care of and the management is wonderful. Utmost importance is given for client satisfaction with wonderful work ethics.
good,Discover Financial Services was a very fun place to work and full of diversity.  Management was supportive.  The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the people and management.
good,Discover was very fun to work with. The only thing that I thought could need some improvement is the time you can receive a promotion. I worked there for about a year before becoming more advanced and I did my work as supposed to be. The expectations of what you needed to do for customer service were too high for the amount you received an hour.
good,"The atmosphere was pleasant the management and supervisors were good. The facility was amazing! It is by a lake. There was a gym, but you had to pay to use it. The cafeteria was amazing. They even brought a a sushi cheff in twice a week."
good,"Great job, Management is very political. Not much is taken seriously. It takes a lot to come into work. Hopefully they will work on it."
good,"Being honest, I liked the technical side of this job, but not the environment. I enjoyed learning and getting to see how a credit card company is put together from the inside. I didn't enjoy how their insensitive programs were put together and how it took so long to move to a higher paid position."
good,"A typical day a work was always very busy, and sometimes very stressful. "
good,Discover is a very diversified company...which I think is great
good,"I did not like the fact that your schedule would change a lot, and it was not fixed. for example your start time would be 8am and they operate on a flex so they can work you 2 hours before 8 or 2 hours after 8. Hard to work around when you have to use a daycare."
good,you start in a classroom but its all about you learning the trade and if you have a passion for it it doesn't feel like school. you slowly move onto the floor and from there you become your own employee though they do have lots of encouragement through out the process.
good,"I had the opportunity to work as a contractor for DFS in 2018 for ten months. It was a terrific experience and I really enjoyed the work and found it to be fulfilling and meaningful. The facilities were very good and for the most part, it had a congenial feel with a heavy multi-national focus. My manager was exceptional. The only reason why I left the position was because after ten months of waiting and  early indications that the position would go from temp to perm, it still hadn’t happened so I had no choice but to leave when offered a perm position with much shorter commute."
good,Great start for someone’s first job or someone coming out of retirement. I enjoyed all my coworkers very much and the culture is very fun. There are allot of small perks.
good,"I went through a lot while I worked at Discover, and they were flexible with me during a hard place in my life. I didn't feel like there were many growth opportunities to move up  in the company but there may be now."
good,With Discover being such a large company it’s easy to feel like just a number. I feel like the management wasn’t personable but the company overall was very nice.
good,"This was my first professional job and originally I had no plans of staying. I started working at Discover as an agent in Collections, a career choice I never even thought of as a possibility. I was excited, and dreading, my first day because of the stereotype of a collector. That just isn't who I am."
good,Not Applicable - My rating is only bad on he compensation and benefits.  No management support - no training no assistance with problems except remotely was estremely frustrating.
good,"Collaborative, team-based approach"
good,Been with the company for just over 5 years. It can be easy to promote within your current department or outside of your current department. Most departments provide support to their employees to move forward in their career.
good,"Good place to work, I did not want to do this Indeed does not give you a choice to skip//then gives you a minimum that you have to write//All I wanted to say was Discover is a great place to work"
good,"The beginning days were wonderful, it was family oriented, but later years they forgot take care of not only customers but the employees that keep the business going."
good,"inbound and outbound calls, friendly customers and employees . fun environment, big café and they have a game room for there MVP employees, basketball court"
good,I love working at Discover because the work environment was very welcoming as well as all the employees were fun people that enjoyed working and helping each other.
good,Typical day at work was walking in getting everything set up and talking to people on the phone all day. everyone there was super kind and care about your well being
good,Started work at 5:45 every day. Took outbound calls. Was recognized for making process improvements. I personally didn't enjoy the call center environment. The most enjoyable was being able to constantly learn a new process.
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of politics, but this is expected of a big company. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with people directly and learning from them. The office started to get crowded as the company grew."
good,"Great place to work. great work life balance."
good,"*Large focus on Career Development plus Resume Writing Workshops. "
good,"The collection base as great and it had the best staff and  I love the open door policy the company had,"
good,"I was there for many years, worked in several different Discover products and in several different capacities.  In general, it was a great place to work and the more you put in the more you got out.  I was able to find new challenges every couple of years, I was able to work on and build great teams there.  I was a super efficient worker but I was able to keep work mostly balanced with the rest of my life outside of certain big moments.  As I moved higher up and the funnel got tighter for advancement it got a lot more political.  I saw less talented and less successful people move up faster than I did, but with personal growth and 20/20 hindsight I also see many things that I would have done differently that would have helped my case.  I would ""recommend to the right friend. """
good,"I loved discover, the company was great. The job itself was hard on me. Constantly getting yelled at by customers but training was very well. Some team leaders were not nice but other then that great experience working for Discover!"
good,"Working for Discover card was great, Their are a lot of pros and Cons about working for that company. I just wish management was better and i did resign from my position but I will return soon."
good,I really enjoyed the work at home aspect.  I felt more productive with less distractions and was able to really focus on the job I was doing.  This is not to say that working in the building was not good.  The environment was good there as well.
good,"Discover was great. I loved the early shift, but hated working the inconsistent hours on the weekends.  It was supposed to be one weekend a month and ended up being 3.  Wouldn't have been bad if it was my regular hours."
good,The company is great in a whole but they are more customer service base then business not all customers are good customers and everyone is not honest but discover lackes staying fern on having bad business the loss of money to fraud is crazy and with no justice behind it not just with discover but all cc fraud is the highest paying job cuz its easy and the police don't do much
good,My experience at this job was good.  Everyone was very friendly and welcoming. Everyone works well together and help is always available when needed .
good,Overall I had a good experience at Discover. I was able to Learn systems such as Unix and FastData that I may not have had the opportunity to utilize otherwise. I am able to appreciate the value of working with a team to accomplish goals by a given deadline. The environment at discover is a good one to be in they have a lot of company events allow you to interact with other departments.
good,"Great benefits! 5 weeks vacation for some to start"
good,"Located in Phoenix, AZ.  A Team oriented company - lots of activities and recognition of achievements.  Loved working there.  However, salaries are not equal to responsibilities."
good,"Unfortunately I was only a contractor.  The pay was low and I left for 1.57 times the amount.  I could not afford to stay long while paying for my own benefits.  I really enjoyed the people and work."
good,"great company to work for, management is understanding and with work with your situation, not recommended if talking with people is not your thing. good stock options."
good,Customer service sucks so much literally I hate it but Discover really tries hard for employees not to be super miserable with incentives and events and free food
good,This shop was closed in 2008 putting over 300 people out of work because Chicago based CO waneed payment processing moved to Utah. This was heartless & w/o sound business reasons. Some older 30+ year employees were unable to find employment.
good,"Great Benefits, People and programs.  I think the company was great  to work for.   They pay well and are good to their employees.    I would recommend it"
good,"As far as call centers go, Discover provides a fun work environment with upbeat staff. Attendance and adherence to your schedule is pretty strict. You will spend your day answering a high volume of calls in your department. Calls are monitored and graded for future coaching."
good,"During my time at discover card (10 years ago), I can honestly say that it was a great place to work in. The environment was positive and relaxed. My only problem with the company at the time was my weekend schedule. I didn't have a car then, and relied heavily on public transportation. During my time there, public transportation ran every few hours, and didn't run at all on Sundays. This interfered with my job. My other problem was when my son fell I'll. Because of my situation with transportation, I used up my personal time, so when my son got sick, I had no more sick and personal time, leading up to me resigning. Other than that,  awesome company."
good,"Pretty great place to work!"
good,"be prepared for stressful days at the office and the pay sucks $11.00 bucks an hour when I was there"
good,"agile working environment, lots of different projects within the company to work on, management is supportive, get to interact with different hierarchy levels"
good,"Good company ethics, good work environment. Friendly and down to earth executives. Typical day at work involved multiple meetings and conference calls with internal departments and external clients. Monitoring employees productivity, validating project management tools and finding strategic solutions to satisfy both the client and company needs. The hardest part of the job was finding solutions in an environment where no such requests were ever enabled. The most enjoyable part was making a difference with my employees, clients and seeing the impacts to the company's bottom line."
good,Excellent culture and staff. You are provided the tools to succeed. Senior leadership and staff are committed to your development and professional growth.
good,I loved the opportunity to learn more about the plumbing industry.  I also enjoyed the opportunity to drive around the city and meet new contractors.
good,"It was the best company to work for and would highly recommend people to start there as their first job. Great management, great coworkers, and great benefits."
good,Very laid back atmosphere management is great . i love working there

good,"I really enjoyed my position. I would come in, work on my projects and my eight hours are done."
good,"Worked in all phases of collection, leanred the financial end for both a company as well as an individual. Learned cohesive work environment and team is what leads to success."
good,No complaints I would do it again. I loved the people and the atmosphere there. The pay was not too great at the time. I love the amount of training they put into the worker shows how vested they are into you as an employee and individual.
good,"Enjoyable people, lots of opportunity.  Great education benefit to further your education.  Work life balance is excellent.    Benefits are just ok, but I don't think they are great anywhere anymore - expensive for medical everywhere it seems."
good,"Have you ever seen a video of what it's like to work in a call center? It's exactly that, but you get paid decently well and the benefits are out of this world. I loved Discover, just couldn't handle collections. I will say that it is practically impossible to leave collections for another department, if you want to end up doing that. This is mainly why I left, as they wouldn't let me just ""switch"" or ""transfer"" departments."
good,Great people to work with. Managers and coaches motivated you. My co-workers were extremely nice to work with. Campus site was nice to walk on. Security was awesome.
good,I've worked for Discover for almost 14 years and I'll probably never quit! They usually take care of their people and have been with me as I've grown my family. Discover is always trying to improve and I love how much they are a part of the community!
good,Easy typical work day just took phone calls the whole time. Learned how to speak to customer in a confident manner while helping them. Great management.

good,Discover was a wonderful to work with different cultures.  I never did have a bad day I loved my job.  I learned more about the company and I always loved to get training on different products.
good,I enjoyed working with Discover.  They offered many perks to employees. We received bonus in addition to pay for hitting our goal collections.  The healthcare benefits and PTO were also great.  They also offer company match 401K and tuition reimbursement.
good,Overall Discover was a great place to work. I only left this job to relocate and take a break from work. I would go back in a heartbeat if there were a location nearby.
good,"Collaborative place to work, work was interesting, many employee-centric items like food court, gym, shuttles to trains.  Can-do mentality.  Enjoyed working in legal department."

good,"I worked in Click-to-Chat and email. It was fast paced, but I was well compensated. The management team was not my great. I don't thrive in an environment where there are favorites. I like a fair and balanced work place."
good,Structured environment yet can be relaxed in ways.  Most managers are very supportive with their employees.  Good options to move to other areas/departments
good,I have worked at Discover in multiple rolls for just over 8 years. They offer tons of advancement and great benefits. I would suggest working at Discover to anyone who wants a great opportunity for advancement and working with great people.
good,Discover is a great place to work. The overall moral make for a very refreshing experience. Discover is always willing to listen to feed back from their employees and implement right away.  Discover always has some type of free give away or employee appreciation.
good,The most recent position at Discover was in Billing Disputes. Overall it was a decent call center to work at with management that did care about the employees.
good,I have been very thankful for this coming. I have been very dedicated in helping it grow. I always love talking with the customers and hearing how much they love dealing with all the Representatives when they call in.
good,"I had a temporary job, so some of the other employees didn't have much drive to be proactive, but the managers were great and I liked the work and being in a work environment that promotes constant progress."
good,Being on the phone as a phone agent was boring and they put a lot of pressure on you staying on the phone for the 8 hrs. The better positions where you get to be off the phones are limited. Pay WAS good. It use to be $5 above minimum wage but when minimum went up to $10 in AZ we didn't see an increase in pay for long time employees.
good,"Discover is one of the best companies I have ever had the pleasure of working for. They are very family oriented open and fun! You know its a good place to work when you wake and want to be there! They have competitive pay, management is great, they are very understanding and treat everyone as an equal! I would chose discover over any other job opening and if I have the chance will definitely be going back!"
good,"Nice place to work with"
good,"My experience there was overall good in a sense that I met some cool people and there is room for advancement in the company for sure... My manager was something else though, I had a family emergency that involved my aunt going to the hospital and I had to leave work early (computers were down anyways that day) and my manager told my sister who was the one who called about the emergency and had said to her that it ""doesn't sound important seeing how it isn't like it is my mom or anything"".... lost all respect for my manager and ultimately didn't feel comfortable returning..."
good,"I started on the phones and worked my way up to the more technical teams and eventually into the HR department when I earned my degree. I was happy with the advancement opportunities that were afforded me. I was always really happy with the work environment, beautiful campus, you could walk around the lake during breaks. I went to the onsite gym before my shift and taught some of the group fitness classes. My teams were always really cohesive and fun. We worked together to improve processes and communication. The onsite cafeteria is very impressive, a lot of variety. The all employee meetings were impressive, music, excitement, fun and prizes. The actual work is monotonous. If you are on the phones it takes grit to get through the day. In the HR department it is high volume recruiting and you have to find motivation within to keep hitting those high recruiting goals (100 hires a month)"
good,Discover has a family like feel and they continue to find ways to increase moral almost daily. The benefits are great and the people friendly. I enjoy working for this company

good,"I LOVE that Discover holds true to their core beliefs and mission as a company.  They value doing what is right, and care about the customers by providing tools, offers and education to help achieve a brighter financial future!  Customer feedback is strongly encouraged and heavily considered as well."
good,Been here almost 2 years and there no stopping my growth potential in the company. I started off as a collector and moved to the security department and now the sky is the limit as I have recently been promoted to a lead!
good,"*Inbound calls ranging from 80-100+ per day"
good,I would arrive at work. Get my breakfast and be a seated agent by start time. I would turn on my computer and phone waiting for the first caller and continue consecutive to next caller until my first break of the day. I used my breaks and lunch period to regroup with positive thoughts and people which I feel is so important. The difficult part of the job was an irate customer who would not calm down no matter how hard you tried to resolve their problem and the amount of time it would sometimes take to finally reach resolution. This would affect my average handle time in processing my calls but it all seemed to average at the end of the day.
good,friendly staff great benefits great place to meet amazing people the hardest part of the job is working the 2nd shift if you are not used to it

good,"Great place to work. Good people and culture. Would definitely work there again if the right opportunity came available. "
good,"Wonderful company with nice people, but average to below average pay. I find this strange for finance?! Campus is large, but very nice with a cafeteria and two smaller convenience locations. Generally, I am very happy here, with exception of salary."
good,The job was very relaxed with an great team and project mangers. Taught you how to manage and communicate with departments. The overall experience working there was excellent and I would love another opportunity if possible.

Assist with marketing meetings if requested.  Workplace culture was exciting and challenging.  There are some ping pong tables on the campus in one of the building."
good,"The workplace culture was very friendly and very engaged with employee activities, raffles etc. The hardest part was knocking out 10 hour consistent days to gain 40 hours. That part was draining with having to keep a upbeat attitude.The benefits were wonderful!! definitely showed how appreciative they were of their employees."
good,Very comfortable and easy going. Stressful work but laid back work environment. I've loved working at Discover Financial Services for the past 2 years.
good,"Work-life balance was well established. I felt that the company was really involved in the well-being of their employees. There was always some kind of acknowledgement, or award being given out. The workplace culture was great, and I could always find supportive coworkers. As far as the hardest part, was speaking to the customers. I enjoy the overall experience of helping customers feel financially well, and to provide the customer service they need. But, dealing with angry customers, was not something I enjoyed, but that is my own opinion."
good,"Enjoyed working for Discover.Great diverse culture and many opportunities for advancement.Very comfortable working environment but"
good,"I like that I can manage my day. There are times when you have to make adjustments based on business needs but I like that Discover generally doesn't throw something at you .  You're usually notified in advance, whenever possible."
good,I loved the company hated being on the phone though. I had a hard time being chained to a desk all day. Some of the phone calls were brutal and hard to take.
good,"If you are looking for a call center where support and empowerment is what you seek then look no further. Its a great workplace but however if a call center is not in your alley then it may not be for you, as it wasn't for me."
good,Great experience would highly recommend working at Discover awesome environment ! Big company they have great people to guide you and help you especially if it’s your first time working at a call center
good,"In the balance transfer department, it is a fun challenging job, but they force you to promote and go full time to customer service which stinks because the management is terrible and the job is much less enjoyable. I enjoyed being on the phone and helping people consolidate their credit cards though."
good,Discover is a great company to work. they do a lot of team building activities. from Luncheons to competitive games. not only that but they also give you one on one time for personal building
good,Excellent teamwork and collaboration between teams and their immediate supervisor. Only negative side was the micromanagement that occurred. As soon as you left your desk your scheduled break timer began.
good,"Overall fun place to work out, hard balancing school out tho. Great benefits, wages. The managers and everyone are awesome. Just slow at putting any requests in."
good,"Very faced paced work environment in very large busy call center, over 8 weeks of training at the onset, many computer programs are used daily and simultaneously to do the job, heavy phones and irate customers, but overall a good work environment."

good,"Show appreciation to employee had incentives.Result orient , they care about family and education.Always supporting the children and school.Bonus,good benefits."
good,"Overall a very good place to work. If you have previous call center experience, you're in for a serious upgrade in quality of life at work. Management was hands on, work place culture was very accepting of all creeds, religions, beliefs and social standings. Trainings and updates always provided to better job performance. A very nice team environment."
good,Discover is a good company to work for. But when it comes to pay and have time to get know your employees it's just not there. Also there just not enough time to do coaching or meetings.
good,Company encourages health wellness and includes all employees but not contractors. This was the only disappointing issue but understood since Contractors were employed by a third party company.
good,"I had worked with an amazing team.  We would all team up to help each other out, our monthly goals were always discussed daily.  The facility was amazing great company to work for.  Always meeting new people, with room for advancement.  The co-workers are the best, they make it very enjoyable, fun, challenging in positive ways.  Not every day will be great work wise, sometimes you have slow day's and sometimes you will be able to have great days."
good,"It was a call center. took calls everyday."
good,Discover card is a great culture and they make coming into work fun. They could be more competitive when it comes to pay though but over all the management and the co workers are really exceptional.

good,Discover makes customer service a high priority creating pride in ones position. The company also goes above and beyond in the treatment of employees. The training is smooth and prepares employees to exceed in their positions.
good,A typical day at work is refreshing as it makes you want to be a part of the company each and everyday. What I have learned at this company is patience of working with diverse customers throughout the day. The management at company is very professional as well as some of the co-workers. The hardest part of the job is getting in contact with customers being that I work in the collections department. The most enjoyable part is meeting my quota daily if possible.
good,Discover cards is an excellent company to work for.  They offer great benefits and is always willing to help you to reach your full potential.
good,Taking inbound calls for valued discover card customers. Balancing support of coworkers with one's own work. Management is dedicated and skilled and the overall worker vibe is positive. Hardest part of the job is the long walk downstairs to the cafe'.

good,Great management team and a great place to maintain work-life balance
good,"What you will immediately notice once you become part of the organization is a true and genuine focus on employee engagement and satisfaction. Management does a great job at ensuring that employees get what they need to be satisfied at work, and there is a true sense of belief in that if employees are happy, customers are happy."
good,"A typical day started at 7am, our department handled all inbound calls reguarding credit card statements, billing, finace charges and other question and concerns. On average we received about 75 calls per rep a day."
good,Been working here on a 10 month contract. Over the Last 10 months I have been nothing but happy. The staff I work with all seem to be great people. The people I have met while working here are some of the friendliest people ever. Seems to be a very good place to work. WIll miss working here once this contract is up.
good,"I worked for an extended part of my career with this company. This is where my sales experience and working with major accounts were first established. I would be the primary daily contact for a book of clients and problem solve or address any concerns, if any. Was proactive in order to keep the relationship with the clients on a retaining position."
good,Good company and willing to work with the employees. The environment was great and they respect the people. Work was enjoyable and not to demanding.

good,"Best work-life balance"
good,"Though there were some organization of work lapses, the experience as a summer intern was wonderful and ended with many return offers."
good,I loved working for discover but at the time I was going to school and the job became over whelming. now that I am finished with school I would love to go back

good,Working for Discover was one of the best work experiences in my lifetime. You really get the feel have family and some days are hard but it really was a joy to come into work everyday. I feel like the company has taught me in regards to how to handle certain situations. In all honesty I would love to go back there to work
good,Working at DFS has been and extra ordinary experience. They really make an effort to show they care and they are always there for you. I am handicapped and everyone is super inclusive and nice.
good,It has fun work environment with a supportive staff. The leadership is always there to help you whether its in your job or your own personal goals. They make sure they are giving you the tools you need.
good,"Great place to work, the downside is that some managers it’s their first management position so their overall understanding on what it takes to be a leader vs a boss is lacking."
good,"The management will put you in a position to succeed if you show the initiative.  Work can be a little frustrating depending on your business unit, but they are focusing on automation.  Always willing to let you work from home if you need to so appreciated the flexibility.  Would like maternity and paternity leave to be matched so mother and father can spend more time at home with the baby.  The hardest part of the job is all of the meetings that seem unnecessary.  It is hard to drive change to that mindset."
good,I really liked working for this company. Everyone was always in a great mood even though you were on the phones a majority of the day. Always activities and potlucks amongst the teams and you definitely felt appreciated.
good,"Taking calls from people wanting to close their accounts and working to keep their accounts open. Also some APR calls which people wanted a lower interest rate, so would help with achieving that goal"
good,Its a good company to work for great environment the management really wants to see you succeed and advance in the work place excellent pay and benefits.
good,"Ended up in a bad place via reorganization of Finance functions, so I left when I found another opportunity. Outside of this reorganization, I loved working at Discover.  A big company with a great spirit of team work."
good,"would not be looking around for another job is there were career advancement on my team.."
good,This is a great place to work and develop for anyone in the customer service field. They provide an inviting atmosphere and really work with people who have little to no experience. I had only really done warehousing before Discover and they helped me to become a great Account Manager in just one year.A typical day may include fielding up to 130 calls about credit cards and all the features surrounding them. Management is always looking to help people move up within the company.
good,"The call flow was manageable, there was a chance to learn something new every day. Management was supportive of their employees. There would be a peak of calls at times so there wouldn't be any coaches to help out a group of 30 new hires."
good,"they have good benefits for their employees.  A work out facility, discounts 4 wks of paid time off."
good,"They had a nice recognition package.  They had plenty of training that we could take.  Therefore, it helped with job knowledge and advancement.  Recognition for a job well done.  They keep the work in the United States, and you get someone on the phone after 1 minute."
good,Discover is an awesome job they work with your personal needs! Management are great they help you in anything! The most enjoyable part of the job is just working with the people around you!
good,"Great culture, great facilities "
good,"Good culture, great benefits but a bit low on pay. Good schedules and flexibility for a balance family oriented life, advancement opportunity is great company likes to promote within."
good,"it's just my standpoint, they don't prepare their employees for the mental stress in their collections department. It's given me depression and anxiety. I wish they had on site couseling."
good,"coworkers are amazing, everyone is nice and you have all the materials to succeed, and being able to have management to count on. but the call volume is very high and can be tiring if you do not like being on the phones all day, you do get some extremely rude card members that have no respect, but in any job you would have dissatisfied  customers. Discover is a great company itself though, rewards for employees, able to promote within 3 months of post."
good,It has been  to long since I worked at Discover card to provide and relevant information. While I worked there I like the company and the culture.   thank you
good,"I enjoyed working at Discover.  Threre are a lot of great benefits, it is a very nice facility with cafeteria, gym, hangout areas, they provide decent pay.  There was not much opportunity for advancement and some managers, just like anywhere, were not the best.  Not sure if they are still there even."
good,"You learn how to balance finances by fixing other peoples problems."
good,"Great facilities, great people to work with. I was appreciated and enjoyed my years at Discover Card, and had the opportunity to advance. When I asked to reduce my role, I was given the opportunity to step back into an hourly position."
good,Great place to work for. The culture at Discover was beyond what I expected when I started working here. Collaboration is key to be effective at your job.
good,"This is one of the most challenging positions I ever had. Tasked to create training using software I never used,  I was able to create engaging material for Account Executives located around the world. Although my position was a contract position,  I was treated like an employee. It was a great place to work."
good,"A very mid-west financial services that offers great work life balance. Lots of opportunity as the company expands it's offerings and products.Their salary, benefits, etc. match top companies in the financial services industry."
good,I wish they paid me more for being a supervisor but I did love everything else about the company. The atmosphere was great and people were nice. The customers are sometimes stressful to deal with.
good,"The pay was ok, they have a good benefit package. I found the schedule to be not flexable and very rigid in regards to work family balance. They have a 3 shift schedule available, they feed their employess often and they have a nice cafeteria with a variety of healthy and fast food options.  The postion I did was tedious and boring and they did their best to break up the boredom with meetings and activitys occasionally. Great people, nice management."
good,"This is a great place to work and a friendly environment. This company truly does care about its employees, and it shows. Benefits start from day one. The actual building has a great cafe, ungraded atmosphere and tech, and the aesthetic is nice. I truly enjoyed working for this company and it is my one regret leaving Discover."
good,Great company to work for. Good benefits and the ability to work from home was nice. The best part of the job was the people. Lots of motivation and friendly faces.
good,"I absolutely love how awesome Discover is to their employees.  great pay, great benefits, always doing contest, free food, free things, game days.  Had full service cafe for breakfast and lunch, light dinner, and 24/7 market place.  Willing to work schedules around school, kids, life in general.  Discover was all about promoting development with their employees.  Discover absolutely is true when they say ""we treat you like you'd treat you."""
good,"The company is a positive place to work, with good benefits and good leadership. There are work from home options for most employees, plus a downtown location for convenience. The food options on campus seem to be at least somewhat subsidized for employees, with a fairly good selection of food for breakfast and lunch. The company also supports volunteer opportunities and seems to genuinely want to give back."
good,team members are friendly just didn't like the sales part friendly and clean enviroment   perfect training process  one of the best training places I have worked at
good,"You log onto your computer. You have metrics for all of your on call time and break time. You take call after call for the duration of your shift. At times can be taken off the phone for coaching or team events. Your main focus is on keeping the card member happy with you and Discover. Long walks from the parking lot to your desk. Long walks to get food."
good,It's a great place to work for those who enjoy the corporate environment. There is room for advancement and the people are nice. I would highly recommend Discover as a place to start a new career.
good,You're able to hearing music while working as long as you are focused and don't spend much time on your work. Help is around when you are having a difficult time balancing a case if its from management or peers someone is always there to help.

I searched all over in Washington for a Discover but was sadly concluded that there was not one up here. awesome people, management, and environment. I learned how to speak in phones, work the computer system and type."
good,"The hardest part of the job is being on the phone all day. Other than that, great management and atmosphere. I did enjoy working here and the people were great."
good,Accepted inbound calls working with customer retention and escalation. Worked as a mentor to co-workers with daily tasks such as statement and account review as needed.
good,Fun work enviroment with supportive management. Not all about numbers but how you grow and develop. One of the top companies to work for in Arizona.
good,"Each day at work I learn something new from a customer or from management on things that are changing or that have changed. We take hundreds of calls a day and do it day after day. the hardest part of this job is the situations that you face very rarely and may not have all the answers to, but the answers are easy to find within minutes and management and other co-workers are always willing to help find and provide the answer to the situation."
good,"My first experience at a call center, I had a lot to learn.  The hardest part of the job was collecting money from college students who couldn't find a job in the field they graduated in."

good,"Client Services is rewarding, and the staff is exceptional."
good,"I worked on the phones taking calls. I worked mostly in the retention department, trying to keep people with their accounts. I loved my job. I was very good at it.

They could get really hostile when you called them."

They had long training classes that lastes weeks however, these did set you up for success with the company and making sure you were ready to be on the phones. The management is great as well they want you to be the best you can be!"
good,"You start work with a roughly 2 week paid training period, which I going to be honest is kinda boring, but once you begin work it's a blast, the work is a bit stressful if you don't know what you are doing but there's always somebody nearby who can answer your questions and you can always put the customer on hold. The culture at the workplace is Amazing, never had a bad time working there, the building is great too with a large parking lot, lake right by the facility and a dedicated cafeteria, gym, and mental health care office. Discover genuinely cares about their employees and will never leave you feeling overwhelmed, the work is a little bit stressful and hard at first but you are surrounded by wonderful people who are willing to help you learn and are forgiving of mistakes."

good,"Good place to work"
good,Collections at Discover Card is a very unique place to work. You have the chance to take your time with all customers you talk to. They have great programs that make doing your job way easier. Hardest part of the job is getting your hours switched to work around your life outside of work. There are a lot of changes that happen but they do give you the tools needed to transition easily though.
good,"If you dont mind call centers its a great place to work. You will deal with upset customers at least once a day but these calls can always be escalated to supervisors. Great benefits, employees are regularly given extra rewards such as bags and travel mugs, ect. easy to advance within the company."

good,"If you are willing to work in a call center environment and work your way through the company, this is the place for you! Workplace culture is beyond amazing, but the type of work required is not for everyone. The company does a lot for its employees to make the work more enjoyable."
good,A typical day at work was like any other except as time goes by from making all your friends and from advancing the pace really starts to feel more like a second home.
good,"Great company all around the management is amazing, the culture is fantastic and all of your co-workers are quite pleasant to be around. Discover has many different opportunities to advance with all the tools that you need to get there."
good,"Discover truly cares about their employees and was always working hard to ensure employee and customer satisfaction.  I worked with a wonderful team of people.  Although it was fast paced, it was both challenging and fun.  Would highly recommend for anyone looking for a fun, challenging and fast paced position."
good,"Get in sign in, take calls. I learned how to build professional relationships with customers, the managers were a great help and very fun to be around, the environment was very relaxed, the hardest part about the job was getting past that very first phone call right out of training, the most enjoyable part of the job was working with the very same group of people in your training class."
good,I learned how to handle stressful situations and improve with my personal life as well. The hardest thing about the job was how high the expectations were than I thought and keeping up with high stats.
good,I would arrive at work at noon and receive calls from customers and help them transfer balances from other accounts to ours at a lower rate so they would save money.
good,The employment was awesome but the various managers could use additional training.  The professionalism wasn't equal to all of awesome things about Discover.
good,My time at Discover financial services has been wonderful and was a contract position. I enjoyed being a part of the team and helping people get rid of their debt. The functions we had at the company were very involving and the company gave back to the community.
good,"Nice work culture"
good,"Credit card industry has a large moat, is highly consolidated, and has sophisticated players. Discover has an inclusive and consensus oriented culture, with a focus on people development."
good,"Pay isnt too great but this company is wonderful. They are all about their employee and family. They have yearly picnis, special events and great incentives. If I didnt have to leave to make more money I swear I would still work there. Very easy to move up if your willing to work hard. Great employees as your peers. Love this place"
good,The pay and benefits are amazing. The culture is so fun. They do what they can to make the work enviroment fun and keep employees motivated and engaged.
good,"Great Benefits, good potential for advancement. Family like atmosphere. Company stayed current with trends in the industry. Would recommend employment here to a friend"
good,"Discover offers amazing benefits, my pay rate started at around $12 an hour which was really amazing for me. You have the opportunity to move up in positions really fast. I had only been working at Discover for 2 months and then they promoted me up to a higher level of collections. The people that work at Discover are so friendly and you will make so many friends it unbelievable. Management is great they always make sure that you get one on one time to connect with Team Leaders and coaches, they really get to know you and help you achieve your goals. The only negative thing I would have to say about working here is just what I do. Keep in mind that collections is not for everybody, I am just not an aggressive person and I get stressed out easily when customers hang up on me. The team leaders and coaches have always worked with me and answered any questions that I have, they are always there for everybody. Also we are allotted 20 days of pto each year which is great."
good,"It was a blast working for Discover.  The management was Helpful, I have created lifetime friendships with my co-workers. Training was top notch, and well structured."
good,"Great benefits and bonus potential. The open and fun culture was a great surprise when i started, and I'll definitely miss it. I wish there was a location where I'm relocating!"
good,A wonderful company I would refer to for those who are interested in trying the financial industry. Discover is a great company that cares for both their employees and their guests.
good,"Discover treats their employees really well. They understand how hard the job can be sometimes and do everything they can to help get you through the day with a good attitude. They strive on career advancement and help you achieve yours goals by helping you on the job and also offering extra training and classes to improve. I learned how to effectively speak to customers and solve problems quickly and efficiently. Working for Discover also taught me a lot about self pride and how important it is to always set goals to better yourself, life and career. All the employees at Discover that I had the privilege of working along side with were very kind and always willing to help. Its hard not to have a smile on when you work at Discover even with some of those pesky calls that can be encountered. The hardest part of the job was trying to calm down the highly emotional customers (angry, upset, etc) and find an effective way to understand whats going on and help them fix the problem. To be honest the work days at Discover were pretty easy to enjoy and get through with a good mood. Discover treats their employees like family, making it a comfortable, productive and happy environment."
good,Discover has many career opportunities available. My management teams were always understanding and willing to work you. Great working environment.
good,"I enjoyed everything,  the people, the concepts and activities.   I did not like that we are required to work holidays and weekends.   I have a family at home and I want to be there when they are."
good,"•	Work with customers that have fallen past due in making payments to their account. Use professional and persuasive communication skills as well as strive to keep the goodwill of our customers."

good,Discover Financial Services is a great company to work for. Great benefits and working atmosphere.
good,"I love this company, they definitely know how to take care of their employees."
good,"nice place to be and enjoy co wokers but, not for me as far as working goes"
good,"Colleagues are very motivated and equipped with professional knowledge. Learned a lot from them and senior leadership."
good,"- You answer phone calls and assist clients with payments and account questions.  In the Marketing department we focused on sales for Discover's four main products they offered (they no longer offer these products).  After they stopped selling these products I was promoted to Discover Student Loans department where I became a bankruptcy specialist.  For this position I would receive bankruptcy documents from our clients attorneys and I would alter their account to reflect the bankruptcy.  Depending on the chapter of bankruptcy the clients filed I would submit a ""Proof of Claim"" against the client to the bankruptcy court in which the client filed in."
good,Just a wonderful plae to work and to grow as a employee. The managers and the company all were willing to give you a great work and family balance. There was always a sense of caring about their employees and wanted everyone to succeed.
good,"To identify and secure a challenging sales/customer service position where I can use my"
good,"Great company, great culture! The people at Discover are among the best. The enviornment is playful yet challenging. I would recommend Discover to everyone!"
good,"I like my Co-workers"
good,I absolutely loved working here! I just could not afford the pay
good,Employees are valued at Discover! Training to help keep your skills up to date provided on a regular basis. Team work is key. Supportive peers from the top to the bottom.
good,I learned a lot about customer service. The hardest part is my current schedule and the fact that they cant change it. Co-workers were great. Made a lot of friendships there.
good,"- Typical day is addressing customer requests due to APRs, closure requests, and also promoting usage."
good,"Focused on delivery to merchants and customers, growing into new technology and markets, market and technology driven with care to compliance and security."
good,"I loved my job at DFS, I would still be there if it were not for my becoming disabled and unable to work full time."
good,"Discover Financial Services is a great company to work for. They offer amazing benefits such as a starting bank of 25 PTO (Paid Time Off) days, 401K, employee stock purchase plan, onsite fitness center and Physicians Assistant. They offer a wide variety of health plans and pay up to $60 per month for public transportation costs, while also providing a shuttle to and from local train stations. If I wasn't relocating to another state, I would stay at Discover for many years to come!"
good,"Encouraging, enlightening, great team-builders, balanced work-life environment, very professional, yet casual and personable associates and staff."
good,"Friendly work environment, work at home opportunity, room for advancement, college reimbursement program.  Learned customer service skills and how to analyze credit. Great management team. Enhanced people development and communication skills.  Learned alot about regulations and compliance laws."

good,Discover invest a lot of money into its employees. Besides the regular benefits Discover provides a lot of regular large scale activities for its employees.
good,"you  work with people who care about your success, 20 paid days off + 7 holidays off you cannot complain. They always give you free food, and have really fun events."
good,"Overall, I really liked Discover Financial Services! The culture they've built in the Phoenix Office is great. There's a cafeteria, game area, rewards for top performers, etc. They really pride themselves on having a fun, uplifting culture. I was able to work in multiple areas in CSE, and I enjoyed different things about each area. If you have a phone position, you can expect to be pretty busy on the phones. They do teach excellent customer service skills if you choose to follow them. The hardest part on a phone job is being extremely busy and dealing with the customers that are really rude. Most of the customers are super nice (especially if you give them great customer service), but you'll get the ugly too. There is a lot of opportunity for growth and great benefits like tuition reimbursement. I also loved how, once I was a team coach, I was able to begin taking more professional development classes. These classes taught me a ton of skills that I still use in my everyday life. I would definitely work here again."
good,"Pros"
good,"I believe this is the best Call Center I have worked for when it comes to having fun in a high stressed competitive job. I've worked for multiple call centers in my 15+ years of call center work. "
good,"Discover is not only a top notch employer but they also truly go above and beyond as a company to be socially and environmentally conscious, which elevates the, above many other banks both for customers and for employees in my opinion. Wish I still lived in the city, I never would have left if we hadn’t moved!"
good,"Discover was a fantastic place to intern over the summer.  From managers that genuinely care about your career growth and put you in a position to work on high-impact projects to a warm and friendly culture, this is an excellent firm to start and/or grow your career."
good,"I love the people you work with and the benefits are phenomenal! Being in the phones 8 hours a day is so incredibly demanding emotionally and that was very difficult for me to continue doing for 3 years. They have tons of recognition, job advancement, different jobs roles you can apy for within."
good,"I enjoyed 90% of my work experience at this job. It says a lot to your customers when they are greeted by a smile on the other line. You can hear a smile you know. "
good,Discover is by far the best place I've ever worked. The coaches set you up for success and they REALLY do care about you. The training is fantastic and they have great tools to help you succeed.
good,"Tons of opportunity for advancement."
good,An AWESOME place to work! Wish they were located on the East Coast. All kinds of people work there. One of the best jobs I have ever worked! Benefits are AMAZING!
good,I worked at their Louisville branch for the three years that they had a home loan division.  I learned a lot and it was very helpful.  My only negative is that they only gave our division a few years to succeed.
good,Excellent team work environment.  Ability to interface in various areas of the company.  Company expected a good job and then rewarded when the job was exceeded.
good,"Discover was such an amazing place to work, it was by far one of the best places of employment I have ever had. If I didn't move out of the state I would have stayed at Discover for a long period of time. You could really tell how much their employees meant to them."
good,Discover really values its employees and allows you to have a life outside of the 40 hour work week. Rarely are you going to be working more than 40 hours a week.
good,Excellent place to work. Very supportive management.  Very good benefits. Very good team mates. Very beautiful campus with running trails around.  Best places to work.
good,Great job. Fun place to work. Co-workers and management became life long friends. Great pay if you work hard and remain teachable. Company deeply cares about employees ability to grow.
good,"Great company to work for, flexible and opportunities for promotion are available. Strong emphasis on performance based statistics. Great employee benefits. Discover Card is always reward their employees thru food or prizes. Work is consistent and sometimes can be challenging."
good,"I have actually learned so much working for Discover Financial Services including but not limited to, how to address others in difficult situations with empathy, kindness and willingness to solve the problem if possible and if not direct them to my supervisor in which they may be able to solve the situation. I have also learned how to properly and efficiently work with team members and have fun at work! Discover Financial Services treats their employees like family !"
good,"Discover is an excellent company, the management is very aware and committed to training and development of all employees.  My experiences there were outstanding."
good,It was mostly getting on the phones and answering customer questions and payments of course they pushed client relationships was most important while we had meeting and such it did get stressful wish they paid more
good,"I absolutely LOVED everything about Discover. The only downside was that I had a supervisor that was insanely dramatic, and kept her ""favorites"" close to her. Other than that, the atmostphere was amazing, all of the other supervisors were awesome, and acknowledged the hard workers."
good,it was a very nice work enviorement was very calm and the day was good I think this job was fair because you could work mornings and evenings and not just one or the other
good,I was very happy with the atmosphere and opportunity I had there. The only reason I left was due to some outside forces and with the job being high customer experience based I wasn’t able to fufill my job for the time being. They were flexible and attentive to me and I enjoyed my time there thoroughly. I created great friendships and connections and I hope to eventually be apart of the company again!
good,"Discover was a wonderful place to work. I've considered going back many times. Excellent benefits, great people and they more than compensate for it being a somewhat rough job (collections isn't always fun)."
good,"I absolutely loved working for discover and would recommend it to anyone. I worked in customer care / APR so we had to have some tough conversations with our customers about why their APR increased and how they can decrease the amount (and I knew nothing about APR and accounting until I started working here). All of the supervisors I had were amazing in their own way. Discover is all about growth. So if you put in the work you will go far and fast. Upper management is great and they really do value your feedback and suggestions are always taken into consideration. You are also not on the phone constantly because at least once or twice a day your supervisor or team lead will take you off the phone to listen to some of your phone calls and give you feedback on how you can improve and tell you what you did good at and sometimes your whole team will go for meetings to listen to phone calls and come up with ways to improve your customer service, which makes sense because I have a discover card and customer service is on point. Discover is always doing small things for their employees like having raffles, pizza parties, pot lucks, and games to do inbetween calls and breaks. They also give a lot of employees ""VIP"" which is where you get special treatment on a daily basis as long as you keep your numbers high and your reviews are good. This is definitely a call center that I never dreaded going to. If I ever go back to a call center again, discover would be the place to go."
good,I give it a thumbs up.  I enjoyed the many departments that consistently had opportunities to transfer or advance.  Promotions were plentiful and they rewarded hard work.
good,"Nice work environment, overall goo experience. Im looking for something that offers more opportunities! I really did enjoy Discover, but my job was very simple, I feel like I can handle more and was told by my manager I was ready to move up in the business, but unfortunately it never happened."
good,"Discover Financial Services was a great place to work. The environment was satisfying and competitive. You were responsible for meeting sales goals, and were coached on how to meet said goals."
good,Nice place to work.  There is team work everywhere and a very flexible work environment.  There are rooms for telephone conversations and conference rooms with white boards and large screen TVs for displaying your laptop screen for presentations or for work groups.
good,"Been working for DFS for about 4 years and could not be more pleased considering this is the banking industry.  The flat/lateral management concept is fantastic for trying to get changes made, there is no fear of going above someone's head.  "
good,"Discover is a great place to work! While at times it was stressful, the company really takes care of their employees!  They had a great cafeteria in the building, along with a fitness center, a nurses office for basic sickness and even an atm.  Had great benefits, pay and paid time off.  They provide a really good training program for their employees."
good,Discover was a great place to work! I wish they wold have an office in Florida so i can continue working for them. Great opportunity for advancement and great system of acknowledgement and praise to their employees.
good,"They are on the Top 100 places to work for a reason.  You feel like you are appreciated at Discover, with a ton of ways to advance through the company.  One thing that I appreciated the most was the extensive training.  They don't just throw you in with the sharks hoping you can swim.  They take there time and invest in your development with an extensive training class when starting.  Great place to work."
good,"3 weeks of on-site training and tons of one-on-one mentorship before you get thrown into the rush prepares you THOROUGHLY! I felt so at home in my cubicle after such a quick time just because of how much it felt like a family environment and I felt valued as an employee and person. I would recommend anyone take the opportunity to work for this company. They are absolutely top of the line. Unfortunately due to pregnancy complications I was released without prejudice as an employee, but I do plan on returning sometime in the future."
good,"I love working at Discover! This is absolutely my favorite place I've worked. They have the best benefits, pretty good pay, great incentives, they treat their employees very well, and their management is wonderful! The only reason I am looking for a different job is because I need more money and we aren't hiring in positions that I qualify for or that pays more than Iam making. Otherwise, I would NOT leave!"
good,"Excellent place to work. Pay is not the best. However, the company does take care of their employees and makes it fun. It's not always about the money."
good,"With Discover, I always felt like everyone knew everyone, even though there were over a thousand people working there. It was just that friendly of an environment to work in. I felt as though the management, and trainers were very helpful and fun to be around, making work fun to go to every day. This was the most enjoyable part of working there. The only downfall was it was the same thing every day. Not much time for meetings and trainings in our department. Phone time all the time. Other than that, the room for growth and company itself was awesome."
good,"Good people, fun environment, everyone is very helpful. Management was very hands on, they were understanding about needing time off as well. Training was very helpful."
good,"Discover card is a wonderful place to work, you'll find that just about every manager you run into is qualified, personable and professional. if you needed help from anyone at any time of day someone is there within minutes, the systems are constantly kept up to date and you are provided with everything you need to be successful."
good,Discover is an top notch employer.  The appreciate & reward good service.  The facilities are outstanding.  Their training is good.  Discover wants your personality to shine through.  They acknowledge excellence both privately and publicly.

good,The workplace was great and the CEO was so much fun. He kept our busy mortgage office fun to come to each day. Always made sure we were accommodated for - The culture was great and this was during the depression of the mortgage business and I was the last employee with him - went from 20 employees down to myself and him.
good,I love this job. I've never had any issues with management or anything.  The pay is great for what we do. I enjoy going to work everyday. The best job I've had by far.
good,"Great place to work, great culture.  Great opportunities for growth and advancement.  Management consist of both long time employees and new managers."
good,"Discover Financial Services is a great company! My job specifically wasn't easy and very stressful. There is opportunity for advancement and the work culture is very easy going, and they want to see you succeed."
good,I never thought I would like collections. I especially didn't think I would be there for 4 years! I was also majority of the time the top collector in my department!. Who would have known. We also had contests where we had prizes. I won a lot of drawings.
good,"I enjoyed working at Discover. It had a great environment around it, from the inside to the outside. The reason I left though was because my TL had approved a newer employee's request to change her shift when I had asked before her as well as I had been working for discover for a year, and unfortunately for my new family I had to leave."
good,"Awesome place to work at, they walk you step by step through everything. Great benefits and great opportunities to advance within the workplace. Really good culture where everyone is accepted for who they are without being judged."

good,"I handle all credit card inquiries from taking payments to initiating merchant disputes."
good,Discover is a great place to work. I worked there for two years and never met a manager or co-worker that I didn't like. They have an amazing cafeteria but it only accepts cash or a discover card. There are TVs and Foosball tables in the break rooms. I would definitely recommend anyone looking for a job to apply.
good,Learned how to communicate with customers very effectively.
good,"	Information was gathered from the client regarding existing SharePoint 2010\2013."

good,"Id love to work at Discover if they had a sales floor, however during my time I took fraud prevention calls so it really wasn't my thing. I recommend working here for young kids in school or people who like working in customer service type work"

good,"constant improvements and great environment Discover is focused on keeping their Employee's happy, because when the employee is happy the customer is also."
good,I had to leave Discover because I moved out of state but it honestly broke my heart because the the strong relationships I developed with my entire department including my DM. Expect weekly coachings on how you can improve and how they can help and an overall check on how everything is going in your life. They genuinely want their employees to be happy at work and do everything they can to contribute to that. There are metrics to be met but I always strived to meet them because how you perform reflects on your team also.

good,Discover is very fast and easy to work with I had an interview and then got offered the job.  I loved working there but I had a family death and that’s why I quit
good,"Great experience, family oriented. Everyone felt involved in the day to day decision making. Managers have a very open door policy and are very understanding"

good,"Really sad to be leaving this company but I am relocating. My job at Discover can be described as a relaxed yet competitive setting- it all depends on your personal goal. It offers amazing benefits which is what draws many people in, but it's the environment that keeps them. They are pretty reasonable and understanding about your personal situations and will try to make it work even with a fixed schedule. There are opportunities to grow or try something new. "
good,"My day was spent working with each of my representatives on everything from coaching calls to increasing their job knowledge and preparing them for promotions. I learned very early on that taking care of your employees by recognition and getting them involved in the decision making process gives them a sense of ownership. Upper management supported what and how we took care of our employees which promoted a sense of teamwork and group wins when we had challenging goals to reach. The work culture was one of ""yes we can"" and it was evident at every month end. The hardest part about the job was watching skilled employees leave the team to go onto better positions. It was also enjoyable to see employees who worked very hard achieve the success they wanted from themselves."

good,"Already the  third largest issuer of credit cards in the US and growing rapidly focused on latest technology and customer service."
good,"If you get your foot into the door after interviews, congratulations, you are ABSOLUTELY lucky! It is severely competitive to obtain work for Discover. However, in case you're wondering what it could be like, here's what I can share. Training is 4 weeks, 2 in class, 2 in hands-on. After training, you can expect a class award ceremony (seriously, they love to make you feel great about the work you're doing...even if it leaves you feeling slightly embarrassed afterwards). From there, most of your class will stay together (unless you advance before you leave training or decide to change departments), working for a new coach/trainer. Expect lots of feedback throughout the workweek, ESPECIALLY what you can do better the next time you get a similar call (great for those seeking constant reassurance that they are doing great...or terribly). If you stay around long enough, or work weekends, lunch is on them (usually pizza or subs; ice cream party days when we beat our competitors at something). Even if you don't stay long, the snack cart is always SOMEWHERE nearby, or if you don't feel like waiting, there's a lady who will exchange a snack, provided you answer a question correctly. Your Trainers/leads believe in you and your talents. They. REALLY. do! So much so, you'll get a compliment about a call you did well a good three times daily (again, the reassurance. Positive reinforcement is key!). Of course if you don't like being bragged upon or don't like compliments, you can always ask them to back down a little bit. If you are in general customer service, call volume isn't bad (except"

The bosses are very nice and understand that things seem repetitive and are very nice about it and helpful with things.

good,"A typical day at work is greeting your friendly co workers, arriving to your desk where you log on and get a headset on, ready to speak to customers over the phone. Overall a great job to be at, for the benefits, the atmosphere, the pay. The hardest part would have to be the customers themselves, for some are very irate or frustrated, but that's part of the job, and they provide you excellent training and resources to interact with those types of cardmembers. The management is amazing and they always have you in mind. The only downside I find with this job is having to be on the phone for an extended amount of time, sitting at a desk. For some that is heaven, but for an overly active person as myself, I do not find it very enjoyable. The experience I've had so far working for this company has been nothing short of excellent."
good,Discover is a great place to work. they start you out low but its easy to build up and go other places. I recommend working there because they really do treat you right.
good,"The managers and team leaders were very helpful and knowledgeable. They are always on the phone along with everyone else screening and monitoring each individual team members to see if they're needing assistance with members inquiries, etc. If you're stuck and don't know what to do or say, you can just raise your hand and they'll either walk over to you and help you with your call or they'll just plug themselves onto your current call and listen to it while sending you chats about what you could do or say to assist members. They were very convenient to have a restaurant in the building, as well as their very own gym with certified trainers !!! I loved working there."

Discover takes care of their employees.  .  It is an excellent company to work for.  They care about your career development and where you want to go in the company.
good,I loved working at Discover. They taught you everything you needed to learn about credit cards and the services they offer. By the time I was done training and ready to take calls I was very confident. There was a lot of support for if we needed assistance. The trainers and managers and co- workers were amazing and very nice. The culture in this work environment was very diverse. It was an overall great place to work. I have nothing bad to say.

good,Unfortunately I did move somewhere else and didnt want to leave Discover Card. Overall it was a fantastic company that actually cares about their employees and their company advancement. They train you really well stuff I had no idea about and I came out of there knowing a lot about banking and credit cards. The culture there is great they accept everyone and support a lot of human rights. You get a ton of free goodies food and selfie sticks and all that jazz
good,Discover was a great job for me. I started after attempting to double major at a university to find out that I was no longer interested in my majors nor was I ready for that. I moved up very quickly and made great money. I made life long friends and I would go back if I find myself living near a Discover in the future.
good,"I joined DFS in August, 2015 as a fresher and fortunately, I am going to leave it in few days. There are not much pros. After thinking hard, I was able to come across with few of them."

No one is a stranger for long and people are genuinely happy to be at work. There is always some form of employee appreciation going on.
