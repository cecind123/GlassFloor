bad,I worked for them for 17 years and went thru 7 layoffs and finally got laid off. I had a supervisor who humiliated me in front of all of my co-workers and I turned them in to HR who did absolutely nothing to them and another supervisor when my brother passed away I was told to leave my problems at home and not to bring them at work. Then they falsified documentation against me in order to lay me off as they do with all their employees. They talk a good game about caring about their employees but treat them terrible. They work you to death and pile on as much stuff as they can than so you do the job of three people and you don't get decent raises for killing yourself and all the time the ones who kiss their supervisors butt are the ones who make it there until they get tired of you.  Raises have nothing to do with how good your work is but how good you kiss butt. I guess the good thing is that both these supervisors were laid off too.
bad,Extremely stressful.  Management's evaluation and performance review process is the worst I've experienced. Career advancement opportunities are limited.  Difficult to get promoted.
bad,"They will use you like toilet paper, then flush you when done. Absolutely NO JOB SECURITY. There is no logic to decisions, and you don’t know from day to day... literally you get to work and wonder if you will be walked out because ZERO stability. Stay away."
bad,"12.5 hour days, 9 in the bunny suit in the f ab were brutal. Even the veteran employees were dragging by the fourth day in a row doing that. "
bad,"all they care about is numbers, don't work there. It's a very stressful job especially if you aren't a regular employee. They do not treat temps the same."
bad,People talked bad about each other. Management was always on vacation and if it wasn’t about their life then they really didn’t care to help you advance and better yourself. They didn’t follow the missions and values that the co pant wants everyone to follow.
bad,"Don't go in expecting to be treated fairly or with respect. Contract workers are viewed as ""less than"" and treated like scum. They are the lowest of the low and you will have no doubt where you rank while you're there. If the company sponsors any celebrations expect to be excluded. Whether it is as simple as cake or donuts or more extravagant where the entire team gets up to go out to lunch or leaves all day to go to ""team building"" and leaves you sitting there without a word to you as to what is going on and why everyone is leaving. Management are the most arrogant creatures I have ever met and I am an experienced person with 20+ years of workplace experience. The managers spend an hour in the morning talking about what the spent a $500 dinner on or the shopping trip they had last night where they bought $250 shoes, and the model of Cadillac they drive. It's disgusting and I am so glad to be out of there."
bad,"Only the paranoia will keep you awake in this morass of boredom and political landmines."
bad,"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WORKING FOR INTEL, "
bad,management changes a lot and always busy that there is not time to learn new skills or get trained........................................................
bad,"Over a year of my life was wasted working at this company.  They do not know what they are doing, it shows as they keep losing market share.  The employees appear to be happy but don't always follow through on promises"
bad,"Very good learning experience."
bad,"I never worked for Intel, I only worked there with Nstar Global Services for Tokyo electron. with the IPRO Team to preform system upgrades on the Dry etchers and to assist with low level PM 's and troubleshoot tool down issues."
bad,Great company that treats its people with respect. Great product. Great people. Willing to let people take initiative and otherwise grow in their fields. Willing to allow people to explore other roles in the company.
bad,"Not much work life balance. 12+ hours typical work day. "
bad,"I am not happy where i am now and its very stressful job i ever had. They say they have open policy to talk, but that's not true about  it. I am just not satisfy"
bad,"Intel requires a lot from all of it's workers. very fast pace and lots of stress with budgets and deadlines. you will learn a lot quickly, but will also burn out quickly too."
bad,"my work place is good environment and good employers.                   "
bad,"Terrible place to work"
bad,The place sucks. Age discrimination  is embedded here and they will lay off contractors 2 days before christmas after 2 months of a 6 month contract. Avoid
bad,"Cannibalistic work environment. Chaotic management with no real understanding of human interaction. "
bad,"Scam - bad management, no promotions, poor raises, no meritocracy, very political, dying company due to no-good leadership; coasting on old achievements."
bad,"I have had good and bad at Intel.  However, it is a very political organization and you can find your performance go from ""exceeding"" to ""Improvement Requirement"" within weeks to months of leaving an organization or getting a new manager if there is a hiring freeze.  After leaving, I found that Intel appears to lay off a lot of people prior to the 7 year anniversary, when they would have accrued a paid sabbatical. All in all, it's a mixed bag."
bad,"Intel Used to care about the employees, but there new interest is get it done no matter what the cost, they constantly lay off people regardless of how much effort or work they have put in to the company, and if they don't like you or if your ideas push them to new heights of thinking they are quick to dismiss you."
bad,Encouraged RCGs to create scripts for product and tool health monitoring and provide the customized output in daily managerial . Intel is not a good company to work for.
bad,"Intel used to be good company to work for but it turned into very toxic environment of backbiting and back stabbing. Moral was hit hard, management were clueless and helpless"
bad,Poor Management that leads to frustration and good people leaving either the team or the company. The experience is very dependent on the Head of the Team so the generic Intel culture does not trickle down.
bad,"A lot of walking and mandatory overtime, No down time or perks, just don't miss work or want to take a day off.  You are asked to work non stop and are frowned on if you don't."
bad,"This is an awful place to work, with just plain too many managers.  There are too many employees that lack the very basics their job requires, one would think that this is a place filled with highly motiviated and very smart workers, its not. Stay away!!!!!"
bad,The environment is work overload and it is not a great place to work.  the compensation is below industry standards for most all employees except sr. management.
bad,"If you like the American Dream go for it. This is a completely soul sucking cultureless company. Go work for Amazon, google, Microsoft. All pay better and have better company culture."
bad,Boss played the fiddle and drank while the billing dept burned. Was given full time status but then when others quit as soon as i was full time every task was given to me. Only coworker was in his 70s and slow worker. Others in department but kept tasks to minimum and literally went to lunch all day with boss.
bad,A very competitive environment where everyone watches out for themselves and does not promote on hard work and skills.  More political than proper leadership.
bad,"Intel is a great place and culture to work for. As a group, we work very well together and with a family atmosphere. Very flexible schedule and no micro management style."
bad,"Too many double standards. No fun when working. More and more expected of a worker yet no incentive, or wage increase offered.The shift rotation is too hard to maintain a proper home life."
bad,commodity manager with minimum bachelor degree are not allowed to fire engineer phd..bad bad company.. bk is rebublican sucks... they give good money to buy you
bad,installed desks. I learned how to put desks together. management gave false promised of raises and hours. hardest part was having no work for months at a time. enjoyable part was making friends.
bad,"they r all back stabers  management is 2 faced "
bad,"A chip maker that develops software, too. Most of the time, there's either too much or too little work to do. Has good cafeteria food. There's a lot of blue and white. Cubicles are getting shorter."
bad,I have learned so many thing in this company and its a good working place.I just can't work due to travel to far from penang to Kulim.
bad,The company is full of 3rd world citizens in their fifties caring only to maintain their job-salary. Useless politics.
bad,"I got laid off after I was out on medical leave due to a work related injury. Management was not fair on our support team."
bad,Intel recycles contractors all the time.  You have to wait six months to return.  They seem that not paying benefits and having to retrain contractors is saving them money.  Employees get free coffee in the cafeteria; contractors have to pay.
bad,Worst place to work! Back stabbing and nepotism are running rampant. I'm surprised that a company as large as Intel is run like this.
bad,"Regular over time, lack of growth, too many employees rewarded for lack of work, while overworked employees become overlooked."
bad,"At most companies, 90% of the people you get along with, and 10% make your life miserable.  At Intel, it's more like 70% you get along with, 30% make your life miserable.  One of those 30% is definitely going to be your manager."
bad,"The most back stabbing environment I ever worked in! Lacked management support, sabotage my leadership and disrespected my background and experiences."
bad,Not a great place to work. Intel pays 75% of market and works employees hard. The people are not treated well and the culture of the last few years has changed and continued to get worse.
bad,"As a contractor you eill immediately find Intel segragates its Intel employees from its contractors.  Great culture right?  Blue badges are Intel green badges are contractors.  I consider it racist and segregated myself hense green card.  We are immigrants.  Intel employees recieve free beverages gym use and general sence of superiority.  Most blue badges wont even acknowledge you if you say good morning to them.  Real nice right? "
bad,"Intel lay off good employees frequently. Their annual review requires peer reviews, which is useless because manager's review determines all. Culture is too aggressive."
bad,"As a contractor, you get to sit around and watch as ""goodies"" are spread around to employees. Parties, gifts, other benefits. It's depressing to watch."
bad,"Intel has the desire for change for as long as I can remember.  However the ability to trust, have open honest communication without retaliation, the will to listen to new ideas that have been tested/proven without discrimination will put Intel on the elite list again."
bad,management lays off people right before Christmas to get an extra bonus for lower head count.. they call it lean manufacturing but actually means they lay off full time workers and hire temps to get trained to do the job.. then instead of hiring those trained workers they kick them to the curb and make the full time perm.employees train another group of temps again and again.  This is not the Intel it used to be... thanks B.K.
bad,"Do not wish to respond, all answers to all questions null and void."
bad,"I experienced incompetent managers, people who took credit for your work, harassment, ""do as I say, not as I do"" managers, managers who were quick to deny issuing the orders they issued, and unclear instructions on what to do."
bad,"After multiple re-orgs in a single year, I'm fed up with this place.  Management can't agree on what is and isn't important so the entire organization is in constant chaos.  The people that really suffer or the rank and file employees."
bad,"Terrible backstabbing and cutthroat. Security Managers are angry, hostile, and mean. The old school employees are unskilled and incompetent, however they know the art of the thirty second commercial in reporting work that others are doing as their own by reading work from weekly status emails, and attending meetings just to listen to the hard workers and act like they are doing the work."
bad,"Everyday I went to work to find a new set of challenges, but first I had to research and identify them. Had to formulate plans to achieve department goals. Needed to hand out the duty assignments for my 13 man operation. "
bad,"Not a great place, as the company has become rudderless and treats employees as its asset but rather disposable. No solid technology/product road map for the future. No integrity, honesty and doing what is right for the shareholders. Culture of favoritism and nepotism; Poor management style - once career growth is depends on who you know rather than your performance. Weak middle management. Younger crowd may want to stay away from this company."
bad,"Terrible place to work.  Always comes up as one of the top places to work.  What a joke.  Everyone is miserable.  Company revenue flow getting squeezed by ARM designs so everyone under pressure and feeling it big time!  Just walk around the place and see the dismal faces.  The management is old school and out of touch, so beatings will continue until moral improves :-(."
bad,Micro management makes it impossible to progress in any kind of fair way. Heaven forbid a mistake is made and you are chastised and nailed to the cross. Blame and finger pointing without proper investigations as management doesn't have a clue on what their underlings job entails.You are immediately guilty and have to prove your innocence. Very toxic environment. Unless you are a favorite of the manager. All their talk of equality isn't worth a dime. There is definitely a CAST system between the Blue badges and the Contract workers. Intel blue badges are treated like Elites who by the way don't work as hard as the Green badge contract workers. There are better companies to work for with better pay and better management. Thus another reason I am leaving for out of the country for a job
bad,"I do not think, I can recommend any one to work there at Intel Corp.There is way too much work load and you work almost like a slave. Intel, BTW, has the highest burn out rate in the nation."
bad,"Intel fabs used to print money hand over fist. When the money flow slowed, the politics turned nasty. Previously, you'd find nepotism here and there, now you can find entire teams compromised of friends and wives of managers. Technical expertise has disappeared with multiple rounds of politicized layoffs, where senior technical staff was replaced by new grads and low cost geo."
bad,Intel has a very unhealthy culture. Typical day is 10-12 hours. Meetings are endless. Management only cares about their next promotion. Recommend you not consider employment there.
bad,"There is no way to move things along quickly at Intel because of the number of layers of management that prohibit nimble evolution.  To save money Intel laid off their most knowledgeable managers and then over allocated those that were left."
bad,"My manager had an outdated management style; which primarily entailed workin his underlings to death & taking all the credit for their hard work.  The group had no clear focus and/or purpose.  In fact several other groups were able to offer much better training options for the Validation community.  Tragically, my boss was really focused on keeping his job long enough to retire with rich Intel benefits & threw many, many people under the proverbial bus in order to secure his retirement."
bad,"This company promotes manager that lack people skills. This company has a high turnover rate. HR allows racial discrimination to occur, retaliation and workplace bullying. Intel says it a company of morals, but the behaviors of the individuals put in place to uphold the company standards lack character."
bad,They treat their employees like cattle and have no interest in making the employees have a life outside of work.  I found the management to be mostly focused on deadlines with little regard for the workers.
bad,"It was my dream company, but unfortunately I had a horrible experience. The management miscommunicated from the beginning. 98% were people with 20 years of experience on an average and were partial towards new people. Bringing up concerns/issues was looked down upon by the management and not taken in the right spirit. My manager started having 1:1 with me from once every 2-3 weeks to every single day, to criticise my work on a daily basis. The manager even started pressuring me in multitude of ways. I eventually had to leave."
bad,"it was a job work life balance was not "
bad,"this is an old company from the 70s that needs to get into the new world and needs new executive leadership"
bad,"Too much politics, pressure to survive. People just pretend to be someone else creating crisis one after the others. Little respects for engineers. Unstable and hostile working environment."
bad,"I would not recommend Intel to anyone. Very slow organization (takes forever to achieve anything), constant re-orgs (in other words they are clueless), poor working environment. Company is under massive pressure because they are late in wireless."
bad,"Worked for Intel longtime. Overall one can get good experience but they are not pay masters. Over time due to work culture everyone goes through Stockholm syndrome. No one wants to leave, everything looks good.... until you leave the company"
bad,Escritorio meramente figurativo. Baixa flexibilidade e não existe espaço para inovação.
bad,If there is a right way to do things and a wrong way to do things Intel now without a second though that everyone else in the world is doing things the wrong way.  A place where old approaches such as SOC take on new life only when management discovers it's effecting their stock price.  The majority of people working for Intel have never worked any place else and have no interest in ever working any place else and couldn't get a job on the outside anyways due to the lack of experiencing in doing anything any other way but the Intel way.  This is the only company I have ever worked for that discourages employees interacting with the outside world going so far as to have their own internal conferences to make sure no one ask questions.  A great place to work if you love politics and being ignored.
bad,"Intel maintains that employees are important, however their actions are to the contrary.  Certain benefits are available, but only to employees with several years at the company.  Office politics is the primary function of Intel Corp., whereas semi-conductor manufacturing is the secondary.  If you plan to excel on your own merit, this is not the company in which to do so.  If you plan on getting ahead through Deliberate Machiavellianism and yelling at others to focus attention away from your ineptitude, this is your company.  Intel is the most hostile work environment that I've ever been in, which includes fighting in the war.  They've offered me a position four times since I left their employment and I've turned it down every time."
bad,"This job is not a difficult job, but everyone there would agree they only show up to work for a pay check. There seems to be little to no appreciation for hard work or good work, and you're hardly even noticed."
bad,"People used to be happy working at Intel.  Now it seems most are unhappy. People are quitting left and right, yet they don’t open up hiring saying there’s not enough budget. Now I’m pulling the weight of 4 people with no end in sight, while making mediocre wage compared to other employers on the area.  The culture is toxic right now. I would avoid Intel for now."
bad,"I worked as a process engineer in PTD for around 4 years. "
bad,"The management is very very bad, they do not have any people skills at all. All they do is promote an Engineer to be a manager with not people skills. It is a very stressful environment with long hour days. I did have some good times there but more bad times than good. They say that we are not in competition with your peers but that is a big fat lie! I worked very hard for Intel for a long time, I put my heart and soul in that company and what do you get out of it is a BOOT out the door due to the fact I was over 50 and made to much money which took many many year of hard work to reach that salary. So if anybody wants to work there do not make any plans for retiring at this company because you will not, they will not allow this it all about age and money is the big factor, so think twice about this company."
bad,"Moved to Shift-X (Monday-Friday) Was more like Monday-Monday after last layoff. "
bad,"A typical day at work begins with stress about who will be targeted at the morning meeting for not meeting the expectations that were altered overnight.  This is followed by the meltdown of the department over what comments or foul language management used to inflame the department.  Then there is the quiet brooding as the department grinds the workload to meet expectations set in the morning that the department knows will change over night creating a phantom target that even when hit with a bulls-eye the management calls a miss the following day.  occasionally there is the epic employee melt down where anything from screaming and yelling obscenities to drawing weapons and threatening peers occurs.  All to be capped off with an end of shift meeting that establishes the department was not communicated the proper expectations by management that morning."
bad,"You'll hate every minute of work there, and feel dumb for hating it. Lots of time off, but the time you spend there is miserable. They preach safety but push work beyond safe limits. Instead of the carrot on the end of a stick model, they have switched to just bearings with the stick... while they eat the carrot."
bad,"Interesting work IF you are on the R&D side of the fence, slave labor if you are in manufacturing.  Capable of being enjoyable, if you have a good manager.  Nightmare review process.  Workplace culture is extremely Machiavellian.  Extremely stressful, high rate of engineer turnover, due to burn out.  Not worth the benefits they offer."
bad,"Management will change, your project will be canceled.  You'll be laid off, or tossed into the pool.  And GOD help you if you're not a minority, as that's all they're interested in these days."
bad,"Too much time wasted due to co-workers lack of knowledge, supervisor's lack of support, slow responsiveness from team in China, constant layoff of key team members in the middle of a project, unethical supervisors impose retribution for employees disclosing safety concern, HR team and upper level managers support dysfunctional manager and further victimizes employees, too political and some favoritism, self-preservation tactics exist ""start up"" business model does not work in a big, bureaucratic company like Intel.  Upper management and VPs are not accountable for their bad business decisions....employees are their scapegoats."
bad,"mala empresa, corren todo el tiempo, los trabajos son lo que los gringos no quieren hacer, solo ellos se promueven, no hay crecimiento"
bad,"I worked at Ronler Acres Campus as a green badge."
bad,"Don't go in as a Manufacturing Tech.  There's nowhere to go from there.  You input has no weight, you have no voice, and any ideas or suggestions you offer will disappear into the void of Intel's apathy"
bad,"I started my professional life with Intel product. It was my dream company to work for, and I eventually join them in the Bay Area. BUT it was not what I thought of Intel. I am very disappointed."
bad,"If you are thinking of joining Intel don't.  It is a mess and is not on the road to getting any better."
bad,"The working culture at Leixlip is a disgrace and truly disgusting. A non exhaustive list:"
bad,"Typical day at work: clean up after day shift. Finish their tasks while attempting to do your own shift's tasks. Wonder why day shift didn't get their assigned tasks done when they had all the engineers working on their shift and typically more technicians. Try to stay alert while the job queue rarely filled up. Repeatedly ask for more training and more detailed and clarified training - but don't receive any. Watch as the job scheduler wasn't taken full advantage of by management or engineers. The job scheduler poorly communicated to technicians when would be a good time to do scheduled maintenance, Expect that Engineers will ask you to keep up with the area maintenance schedules even when they overbooked job tasks for the area, or forgot to order the necessary supplies. Frequently expect poorly worded or confusing job run descriptions from Engineers and previous shift technicians. This will result in the frequently grumpy, woken up engineer - asked to provide clarifications. Watch while upstream items aborted in your area when they arrived - due to upstream technicians/engineers/managers failing to properly do the work/ensure that it is being done according to specifications for your area. Attempt to put out one or more fires during your shift, document them, and get your area ready for the next shift. Expect to repeatedly document the same problems from day to day, week to week, or even month to month. Always expect negative motivation from managers/engineers. Never expect constructive criticism, or positive motivation from managers/engineers. Usually expect management/engineers"
bad,"But since you asked...if you're a minority or woman or both, just know that what you'll be sold on isn't what you will experience there. D&I is not a real priority for middle management who likes things Great, just the way they've always been."
bad,Very limited career advancement opportunities. Workplace culture is not positive. I do not enjoy coming to work because I do not feel valued and adequately compensated for the work that I do.
bad,This company is determined to go overseas and shaft the American worker. The managers are out to fire anyone with high pay or long term experience.  This company does not have a future.
bad,The lack of support from mgmt for retention of employees and lack of respect for the engineers/technicians who completed the work that was necessary are severely lacking. Other Intel sites may be different but both the Occotillo site and the Hillsborough sites push people to the limits and people are leaving with management not caring.
bad,"working here will be bad for your health. The Management here have been in power for over 10 + years, despite what the company preaches they do not like change, they railroad or setup for failure anyone who seeks to change the way things are. bad communication and passing tasks on to others never wanting to do their jobs and lots of professional disrespect to go around the management is beyond bad and are nothing but drones, they cannot make a managerial decision without getting approval from above them and so forth. Many employees so severe signs of stress from weight gain, agitation, drinking booze in access after work, etc... if you need the money go for the job here but if you value yourself and family more do not work here"
bad,Its good for first job as there is a good exposure to both software and hardware oppurtunites. Not for long term as there is no good customer base.
bad,"The way I was treated reminds me of Segregation in the pre Civil Rights era.  There are all these programs and services...unless your a Green Badge.  They address others by their names...and I was ""the Green Badge"".  They have luncheons and Summer time gatherings, unless you're a Green Badge.  They have all sorts of fun things that my whole team could attend, and I was left out without even given the opportunity to pay my own way, thus further disconnecting me and making me feel left out, singled out and alone.  It's not nice nor is is conducive to a team environment and a cohesive working relationship as I was always made to feel less than the Blue Badge/Full Time employee's when my work was just as good if not better as I went the extra mile when a lot of times the FTE would just ""phone it in"" and not give it that extra effort.  "
bad,Too much pressure due to manufacturing; the money/benefits are not worth it if you end up in a team that does not act professionally towards each other.
bad,"Poor communication and hierarchy structure creates bottlenecks and micro-management environment, Decisions are fear-based and best practice is not followed. No concern for meaningful results."
bad,Intel was a great company to work for 10 years ago but in recent times the quality of the systems were significantly degraded due to poor management and prioritizing move to low paid and unskilled work force outside of USA at the high cost to USA workers forced out of our jobs after training non USA workers.
bad,"Intel has no regards for their contractors. They do things for their company but does not include the contractors.  The contractors and trades have no respect for each other.  The contractor employees are forced to work weekends without overtime to babysit the trades while they do their work. if you do not work your scheduled date, you are written up!"
bad,"The supervisors are not really involved with the team and did not do much to gather feedback about leadership. The team was treated very badly. There was a lot of yelling and name calling during meetings and when the team members raised an issue with the HR, they were just dismissed without proper investigation. Workplace bullying was not only tolerated but promoted."
bad,"The working environment is a clean room setting.  You are wearing a bunny suit, with hoses and air filters connected to your helmet.  The uniform was very restrictive in regards to your head and neck movement.  You must stand all day.  This job was hard on my body."
bad,"Being a new hire in 15 years and a huge age gap, it was difficult to fit in.  The coworkers were friendly at first but became unreasonably difficult to work with."
bad,I was forced out after 3 years with no chance to advance or transfer. Management and Human Resources are not on the employees side. Difficult to find help when faced with unfair situations.
bad,"1. I agreed to a work-through-lunch meeting with about 15 perm employees and they bought lunch for all except me, explaining that Intel new policies prohibit lunch purchases for contract employees. Advance warning here would have been helpful!"
bad,"Great place to work with incredibly intelligent, dedicated people at all levels from administrators to executives. A well run company that pays very close attention to the bottom line."
bad,Do not want to discuss in detail. I work full time and so far its been good but I like to change company. I have been involved in many different roles at Intel and enjoyed working here.
bad,"Wasn't the best job, low pay, no promotions, boss was well, won't comment. Lots of ego, threatened with firing when I refused to train co-workers even though I lost the trainer position."
bad,"Intel treats their ""employees"" extremely well.  They treat their construction contractors very poorly.  I was a contractor worker. That is just the way it is...end of story."
bad,"The place is full of young H1-B hires, I suppose fresh out of college, many of who are women, that Intel desperately needs to meet a self-imposed deadline of around 2020 to meet some kind of a 'diversity target'. OK place for tech work, but there are better ones. Not recommended for serious techies."
bad,"Intel has a weird work environment and culture.  While the engineers are all very awesome people, the people in the non-engineering departments are challenging to work with."
bad,Working environment was great. Projects were interactive and changing in a positive manner. Best tools always available to complete work taskings. Management always very supportive.
bad,"Most unprofessional environment, from the management down, I've worked in. Favoritism, absolutely no reward for going the extra mile, and no recognition."
bad,"What is really in side the real Intel world? Ask your friends or classmates who previously worked worked for intel before accepting a job offer. You will most likely get the the offer though temp agency. Big company, worse attitude. Not a good place to work for. Unless it is your best friends who is the team lead, they will treat you like dirt. They always talk down on the new hires. The worst attitude I have ever seen so far. Not only that the jobs they keep posting all year round never exist. If you pay close attention the job postings, they are the same jobs that are posted again and again."
bad,My review is simple okay through until I was actually working for brycon and I had some personal family issues that collided with the job it's through their top safety advisor I got 4 days off a PTO he signed my PTO papers allowed me to take four days off in that four days off I got terminated which is illegal in my standings and by law it is illegal to terminate someone on PTO
bad,"It's great place to work here. Good work enviorment, there is a good balance with the job work and life balance. Also the company provide free berages, fruits, coffee, teas, and other things to the employees."
bad,"Though there is flex time, it is frowned upon to use it. It is expected that you come in at 8a or thereabouts."
bad,"very good company"
bad,Very outdated managerial and leadership practices. Very unstructured and cumbersome in processes and procedures. Not a supportive work culture. Would not recommend working here.
bad,Original mission forgotten. Old boys culture. Good first job but look for better. They tend to corner you in one skillset which limits your marketability to do other things outside of Intel
bad,Competitive. It motivates you to work hard and smart. Intelligent and smart people Just need to be at right place at right time. work culture depends where you work as it may be high or low depending on the area.
bad,"extreme pressure, no work life balance, missed holidays family events, missed breaks, management went really bad, HR refused to listen,  I walked a fine line everyday, met and exceeded every expectation, and I got laid off!!!  In short they have turned into a sweat shop."
bad,completed work orders when asigned. worked among different culturs I learned to enjoy a multi diverse workplace the hardest part of the job was going home. I enjoyed working in a sterile environmet and with others
bad,"If you go to Intel, be prepared to work hard and to be a self--marketing engine."
bad,Was on a team of 2 building out some security related infrastructure. There was flexibility when it comes to how a job is to get done but there was a lack of direction that I was given at all times.
bad,"Intel is a company with all the perks you could want on paper.  Yet when it comes oppertunities to be impactful, they are very limited in what is allowed.  The narrow project focus did not allow for meaniful improvements to overall processes."
bad,My manager is uneducated in the field. Other better-qualified peers could have been named/promoted to the position. She is void of substance and ethics. She plays the political game well but not someone who anyone should trust to do the job right or on time.
bad,"They still believe in a culture that weeds out the lowest performers and that's based on peer evaluation (yes you all compete).  My first year was my last...incredibly unfair as I had just started!  After my manager found out I was going to take paternity leave, that's when she started the process to get me out."
bad,"I worked for the company as a consultant. Being a contractor in the company is eqivalent to be treated as a second citizen. You can't use gym and other employee benefits at all. Also your contract is expired without notice nor reason. Your badge stops one day and your colleagues don't even know why."
bad,too old fashioned. entire mgmt and middle mgmt needs to be changed. lot of politics and no risk taking. no encouragement for new thinking and no encouragement for bold initiative.
bad,It doesn't care employee's overall growth and capability fit.
bad,On-going budget reductions and HC reductions have made Intel IT a challenging place to work. It's hard to see friends you made over 20 yrs walk away. It has the potential to be a great place to work.
bad,"The culture is not positive. There is zero benefit if you come with a collaborative attitude. No one wants to share. Everyone protects their area of expertise to enable job security. The notion of a higher job grade is a cutting sword. If you don't work towards constant promotion you will be penalized. Sometimes, working at a top level gets you nowhere anyway. Be prepared to work in a silo."
bad,"No pagan los bonos como es debido y cambian muy seguido sus formas de trabajar, te bajan el sueldo base y te cambian de plaza cuando quieren."
bad,The company is kind of lost direction in last few years. Its latest technology products have been postponed for many times. Lack the balance between work/life.
bad,"You have to do 3 peoples jobs and the managers I had were total jerks with no real leadership skills. Terrible place. Pay raises were a joke. Run away as fast as you can. Maybe things have changed since I left. I really hope so. To be fair, over all it was a great run. My advice be careful of the internal roles you consider. It only takes one bad manager to ruin your career at Intel. I was a top performer and moved to a new role in my last year. Little did I know this so-called manager was insane. It led me to finally leave and find something better. Now I make more and I don't have to deal with a terrible manager. Sometimes the bad situations in life lead you to better situations."
bad,"A typical work week is minimally 80 hours. What I have learned that is valuable in the market place was done solely and independently by myself. The work place culture is poor, workers typically divide up by country  of origin. Workers from the same country typically help each other and support each other a lot, but when it comes to workers from another country they are reluctant to help and support, this is the hardest part of the job. Most PhDed workers and managers are not from the United States.The most enjoyable part of the job is developing new solutions yourself."
bad,"Awful place to work. Culture is absolutely awful. People take credit for others ideas an a blame culture is extremely obvious. Technicians are looked down upon by engineers and very little credit is given for their expertise. The amount of arrogant and incompetent people in this company is staggering even though I got to work in a decent group. Management is awful, no thinking goes into their decisions due to shocking arrogance. No training plan you own your own training. Career progression for a technician is non existent. You can move sideways. If you move into an engineering position which usually takes about 12 years you take a big pay cut due to loss of shift. Toxic company full of awful people. Can't leave anything on your desk as it will be stolen. To make it anywhere in this place you have to ""play the game"" which is awful."
bad,"Working for intel had its perks, but did not allow for any family life. Worked 80 hours a week. Pay was good, but no benefits were offered to anyone that hadnt been with the company for over a year. Job was only a temp."
bad,Boring and complete disconnect between management and developers. Managers relate to their employees and have little follow up on what employees working on.
bad,"A culture of paranoia and fear prevents capable people from doing their best work. No one takes responsibility or makes decisions. Everything must be decided by some ad hoc committee or follow some ""by the book"" ""plan of record"". Initiative and creativity are stifled."
bad,"long hours, little recognition, poor management"
bad,BK and his vision for Intel is poor to say the least. He and the board don't care about vision they only care about stockholders. Which makes Intel not a leader in the world... but a failure.... lead by example not let the stockholders control the research and development of what used to be the very best products in the world.
bad,"The current CEO (BK) has changed the Intel culture to a bullying culture with cheap compensation - I worked there for twenty years and he is the worst CEO ever. Very cheap,,"
bad,"I work for Intel in Hillsboro, OR and I am not in the Fab."
bad,Challenging times for Intel and they need to figure out strategy and execute as One Intel. Right now Intel doesn't walk the talk.
bad,"Reorganization is needed to enable this company to compete with an ever increasing startup culture in the world."
bad,"First job out of grad school.  High volume manufacturing site with very company specific job roles littered with political land mines.  Virtually no application of formal technical education and problem solving is subjected to anecdotal evidence.  "
bad,"Intel treated employees like an EXCEL spreadsheet file. No human side of the employee is important. Intel tried to create a value ""great place to work"" to hide the weakness of the culture in dealing with employees."
bad,"Seems to be a ""sink or swim"" type company. ""You're on your own"" attitude. Especially when the hiring manager leaves after only a few months after your start date, thus you have no champion with any investment in your success. Better just rent an apartment at first."
bad,"Consultants definitely get treated as 2nd class citizens.  Having to pay for coffee and drinks unlike full-time employee does not set the tone of inclusiveness.  Clearly telling you, that you are a 2nd class citizen, although your work sometimes are pushed to meet deadlines, especially when your contract is short.  No mercy from management."
bad,"Be aware of the time when you hit the 20 year mark and your approaching retirement, this will be the time you'll get let go. Im the example and many of my colleagues are also."
bad,"Management making wrong decisions all the time and making its employees suffer. "
bad,There are a lot of meetings during the day and a lot of pressure to get work done. Most Engineers are there past 6 pm everyday and the average life of an engineer is pretty short.
bad,Awesome workplace and has great potential to succeed if mgmt can really recognize and reward talent. Performance management is not fair and old ways of doing reviews still exist.
bad,"I did not like Intel. "
bad,"While I am a loyal Intel customer, their internal workings are so bloated and congested that decisions end up being made by people who have no authority to make them. This led to constant work problems and management was incredibly petty and poor."
bad,Intel has changed in the last few years from a company that cares about products and production to one which is more concerned about quarterly reports and short term savings.
bad,"Used to be a company that encouraged new and innovative thinking.  Now it's a place to become a VP and have many employees only follow you down a path.  Free thinking is not encouraged.  Reviews are set up to targets for the next layoff.  People are very territorial, as if someone else can do their job, they are at risk in losing it.   Soon Corporate Affairs and Foundation work will be eliminated.  Engineers can thrive here, others should move to another company.  Sad times for this former leader."
bad,Good benefits but now career advancements. Ready to put at least 12 hours a day without any work-life balance. Management does not care about employees at all. Employees are treated as a machine.
bad,"Excel sheet driven management decisions. Numbers are predetermined and whichever criteria allows them to get to the number, they use it. Lack of transparency between all levels of organization."
bad,they promote segregation and an atmosphere of disdain between their blue badge workers and their green badge workers almost like the old jim crow era but for badge color
bad,"Intel prefers the use of contingent workers to fill full time positions instead of hiring people.  This is to keep ""head counts"" down and satisfy shareholders at the expense of people who want jobs."
bad,"The culture at Intel is deteriorating, and the pay is slower than market.  Unfortunately it's the symptom of a company that is slowing in its growth.  I used to enjoy working here, but nowadays, it's very stressful and the hours are excruciatingly long.  Pay raises cannot even keep up with inflation in the Bay Area."
bad,"That's all I like about this place and that's pretty sad."
bad,"- Typical day at work - busy"
bad,"Managers never seen my work and only heard what el promoting leads would tell them. Leads would hide or play during the day while lowers would do all the work. If a lead broke a tool set the lower would get blamed and fired. Very disfunction at that time maybe it was changed. I personal loved working there, but I guess I worked to much and did not fit in the culture of relax. A-MAT not intel"
bad,"work life balance is very poor. money is good, but culture is bad. would not recommend my friends and family members to work here."
bad,I found this place to be highly discriminatory. Unfairness seen all over. I do not recommend this place to anyone.
bad,Intel has become a very robot oriented company. The supervisor (GL = Group Leaders) are in need of management training badly. I don't say nothing here because Intel employees can't handle the truth. I am looking to get out of here and advise anyone who is thinking about applying or wanting to work here to reconsider. The Engineering staff will treat you badly as The new Intel promotes this sort of behavior. This is not a Great Place to work.
bad,"They have been very successful in microprocessors and have a monopoly on them, but other areas are suspect. They tried to get into more areas by acquiring companies. This did not work. Most of these ventures have failed. Their main product is Powerpoint presentations rather than chips. I have never worked anywhere that was as bureaucratic as Intel. Most of the employees are conceited and buy into the whole ""Intel culture"" but they are fooling themselves. They support a program of internal transfers, but I found that there are a lot of people there that use this to be moving targets so they do not have to actually produce anything. I was there 3 years and was effected by 4 reorganizations."
bad,Rio Rancho factory made 1/2 of intel profits so it was a high pressure work place.
bad,"Intel pays very low compared to industry standards. Only for VLSI and Embedded systems related fields Intel pays reasonably , But if you are working as web development engineer you cannot survive with the salary they pay in Bangalore."
bad,Intel is a dinosaur in Silicon Valley. The inability to meet customer demand in its core business and lack of leadership in its new business have resulted in a stagnant company and work environment.
bad,"Intel could be great or horrible depending on your manager and group. My experience was more on the horrible side, but YMMV. Worked for 7 managers in less than 4 years and none of them had any experience or clue on what I did.  That's not a bad thing when you've been there a while or have a lot of experience and know what your doing. However, I was a brand new employee straight out of college so it was definitely sink or swim with no help or guidance. So yeah that kind of sucked. :(.  Some people stick it out for long careers while others have fled the first chance they get.  Focals suck, as I said before none of my managers had a clue about my work, so I felt like I always got the short end of the stick while they heaped praise and raises on the guys who worked in fields the managers understood.  Open floor plan sucked big time, we didn't have cubes just workbenches. It was very loud and very hard to get anything done when you have people constantly walking behind you all day long. The manager in charge of seating assignments was one of the most pettiest persons I have met, so he put the people he didn't like in the worst spots even though they came in every day, and gave some of the best spots to his friends who hardly ever came in. "
bad,The team picked who they wanted to support and not the whole team. Although we got the work done individually we could have been more productive as a real team.
bad,"The job paid well, which is really all that can be positively stated about Intel, specifically the Portland Technology Development group.  Within that group, engineers have to back stab each other, undermine each other's work, and fight for any bit of recognition possible lest they be ranked poorly and then terminated.  Not a good environment in the least."
bad,My job was to drive a forklift to clean up the area .that was assinment to each employment.Ity was 10hr long each and every day .you would a check on your forklift each and every day.
bad,"Intel is a successful company with a lot to offer in terms of benefits and perks, but the work-life balance is poor. Meetings take up most of the day and I often had to stay late in order to get tasks completed."
bad,"fast environment with a blame culture."
bad,"Intel should hire local resources rather than hiring cheap labor from global markets, who are not very qualified to perform many of the functions, which impacts the quality of the products."
bad,The day started with meetings and continue with meetings throughout the day in different topics that were expected to be the expert. The job still needed to get done at the end of the day somehow.
bad,"A place that does not see the employees at all but as unskilled worker only. The managers are not empowering, they are always hurting and pressing. There is no personnel HR management at all. Everything should be done by the computer directly to Poland, no one looks at you and the managers do what they want"
bad,"I was hired to be a Wafer Tool Technician, however upon relocating and starting the job I was reassigned to Quality Assurance Install.  There was little to no training on this new position and there was no option to turn it down."
bad,A pendulum is the best way to describe management. About the time you implement what they wanted last week it changes. Projects became a popularity contest where employees would run towards projects that might gain the most visibility whether they added value or not.
bad,I do not have access to any of this information as I am a contractor.  Working as a contractor is tough as I do not have access to things I really could do for the company.  I get it .
bad,A typical day was reviewing data from video driver tests from spreadsheets and seeing what the issues were and how to fix them. I learned quite a bit about video drivers and how Microsoft certifies them. Also the different ways that videos are composed such as how the interlacing is and is it top to bottom or bottom to top. All these things can affect how changes to the video are rendered on the system. The management was ok explaining what the goal was and how to get that done. But when I was there the company was going through many transitions and laying off many people and closing some of the buildings. The team we were on was not a money maker for the company so we were always in flux about how much the team is needed. The most enjoyable part was the people and working on new interesting things. The hardest part of working there was just the way everything was in flux for the employment. The position was not that difficult of analyzing the data but the stress of actually staying late and not being paid many times was not good.
bad,"Although I worked for a terrific manager and worked on a very innovative product launch, the overall corporate management was too unfocused.  Has amazing resources and technical expertise but poorly managed from a strategic standpoint.  Company is still fundamentally a ""chip"" house but wants to be all things to all customers."
bad,"Lots of opportunity for advancement, until you hit your 50's and you've topped out in many of the jobs.  I would recommend looking outside of Intel to advance your career, once you are approaching 45 - 50, otherwise a great company to get your career and earnings jump started."
bad,"If you have a good manager--a 50/50 proposition for a decent work-life.  However, the culture at Intel and the annual review process can be pretty harrowing (read:  not fair).  You can actually do your very best work and your review will sometimes be a roll of the dice--again, depending on the all-powerful manager.  Having been a manager there, I know what I'm talking about with crystal clarity."
bad,"The few interesting projects and intelligent co-workers are the best parts. Average compensation. Stress level depends on which group you are in. Due to the PC market slowdown, the company has been going through annual staff reductions in the last two years that focus more on people who spent a decade or more with the company. After 20 years with the company, you can be walked out of the door immediately after being notified. As a result, the morale is low among long term employees. The other effect of rolling layoffs is that the corporate environment becomes even more political. Not much job security if you are not in your manager's close circle. On the up side, managers' bonus is tied to how well they meet the under-represented minority hiring quota. So it's a good time for an URM to join."
bad,Project groups can be very large and you feel like just another cog on the gear.  The work can be very process driven and monotonous.  Constant deadlines and expectations to work extra hours.
bad,50% of the job is tedious tasks. 30% is pulling and summarizing data. 20% is troubleshooting a tool that wasn't designed for the purpose we are using it and it is near impossible to make a good judgement about how to fix it other than guessing. Management is not concerned with your work life balance. It can be very stressful.
bad,"- A standard work place. "
bad,"good work life balance at intel with decent amount of work and no pressure environment, also good work location which are not very crowded"
bad,"In order to excel in intel, network is more important than the engineering  skill set.  Intel values know-who more than know-how. For recent graduate, intel is good place to become a mass production worker."
bad,"Started in 1995, left just a little while back.  Used to fun, interesting, now is boring, corporate, bureaucratic, doesn't support innovation.  The 'Ranking & Rating' system is laughable, requires somebody to be put in the 'lower third' and not be eligible for bonuses.  You end up competing against your peers, who are also supposed to be your teammates.  The most insane (80 hour weeks/no family) usually wins.  Good luck succeeding in that environment.  There is no real teamwork here."
bad,Intel is a good company and I really enjoyed working on the IT side of the business rather than the EC side.  They really work you here but you will mass a lot of knowledge in a short time.
bad,"I was advised before I joined Intel that it was a big ship that takes a long time to change course.  It is certainly a large company that seems to focus more on keeping their people placated with fun things while wondering why their quality is so poor.  Their almost fanatical embrace of globalization causes a lot of problems for teams that have to coordinate through several different time zones."
bad,"have some fun, the problem is there is no fix salary that make us so worry in everyday that we came to our office."
bad,Built the QA team to 17 people to test and validate AT&T's review and merit process. All Unix application.
bad,"They soak everything they can get out of you and then let you go with younger lower paid employees!  Intel is not like it used to be.  They use to care about your family life then layoffs came.  Go to night shift or no job.   Just wasn't any fun to work for anymore.  Fun was not allowed,  1 employee was suppose to do 3 employees job and they didn't care for a life out of Intel anymore."
bad,"Sometimes, there's no better conversation starter than a totally out-of-left-field bit of information. Maybe it's a tiny factoid about a popular brand. Or a little-known piece of history that flips your perspective upside-down. Perhaps it's a mesmerizing bit of trivia about nature or the world at large. No matter what types of facts typically strike your fancy, make sure to read these 50 totally random and 100 percent wildly interesting facts that are guaranteed to earn you some new friends.

bad,"Site requires further examination for a broader range of vocations and positional roles , search engine is impressive, but the site requires more enrollment from a greater number of companies"
bad,"I would never work there again. There is a pecking order there and a concern for the bottom line which takes precedence over everything and causes everyone down the chain of command to treat everyone below them like cattle. I have kept contact with people since I left and have heard of one example after another of their penny-pinching ways at the expense of the careers of loyal employees. They are a company with no heart and soul, and I have watched their missteps for years in the marketplace, with one failed product after another, while upper management skates through and makes lower level employees pay the price. One of their missteps was the reason behind my being laid off. If I had stayed in the processor division I would have worked there longer but I tried to move into a new product division (which failed months into it). They bragged about their work culture when I was there but it was all smoke and mirrors."
bad,"Lots of glamor from outside,  but inside is another story."
bad,"Typical day involves coding, validation, working with different teams to produce a test tape for HVM."
bad,I start working at 9 am till 5 pm. THe work culture is not that great but it depends a lot on the team in which you are in. Bonus and salary are very competitive.
bad,"The company enjoyed as a De-facto monopoly for more than a decade in the past and the culture atrophied. Bloated executive management suite with a palace intrigue like culture. Over staffed across the board with in fighting at all levels. At the fourth stage of Jim-Collins' book, ""How the Mighty Fall"". Recently got broad sided by AMD and NVIDIA as starters. 2018 is likely going to be a bloodbath as the company faces more headwinds."
bad,It is a good place for hardware development or mid-managment level. more challenging for software development because the culture is so different and behind.
bad,"In the 90's Intel's culture revolved around the employee and output."
bad,"Brutal restructuring in progress."
bad,"If you work in the fab, you are a slave...at least in IMO. Many a good people have voluntarily left the IMO Ronler Acres site due to the work environment."
bad,"I spent nine years in Intel's IT Communications department, received all-positive reviews, and lost my job for being an underperforming employee. Why? The official word is that I didn't do enough my last couple of years to show personal growth in my job; not demonstrate enough of an interest to learn other things. The reality is that there simply wasn't anywhere else for me to go in my job, short of becoming a manager or leaving for another department. I'm in communications. What do I do next -- become an engineer?"
bad,"Expect long hours, multi-tasking, continuous meetings and ambiguous management direction. Management rates employees based on gossip and innuendo and not on actual accomplishments.  If you have great ideas, be careful about who tell or some people will quickly steal your ideas as their own. As a process and R&D engineer it is disheartening to work 12 to 20 hours a day while others can be seen in fab playing games on the computer or sitting around gossiping."
bad,The workplace was O.K. and the co-workers were easy to get along with. The management had issues with department organization and training for workers. Too few people fully trained to train new workers to work on product and excessive down time. Communication can sometimes be unclear. Best part was when there was work you were allowed to do. The most important thing I learned was to to go with the flow at all costs.
bad,"Night shift with overtime"
bad,going into best buy approaching customers and convincing them to swith over to directv if they didnt have it already.
bad,Intel is no longer the company it was 20 years ago.  Grew too big and lost the culture that made it a great place to work at.  They do pay well however they will over work you and all hours.
bad,"The discriminate according to education, age and race.  When we got laid off or was all the 40-60 crowd.  But you sign a disclosure package to not speak of it."
bad,"Working in this company give me a strong feeling that Team work lead to a best working skill... In future I have a good interpersonal skills, lots of encouragement thru this journey with my colleagues."
bad,"Intel was stable for a while, but eventually the company went through massive layoffs when it was clear they were not making progress in mobile computing."
bad,"My role - to begin with - was uncertain, as I was unable to easily navigate through extremely elaborate security and restrictions concerning vital project information. Time was lost with indeterminate goals, badly documented existing procedures, and unreliable hardware. I did come supplied with textbooks for the design and mathematical foundations of what was to be done (statistical measurements of jitter), but there were few opportunities to work with the existing team members, many of which seemed to be almost permanently unavailable. Work was almost entirely alone; most working days were just that. Feedback was sporadic and delayed."
bad,"Visibility counts more than merit."
bad,"Employees at Intel- Make Intel a Great Place to Work, that is why we stay and the Intel provides great health benefits. The job, in manufacturing, is stressful. You are on call at night and the weekend, you are filling out forms, in addition to trouble-shooting and it is always needed now. Intel is always changing and if you do not change quickly enough, you become a liability and you become tired. The question from managers is never how can we help you succeed- it is more like Why can't you succeed. The culture, if you are lucky is great but if you do not mind the hours, losing time with your family and always under the microscope then this job is for you."
bad,"Really slow, inefficient work culture. People use nothing but PowerPoint and meetings are generally fruitless and no action taken, no decisions made afterward. Most of time people are just spinning their wheels, not going anywhere."
bad,"Very high tech equipment, which is a good challenge, But always have to watch your back, with the cut throat work culture."
bad,Intel probably has the biggest challenge now to find it's purpose in a a world where the PC is become less relevant.  I wish them the best of luck.
bad,"Both awful, and some ok too.mentoring not so good. good opportunities to self learn and grow. good compensation & benefits."
bad,"You get on the ground floor of some cutting edge technology. "
bad,"Working in PTD involves development of cutting edge CMOS process technology. However, the work culture within PTD is not very collaborative and often combative. Work-life balance is poor."
bad,"Techs are treated great, high pay and work 3&4 day weeks. Job is a little boring, but they are well compensated financially and with time off."
bad,"1. Career advancements - not so great"
bad,Work life balance is tough. There is always too much work than one can handle. Higher management fails to employ more people when they can afford to.
bad,Great pay and benefits with incredibly talented people. A very competitive environment with opportunities to learn new skills.
bad,"Intel used to be a great company to work for -- they were at the top of the processor game without challengers. They truly valued employees, and employees were loyal in return. During the last decade, Intel has slipped badly -- missing opportunities and being forces to play catch up. This in turn, has changed the way Intel is. Employees are well paid, overworked, wondering in their position will be transferred to a low cost Geo or outsourced. Most Intel IT people would not recommend Intel IT to family or friends as a place to work for at this time."
bad,"There are many good things about Intel. Work life balance, stress and culture are not among them. There is also a potential health hazard. Cubes are stacked tightly and closely. With a global community, there are various approaches to basic hygiene. Touching surfaces can become problematic as proper hand washing is not always observed. Germs abound. Think twice before touching communal plastic ware, serving utensils or pot luck items."
bad,I spent over 16 years at Intel and was laid off 3 times only to be replaced by contracted work  a month or two later.  They seem to have a major layoff every 3 or 4 years and immediately backfill the positions with either contractors or new college graduates.  I swore I would never go back after leaving in 2014 but decided to give them another try.  I was hired as a long term contractor and the job was supposed to be indefinite but was laid off after 3 months due to another reorg.
bad,"Workplace culture was very political, male dominated and if not an engineer, contributions not valued or were dismissed. Company offers great training and opportunity for getting additional education outside of Intel if your level is high enough, also bonus and benefits were very generous. Politics and boys club atmosphere of Intel ""lifers"" made outsiders of anyone new to management, esp. females. If your male and love to play office politics games you'll succeed here."
bad,"The company does not provide good compensation; and lots of hierarchy and red tapism in most of the groups. "
bad,"This used to be a very good company to work for."
bad,"The pay in San Diego is great, but the culture is tedious.Too many cooks in the kitchen when decisions are made. Lots of fits & starts on product features. Internal turf wars among executive leadership. Product & sales teams are not very in tune with customer demands or evolving market trends. They only listen to each other."
bad,"The workplace culture is of high stress related to more failures than successes of the company. Management does not look to improve the organizations in their abilities, but to maximize the reduction and push employees to points that health is often questioned as top performers are isolated and limited in advancement to cover the lack of skill of the other workforce. Workplace dynamics of acceptability has replaced skill level dynamics leaving many gaps in technical skill and ability. ""Intel will still be here tomorrow"" and ""Everyone has different Skill levels"" were daily mantras to excuse failure to perform issues of teams and individuals to ensure the appearance of a diverse workforce are maintained."
bad,"Since BK took over, culture changed.  Intel as a whole turned their back on the senior talent in lieu of Indian and Chinese PhD on a discount (VISA).  Those 35 years and older have no chance at the company any longer due to age discrimination.  Those who had loyalty is now lost it due to the disrespect from upper management.  Middle management doing their best to keep you excited about the effort or sacrifice you give to the job."
bad,"Intel is a good company but it is too big and has too much overhead. However, it has the state of the art technology. I started as a manager and  I needed to hire five people. I spent most of my time reviewing the resumes, interviews, and in meetings. Did not get any technical work done. That was not quite satisfactory for me."
bad,"I was working hard in Intel for reporting issues timely, Working on weekends and even holidays."
bad,"Management will by pass you if you are not ""a good old boy"" lots of favoritism in my department the current manager controls everyone including upper management as if he was holding something on them. I have friends in other areas and it totally different, over all good company but the department I was in was not a good experiment"
bad,"My ratings differ between the two jobs I had at Intel:"
bad,"Intel on paper was the ideal position. However, in practice you are pushed to meet commitments but everyone is very quick to push you under a bus to make themselves look good... Especially management"
bad,"Despite 10+ years of successful reviews, I was blind sided and fired and told I could never work at Intel again. I had spent my entire technical career there and was extremely qualified for other jobs at Intel but not allowed to seek out any of them. About 70% of the employees feared losing their jobs every focal process. We knew that 5 - 10 percent of the people we worked with would get demoted or fired every year regardless of performance. Somebody had to get nailed leaving managers forced to pick employees that did a great job and in no way deserved it. This forced the culture to be cut throat and caused peers to rat out each others to increase the odds that they would not get fired or demoted the next focal cycle."
bad,"Most software I've worked with at Intel is 'home grown, patched together' software that hasn't evolved with the company. IT folks spend the bulk of time fixing programs that should be outsourced to a company that specializes in it. I'm personally looking to find a company that uses relevant tools and focuses on employee growth."
bad,"Intel used to be a highly desired company to work for. The culture has now become fairly toxic. Hard to recommend as a great place to work. Advancement is hard to come by, even with management support."
bad,The projects keep getting cancelled and overall morale is low. There is no scope for growth for the first 3 years. Hardest part is working on scripting which doesn't challenge you or make use of your skills acquired in academia.
bad,"Stressful, cut-throat, and desperate.  It's a company where your friends stab you in the front.  Great financial compensation but at the expense of losing your soul."
bad,The pay was excellent but the overall experience did not reward other than economically. The CEO had no vision and the company culture was non-existent or toxic.
bad,"Its very good and strategically well being..."
bad,"incredible people to work with and some of the most amazing products to work on.  "
bad,"Intel as a company appears to be okay to work for."
bad,"The people were great but the engineering infrastructure was a disaster which results in micromanagement and absurd numbers of meetings. They really need to fix the engineering infrastructure, then it would be a good place to work."
bad,"Slow to adapt to change and bogged down with Corporate bureaucracy. Managers have created an environment where employees are not rewarded for their work, but rather pointing fingers at their peers and sabotaging others' work. Blue badge employees are mainly spending their time watching the clock instead of working. If you just want to earn a paycheck, it's a great place to work. If you plan on staying, I'd advise you rethink that strategy. I was working there during the 2016 layoffs and it was my second time working at Intel. 12,000 employees were let go for ""making too much money."" Anyone who had been there longer than 5 years was constantly worried about losing their job. People are no longer assets but cogs in the machine there."
bad,"It is a nice Monday through Friday schedule with limited nights and weekends.  I liked most of my co-workers / employees, but senior management needs an overhaul."
bad,Intel modems are not good enough for automation. Hard to pass TCs in automation. Testers are not doing quality work. Managers are not bother about the products quality.
bad,"Good communication among all staff."
bad,"Intel provides opportunities to learn and develop. no constraints from manager or people above , so spending my time on improving my weak areas. and gaining experiences."
bad,"I came to work... so I did. After working, I went home to come back and do it over again. I did my work over and above what was called for but was never recognized for my efforts. We always had the fear of lay offs hanging over our heads."
bad,"I have learned a lot from about computer and the chip-sets while I've worked at Intel, Co. It also helped me more hands-on in the real world"
bad,typical day at work was satisfying.  Unfortunately they laid off permanent employees and replaced them with contractors to save money.  They also shipped jobs overseas to China
bad,"It's a good place to be if you are an employee. If you are a contractor, you're work environment won't be as pleasant as you'd hope for."
bad,Intel has gone through many layoffs since 2016. The pattern was obvious. Employees who were older with high salaries have been the majority of the people who were laid off.
bad,I have many Intel’s platform and SoC with extensive industry HW and SW experiences. I have worked few companies as wireless communication architecture and HW designer.
bad,"A typical day at work, very stressful. I learned somewhat the 10nm finfet Intel process. Management was good and the workplace culture was great. The hardest part of the job was learning, understanding and applying the Intel 10nm finfet process. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers."
bad,"The H.R. function was going away due to a no external hiring policy. All H.R. folks had to lay off groups and organizations due to building closing."
good,"A day a work, started with data entry of all student test and reporting back to the teacher. Documentation, scanning, logging, tracking,research and filing. The hardest part of the job was meeting deadlines on or around holidays. I wouldn't say this job was enjoyable at all it was all nose to the grinding stone."
good,"They got sued, and lost, a few years ago for hiring H1B visa candidates in order to suppress wages. This is a prime example of the anti-worker culture at the company. Good luck getting support."
good,"While working at Intel many people were ready to throw me under the bus to keep their jobs, I had to train myself on many of the actions and job roles I had there. The ONLY redeeming quality was working the 3 days on, 4 days off, 4 days on 3 days off (12 hour shifts) allowed me to have twice a month a 4 day weekend."
good,"Contractor - assisted with IT Service Center"
good,"Empresa em amadurecimento no ramo , mas que possui bons profissionais"
good,"work, work and work, very challenging at the beginning but sometimes can be hard to transfer between groups/department sometimes."
good,"Not a good place to grow career (specially for an analog engineer)."
good,This is a large corporation and you are just a number here. No room for growth unless you know people. I saw first hand people who were promoted to only because they knew certain people.
good,"If you are coming for an internship, don't have high hopes for full-time conversion.otherwise the work culture is good and you will get to learn a lot."
good,"The focus on performance reviews has devolved the culture at Intel to encourage a ""teach the test"" like mentality. The great work creating wizbang quality products designed by industry innovators has slowly died to one where scared children following recipes make commodity ho-hum products."
good,"Intel solid company. Management not very good.  They don't listen to employee concerns.  When issues are escalated they tend to sweep things under vs dealing.  Team members are stifled from making significant advances.  You have to hire in to get paid more, the employees that have been there are not paid the best.  Frequently they can be overlooked for the new hires being brought in."
good,good opportunity for RCG but stressful with less importance to work life balance and career growth for process engineers is hard. management requires the engineer to work on weekends as well. on call system is drains the energy out of the engineers. on the other hand companys benefits are good.
good,"Intel provides its employees opportunities to learn and grow, makes it easy for the employees to move around to help with their careers. However, work life balance is not always there."
good,"A company without a proper view of the future needs. In a time when mobility and mobile devices are a must,  the emphasis and the efforts were directed towards old desktop and server business."
good,"Intel has high stress, expects employees to operate at above levels for extended periods of time.      Long time employees have no expectation of commitment from Intel."
good,Good place for freshers as they get opportunity to learn and appreciate things. But compensation could hit you hard as experience grows.
good,Empresa dinâmica com pouca estabilidade devido a crise gerencia determinada com dificuldade de crescimento  e com o salario decaindo cada dia mais
good,"Work came when product showed up. Most people were scared of their managers even though they had no idea what our jobs consisted of. They go completely against their core values and leave you feeling exhausted every day. Some great people work there, and even manage. Most enjoyable part of the job was the pay."
good,Actively pursing minorities and women.  40+ and a white male is a ticket to unemployment.  Work people like dogs with no respect and are proud of their track record.  Manufacturing work isn't particularly difficult but it is done with your hands tied and for imbecilic management.  If you're actually a good engineer this job will bore you to tears.
good,"multi-tasking skill is a must. however, there are times where there is nothing to do. which during those time is used to train. overall, it's dynamic and fun to be at."
good,OK place to work. Somewhere between the mind numbing Boeing and the PITA Microsoft companies.
good,"I was hoping for more growth opportunities. Due to the number of changes going on, there has been a hiring freeze that does not work for my long term personal career goals."
good,"In my 20 year career I got to experience many facets of the company. I was a low level programmer, SW and test architect, test infrastructure, Lab management, CPU validation enabling, and Server Chipset/CPU enabling. "
good,Management leans towards people who are more expressive or talkative even though the person is not delivering much. Being social would be a good score.
good,My time at Intel was pretty uneventful. Nothing great as there was lots of day to day pressure as a 1st line manager in a high volume manufacturing environment. Many accomplishments went un-appreciated as it is a huge company and most people are looking out for themselves vs. creating a real team 1st culture.
good,"Work was fast paced, many employees do as little work as possible and expect a lot in return. My last year I cycled through 5 managers (I was working the same position the entire time). Hard workers go unrecognized."
good,"I worked for Intel a little over two years.  My first experience was in corporate legal and it was absolutely wonderful, I liked it so much I ran to work everyday, I am also a little bias because I enjoy opportunities where I can learn and in legal because the atmosphere changes so often I learned something knew every day.  I also worked in Global Tax, the VP's of Global Tax and Trade were phenomenal, but my direct manager in finance was not.  I have never met someone like him and he broke me down a little every day."
good,"Intel is a very large organization with facilities and offices all over the world.  While I enjoyed the people I worked with immensely, the management at Intel was and is some of the most out-of-touch, overly intrusive, dismissive and critical in the tech industry.  Forcibly, employees, especially contractors are regarded with less respect and advocacy than some of the equipment in the hallways.  While hard work is appreciated, mistakes, even small ones, are not tolerated.  Quality expectations do not align with reality of error rates in such environments, and my group did not make many.  But, on the rare occasion when one did, it was treated as an extinction event.  In the little more than a decade at my job I learned not to invest time getting to know co-workers, not knowing if they would remain employed there for more than a week.  And those were the good ones."
good,"Good structure"
good,"Intel as a giant technology company, work environment is a very nice and demanding for individual development and success. This motivates people and the teams to do better and develop themselves. It is like a old school for IT workers. Team spirit, cooperation, cross functional working environment, global scale and sharing, multicultural teammates and environment feeds you a lot and develops you a lot."
good,por etica no me es posible escribir acerca de la empresa
good,"Intel is a good company to work for.  However, job stability is also doubtful as they continue to purchase other company and grow their employee base which always led to downsizing down the road.  The corporate culture was fast-paced and stressful at times.  Because Intel is a worldwide company, it always meant that many employees found themselves working at all hours of the day/evening to accommodate every geography."
good,"Intel has always had very intelligent employees, as a result everybody knows everything ;)"
good,Challenging work environment.   You are only told what you need to know and sometimes less than that.  Job growth is exponentially difficult after first 4 years.
good,Upper management thinks of the employees as a number. Output is the only concern for this company. I would not work for this company again.
good,Company benefits i.e health insurance and bonus are good.  Co-worker are good people however work life balance is not healthy.
good,Good place to work. Your growth depends on your manager.  The yearly progress review for  promotions is not transparent.  Project and resource management is also not transparent.
good,"As a Green Badge worker. I would my job at CPTD is enjoyable. management that work with very good. The pay is good also. But, being a green Badge worker. I limited in job advancement and I could be let go at anytime."
good,"I was allowed to skew my hours to take my daughter to school but in the end I was told that it hindered my growth. "
good,"as a lab technician, you'll have a chance to use some state of art instrument from soldering machine to o-scopes. Expect long work hours, especially during power on, 80hrs/week is normal. You get to meet a lot of people with many different backgrounds, also be expected to be told what to do because they have a degree and you don't. "
good,"Decent place to work. Nature of work is repetitive and can become boring fast. Raises are below rate of inflation. Work environment is extremely competitive due to exploitative focal process. Career advancement not based on skill, ability or accomplishments, but perception and likability from management. Glass ceiling exists for minorities."
good,The company overall is a good company to be a part of.  Upper-level managers in corporate services lack strong management ability. Good benefits. The sabbatical is a plus and a wonderful perk.
good,"Because they invented the x86, they think that the x86 is the best microprocessor int he world."
good,"Unless you are apart of the ""good ole boys"" club, don't think of getting any help with your career development.  They promoted their friends and canned anyone they didn't like and couldn't control.  This happened everywhere inside the company."
good,"Culture terrible in the factories, too much put on those that do the work, but compensation is only based on being mistake free which engenders a feeling that the less I do the more successful I'll be."
good,"Good luck... The new mantra is ""No re-employment"". They don't seem to be willing to hire anyone who worked there in the past.. "
good,"The particular department I was a part of, was very cut throat and not into helping employees excel.  We were expected to know answers and not make mistakes.  It was never a fun place to be.  I was always stressed out and didn't have many people to reach out to for guidance.  The department I worked in was big on reading between the lines.  It took me the first two years to figure that out the hard way, once I did, I was laid off with about 1000 other employees."
good,"Intel is a huge company, so it varies wildly from group to group.  For my first few years of working here, I enjoyed it a lot.  However, when the going got tough and we had a project that our management over-promised on, the true colors have come through.  Pushing employees to make up for managerial schedule mistakes eventually takes its toll."
good,"Operated, maintained and repaired Ion Implant machines by two different manufacturers. Trained new hires in operations and process of semiconductor products. "
good,Reviews at the end of the year or beginning of the year are have no transparency and meritocracy does not exist here.  You get promoted if you have been there for years and if you haven't angered management in some form or another.
good,Working there for so long was a fantastic run.  Under BK they chose to burn the place down and that's unfortunate in many ways.  Can it be recovered ?
good,Good place to work if they could make you feel secure. Layoffs are the norm and the culture has suffered due to the instability. Company culture is all about the bottom line and employees don't matter as much as they once did to them. It is common place to lay off long time employees and then hire them back shortly thereafter as contract employees to make their headcount numbers look better to appease shareholders.
good,"Hi tech work environment."
good,very busy and less work life balance. Some of the managers are good and some are not. very fast pace. the few years there were knowledgeable and leaned many skills.
good,"Benefits were definitely good, better than most but the overall culture at Intel was not appealing to me. Poor leadership and management at the higher levels for sure."
good,"Intel base pay is low, but makes up for it in 4 quarterly bonuses and 1 annual bonus. The also provide you with some golden handcuffs. Each year, you are given x shares but vests over 4 years. There is no 401K matching, but Intel will contribute x% yearly of your total compensation. This will vest over 5 years. Benefits are great, compensation is also great...if you're looking to coast. Not a great place to work if you're a millennial looking to hustle and move up or quickly. Career advancement is slow and very political."
good,"At Intel, results are the only means of measurement that matters. Expect to provide operational results or be cut from the production line as soon as they can find someone else to fill your position. There is no excuse in their book as to why a goal cannot be met, regardles of outside influnces."
good,Very much the title summarizes it. Company lack the direction and vision. Management lack empathy. Diversity program was a marketing stunt.. there was really no intention of becoming a fair employer.
good,"Good worklife balance but little growth opportunities. No Job Security, outdated in terms of technology. Poor administration and management. Lot of Re-orgs."
good,"Poor treatment of military veterans"
good,"The Intel culture is now defined by the pressures of external politics, popular social ideologies, and legal scrutiny from the FTC and SEC.  The machine is driven very much tops-down leaving little room for dissent, creativity, and empowerment.  Intel is a national treasure and truly is a unique force that can compete internationally with China unlike any other US semiconductor company, but be aware of the challenges this company presents culturally."
good,"challenging environment, from the CEO down, not a company that values employees all that much.  "
good,Good Company but very competitive. Good pay but too much politics and backstabbing and bigotry. The company pride itself in being a meritocracy. No job security at all.
good,"Bad work to life balance, bad job culture, bad progression through the company minimal training. Job culture is the main downfall other than that a good company to work for."
good,"A typical day would involve running through emails, putting out immediate fires and processing the work needed for that day.  There is daily interaction with many different levels of employees and departments.  "
good,Unappreciated and no job security. Inconsistent expectations and goals took too long to accomplish due to red tape. Too many useless meetings made it hard to get any real work done. Little face to face communication. Mostly all email.
good,Job scope is good and could be a nice learning place however I learned this is not at all good- you can choose to learn and growth somewhere else. Here it has a lot finger pointing and no such engineering happening. All is done at the suppliers and little to none is done at Intel. PhD people please go look somewhere else.
good,"Use to truly live up to its motto ""Great Place To Work"", but has fallen sharply in recent years and in particular recent months with the new Leadership. The 12k layoffs have caused untold grief, hardship and shock across Intel culture and handled horribly. Have lost all respect for company and no trust or dedication is left. Sad to see this for a once great giant. It is truly the Titanic of 2016 slowly going under. Rest in Peace."
good,"It was ok for 15 years. There are issues of ""elder abuse"" within the ranks though, several of which have resulted in wrongful term suits."
good,"Intel is an awesome company but they want your life.  You will work like a dog and be paid well.  But, if you have a family or loved ones they may have problems with the time spent at work, or when your home - time on your laptop.  When you do have free time, you are required to volunteer for Intel.  Most people leave after their sabbatical - seven years."
good,A very fast paced environment with exceptional technology.  Always a challenge everyday to meet milestones.  Team efforts are always welcome.
good,"It is ok to work for well known company but too much stress and politics. If you become regulator employee then benefits. work as a "
good,"Managed hardware for over 100 MoBo's daily to configure HDD's attached for specific RAID testing."
good,The job environment was very supportive and engaging to my skills
good,a lot of teams working towards the same goal is what I experienced during my time at Intel.
good,Some managers would not help you where others would.
good,The whole site I worked at was constantly at risk for a shutdown and the lack of consistent projects for the team to work on as a whole gave a lack of confidence in the company
good,"I am not doing this part. I was there for a long time and that is all I have to say. "
good,"Work at Intel for over 10 years was fruitful financially, but extremely stressful. The work was not particularly difficult, but the pressure to get things done was immense. Upper management doesn't respect the input provided by the average worker (e.g., schedules are completely tops down driven). The evaluation system is not particularly fair. Unless you work like crazy, in a highly visible area, forget about getting a good review. Make very good and solid contributions, and you're left behind. It is also very dependent upon how well your manager represents you. Bad manager = bad rating = fear of layoff. If you can play the game and put up with the stress, the pay is very good."
good,"In my position there wasn't a ""typical"" day as we worked in a fast-paced, ever changing environment. I enjoyed building relationships and partnering with Sales Teams & multiple groups across Intel (Finance, Operations, HR, Comp & Ben, IT, and Business Units). I also thrived on variety of responsibilities, opportunities to learn new things and grow expertise. Not very many dull moments."
good,Intel has many things to offer- however they need to develop a new model for how they manage & develop people. They send people to the same change management classes they use for their widgets. People are NOT widgets.
good,"The people are great at Intel but you are constantly worried about getting laid off. Its always possible to save money. If you are transfered to the wrong team or fall ill and have a poor focal you can get laid off. They have really come up with innovative ways to cut US heads and now are doing it in other countries. You will work at least 50 hours a week but you'll have options to move to new teams and learn new tech. I recommend you only stay in a job for 3 years then keep moving. Its the only way to move up unless you are patient. If you are a good worker they won't do good promos because they want you to stay in the same role. This company has peaked as far as stock price so the stock grants aren't close to what they used to be. I would recommend working for another tech firm if you are an IT pro. This is not an IT company. They are centered around manufacturing. If they can save money by cutting IT heads they will. the CEO is always trying to get the stock price up and the only way they can really get increased revenue is by cutting heads, at least that's what they seem to think. Salary seems to start low but raises are decent each year. They keep cutting the bonus program and there's no more on call pay so it took me till year 7 to make as much as I was when i was on call years 1-3. Still I did enjoy my time there but I was very sick for 9 months and took MLOA. I had a very avg focal but that was to be expected. Next year they said anyone with low stock grants were laid off and with that I was gone after 15 years. Don't get sick if you work there! I'm not bitter as I'm"
good,"As a contractor, you get pretty much what you came in for, nothing more, nothing less...a lot less room for career advancement these days than there used to be"
good,Fast paced working environment but do not treat contractors well. You learn a lot but you're only there for maximum of 18 months. No benefits...no paid time off
good,Managers are not so great. Do not treat employees with respect. Some are not open for discussion and call employees to warn about to not discuss product related issues.
good,"This was my first job in the semiconductor industry.  Some of my co-workers complained about the pay, but it was a big step up from electronics."
good,I wish not to comment too much on the company. They tend to not allow you to express your true feelings.Only thing great about the place is the people.
good,Well Intel is the poster child for chew em up and spit em out but if you can hang in a company full of A type personalities and can hold your own in constructive confrontations you wont be disappointed with the experience you gain by working there.
good,"Very competitive environment, not a fun place to work, Big company with lots of people going about their own business, and not interacting with others. I did not find my time there enjoyable."
good,i worked for intel in rio rancho from 1997 to 2009. at the height of my employment the headcount was around 5500 people on campus. now it is hovering around 1200. they've had layoffs since 2007 that decimated the lives of many past employees. now they have been advertising for manufacturing techs. for the past year. obviously past employees have moved on with their lives and no longer want to work in such an unstable company.
good,The company is very top heavy and as an engineer you will reach a point where you are either waiting for someone to retire to have career opportunities or you change to a different organization which usually requires throwing away your expertise and starting over again.  Salary starts off good but then begin to stagnate after 10 years which is a good time to look for another company to work for.
good,"Intel Labs Europe have some really smart people. A lot of management and a lot of big company process which can slow things down. A good manager who can help you move past this is key. If you get a good manager, its a great place to work. A bad manager, and forget it."
good,I worked for a subcontractor and the pay was not as good as an Intel employee.  My benefits were based on the subcontractor.  There was not an opportunity to become full time under Intel.
good,"Intel is a somewhat stressful place to work with a big emphasis on creating disparity within the employees. They expend an enormous amount of management effort to pull people into low performance bands to hit arbitrary quotas. During review time, employees are highly encouraged to say negative things about their peers to give the management some ammo to justify bad ratings. This tends to create a culture where cooperation is difficult. If management would focus instead on treating people fairly and working to mentor or help those with low performance instead of trying to brand good performers as poor performers, Intel would be a respectable place to work."
good,Intel was ok but since I worked for a Temp. service while working there I didn't have a chance to actually experience all the benefits of such a great company. I worked through Kelly Services and they were very disorganized and they didn't care about their employees whatsoever.
good,Intel culture does not empower collaborating... The focus on costs creates high level of job insecurity. Enjoyed all my co-workers. Trust issues with the executive leadership
good,"Very strong compensation benefits. Marketing roles require travelling. Every campus in Portland has the gym, exercise related facilities in it."
good,"Currently working in a split team with two managers, but the power dynamics are very apparently in the other half's favor. Because of that imbalance, tend to get stuck with grunt work and diminishing headcount as other half grows in opportunity and workforce."
good,"Every single day is a new adventure.  You work hard, your manager never gives credit for your hard work.  You'll work hard and many hours.  Someone will always take credit for the work you do."
good,"Intel culture forces each engineer to against each other.  There is no team work.  At the end of the year, whoever gets the lowest performance grade (within their group), the one gets booted. Thus, no one wants to share anything."
good,"Management is lacking people skills!  Daily goals are very high ! "
good,Challenging work and interesting topics explored. Demanding On-Call that can interfere heavily with work life balance. Competitive benefits and good stock options.
good,"I was at Intel as a contract employee - which is basically a second-rate citizen.  Contract employees have no benefits whatsoever, nor are they allowed to any of the perks on campus, including free coffee.   The management treats you like a lesser, unimportant person.   I enjoyed my actual job, and the work I did, but I never felt respected or important.  When my contract ended, I was just gone - no goodbye whatsoever."
good,"Had a great 20 years until they ended my employment during a downsizing 6 months short of retirement eligibility.  Not a performance problem and was replaced by two lesser paid people.  The company is a one trick pony and the CPU market overall is shrinking.  They have few if any alternatives in the pipeline, so layoffs will be a regular thing."
good,"Embedded Employee, has its ups and downs but lacks advancement and development. Actual employer is ICLP and not Intel. Hard to feel like i am part of the team."
good,Large corporation with very good compensation and benefits.  Their ability to do workforce planning and handling of employee retention leaves a lot to be desired.
good,"Pros:"
good,The ideas are great and the people are good to work with but projects and the groups don't stick and everyone is trying to save themselves. So lots of people trying to do that same thing and go after the shiny penny.
good,"Company push a project very hard, it is hard to find balance of family and life here. If you have a kid, and want to have work and family balance life, it is hard to do"
good,"If you aren't an engineer or in marketing, the management treats you like a dog. They make lots of promises to get you to sign a contract, and then afterwards tell you that your job benefits doesn't include the things they've promised you."
good,"Intel was a great place to work for 21 years.  I learned that I could move all over the company and see how different aspects of the business could work.  Schedule is KING - and we drove our people pretty hard."
good,"With the right management, work/life balance can be achieved, however overall job duties are nearly always in conflict with that as ""skeleton crew"" is the norm in the engineering environment."
good,"Excellent place to work, due to the flexibility and availability of tele-commuting capabilities. The ""GPTW"" is traded for a below market salary, and minimal job security in uncertain times for the company. Years of poor choices have not forced organization to gut the experience from the company by forcing most employees within retirement age to leave."
good,The semiconductor industry is facing fundamental technology challenges. Intel as the dominant player is trying to figure out the directions for going forward. The current top management team has not been able to answer many serious questions inside and outside of the company.
good,"I was thrilled to work there. My kids love watching the commercials and I was filled with mixed feelings every time they pointed out one of the stickers. If they only knew about how hard everyone needs to work there just to maintain sanity. Every month and project we are tasked with doing more with less resources. Not just software, but people (people who have experience or at least the desire to learn)."
good,"SOP expected is unrealistic in certain groups within"
good,No long term assessment on where employees would like to go. work life balance is not studied and paid attention to. managers pick their group leaders based on personal friendship rather than qualifications.
good,"The company has many talented employees but not nearly enough opportunities for them. Intel has an up or out process, but that stopped working once there was no more up. The pay and benefits are excellent, but the stress level is extreme."
good,"Kept busy from dawn till dusk."
good,Nice learning environment. strict dead lines. Nice cafeteria.
good,Bonne entreprise les animations et les formations très enrichissante.
good,"•a typical day at work"
good,"a typical day is coming in at 5:45 getting our assignments for the day and doing a pm or two."
good,"Being the largest site in the state, 2 million plus square feet, there was no such thing as a typical work day."
good,"Large complex organization with many locations: There is poor communication about goals and expectations. Usually the pay is good, but industrial environment is not for everyone."
good,"Day typically started around 9 am. I checked my emails to see if there were any systems that went down during the night. If so, then I would fix the systems and put them back in automation. During my time there I learned a lot about Python script and how to fix open systems with technical issues. I got along very well with my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was leaving it. The most enjoyable part was dealing with all the problems that I faced on a day to day basis and the knowledge I gain from being exposed to these problems."
good,"A typical day at work was spent operating large machines to coat or develop 12"" wafers."
good,Pricing strategies for products support.
good,"Pros - great brand and reputation, Folsom is cheaper than a Silicon Valley, on campus gym, many career support programs, opportunities to learn new technologies, good salary and bonuses."
good,"Frequent re orgs. Unfortunately IT is always treated as a cost center not a strategic asset, hence the victim of perpetual cost cutting."
good,"Good company - I may apply there again. Very good place to work for engineers.  The provide great benefits and good perks, plus you have the opportunity to advance."
good,"It has been a while since I worked there and since then, the fab has been transferred over to other companies to develop flash memory so this review is likely not relevant anymore."
good,Develop methodologies to achieve the best performing FFT. Publish papers in conferences and Journals. File patents. Fix bugs & participate in technical discussions.
good,"A very challenging environment. Focal / performance management is a huge de-motivator. Constant re-orgs is an issue, which leaves employees very confused"
good,"My previous employer Via Telecom was acquired by Intel."
good,It was great to work at Intel. Team depends on the project and the people you work with. Made real good friends and learned new technologies while working there.
good,"Intel has great wages and benefits.  Working experience varies greatly depending on which business unit you work in.  The company re-organizes every year or two, which creates chaos.  Layoffs happen routinely every several years."
good,"I worked my behind off for the department I worked in only to get laid off and taken away the chance to ever work there again. So I have absolutely nothing helpful to say as far as working at Intel.  Wish things would have ended differently but they obviously don't care about their employees just the bottom line.  The least they could have done, was give prior notice to the layoff.  Not every company does this, but in my mind, a truly ethical one does."
good,"Great company with competitive benefits. People are nice, however career advancement is a non starter without at least a masters degree to even move into low level management. That said a typical day is spent behind a computer for 12 hours. The hardest part of the job is the time away from family, especially on night shift, with no option to move shifts without doctors direction. Management is also hit and miss. The best part of the job is the people who work at Intel. For the most part they are a great community of folks from around the world with very few bad apples."
good,"Multiple groups restructures in little time, not chance to adapt, management only takes decisions based on their fillings not real productivity taken into consideration"
good,"Don't seem to know how good things are, too much focus on not being strong in mobile."
good,"Competitive"
good,"If you need a paycheck and don't mind keeping your head down, then Intel is a good place for you."
good,it really depends on which group one is in.  Certain groups would have innovative and creative design environment that is attracting many engineers who are eager to learn and expand their career path
good,"The company was mediocre, the manager was assuming and un-understanding. It has a lot of layoffs, especially the Indian offices. I strongly disapprove of the CEO."
good,"work is dynamic. constantly change the direction and focus. management changes frequently also. new technology, new thinking, new skillset. i want a stable environment with career advancement."
good,"The culture in Folsom campus was challenging.  The company was wonderful however, the Folsom campus wasn't a live place to work. People weren't cultivating."
good,"Benefits are amazing they take good care of employees, but the sacrifice is great on your family/work life balance. Heavy price paid to stay employed."
good,Long hours and very competitive. They have a great culture for the new hires out of college. They tend to have layoffs every few years. That alone was very stressful
good,Intel always was a very isolated place. Surprising for a technology provider that depends on other OEMs to integrate their products. They completely missed the boat on mobile because of this.
good,"Working at Intel use to be fun and rewarding. However, with changes over the past several years, it has become grueling hard work with limited resources needed to get the job done"
good,"Very competitive, stressful, cut-throat work environment - Difficult to switch to different roles without risking career with company.  Training and management mentoring/training poor.  Too much change to maintain work/life balance."
good,"Don't even think to make friends at work. Especially within the same group. Culture is ""your failure is my success.  Not necessary I really make lots of contributions to project success. As long as I know how to BS or shoe polishing will secure my position""."
good,"The company is more Baby Boomer to Gen X in its workforce, and the culture reflects that. Executives are almost always older lifers, and the few new faces are equally old. No possibility to advance if you aren't from tech's preferred demographics. If you want a job that isn't challenging that you might be able to keep for 30 years while being rather average, it's a good place to be. I'm not overwhelmed with the skill or intelligence of the leaders, but most of the tech companies are like this...lots of hype and not a lot of substance."
good,"Intel offered many employee perks, including an on-site gym, but were only available to full employees not contractors.  A great place to work to learn new technologies."
good,"Management for the group in which I contributed was extremely poor, failing completely to read the market place and move accordingly. (The minions at the bottom, myself included, those that did all the work, created the products, and nurtured them to release and mass production, where great, highly skilled and competent people. They were the complete antithesis of the top management.) The result: significant layoffs (>65%) in August, '17; the group will most likely disappear completely at the end of the 2017. The group's top management will most likely be reassigned to other parts of the company where they can continue to wreak havoc and destroy other product groups. The Peter-Principle is alive and well!"
good,Integration of new employees and finding best person for each job falls short of expectations.  There is limited upward mobility and the majority of people are satisfied with not taking on more responsibility.
good,Can be challenging depending on the group you are in.  There is always something to learn and the company is at the forefront of changes that will be impacting our world.
good,"On the good side, Intel pays well (and very well depending on the location you are in). Benefits programs are generous. "
good,intel had many great benefits and during the first 10 yrs I worked there was very secure. during the last 13 yrs it was increasingly insecure.. lay off seemed like an every other year thing. never knowing for sure how the next lay off would effect you.
good,"Need to discuss mentality of managers.  Managers also needs to handle or own technical areas."
good,Overall there are some very nice manager types that follow processes to the letter and don't let anyone else fool around and think they can get away with otherwise. Others break the rules quite often and break not only processes but also basic Intel policies of being able to track every release.
good,"I worked at a FTE for 4 years then worked as a contractor. I was an equal contributor and peer among my team (as an Intel employee-FTE). I enjoyed working across teams to manage many facility related projects. Management care and concern began to decline with outsourcing activity that resulted in eliminating my role altogether. I thoroughly enjoyed my time as FTE."
good,"Intel is made up of a number of business teams.  Depending on which one you work for at any given time, they are a pretty good organization to work for however, they do tend to layoff their most senior people every few years to save a buck so it's not a place you want to work long term.  Work life balance is talked about however most everyone puts in 50-70 hours a week depending upon your role. Great technical shop to work and learn new skills."
good,"Set up logs to work on for the day."
good,"Competitive work environment with good pay and benefits. They have a culture that promotes teamwork, however, you are rated in comparison to your teammates which creates a stressful review process because you feel you have to perform better than everyone else."
good,"Intel is trying its best to keep up with the rest of SV.  Noble efforts - keep trying.  The people are amazing.  If you're in RNB, it's a but old and dated.  Cafeteria is scary at times."
good,Mi paso por Intel fue de aprendizaje y crecimiento.
good,"New department so expectations and requirements were fluid if not vapor. "
good,"Management in the IT department has gone off the rails.  They are desperate to look good on their review at any cost, including making the jobs of individual contributors a living nightmare.  If you like constant strife then please feel free to join the Intel IT culture.  Your co-workers are essentially your competitors when it comes to yearly ranking and ratings.  As you can imagine, that leads to a culture of me first everyone else second."
good,"Intel is a place good for new grads. it gives very good, systemetic training, which will benifit all the empoyees the whole life. not many companies can do that. Intel also has very good benifits. Intel' stock is a good way to pay the employees with extra money. Health insurance plan is also superior."
good,A lot of flexibility on working hours and the benefits package is better than most.  First line managers are usually good and co-workers are great.
good,"Intel provides great benefits, however the culture varies from org to org.  The only consistent thing is the poor management who have no idea of how to develop, maintain and grow the talent they have."
good,"The north Austin site for the Network Access Division was formerly Jato Tech (then bought by Level One, then Intel bought Level One).  The north Austin campus was competing with the Jones Farm campus in Hillsboro, Oregon.  Caught in the middle of directional control, the north Austin site and staff eventually disappeared."
good,"Ambiente tranquillo e sereno,orario ottimale,colleghi simpatici e gioviali e qui ho imparato come gestire un magazzino di logistica.La struttura viene gestita in maniera snella e fluida da personale qualificato"
good,"My team had 5 managers during two years period.  A team of 6 engineers disappeared in about 1 year;  either transferred to other part of company, or found job outside the company, or got laid off."
good,"Long hours, but most IT jobs do have long hours, often times projects overlap causing extra work but again that is normal. On call nights can be brutal in a global company, and after hour meetings can sometime get tiring if you don't manage your meeting schedule correctly."
good,Established company with everything available that you might need.  To large to make a difference.  Felt that career advancement was slow.
good,"Intel middle management is lost and terrified. They don't know how to challenge senior managers with data and have become accustomed to responding with supportive data no matter the cost of exposing the truth. "
good,Overall a good company with the typical corporate challenges and rewards.  Work hard and deliver well and you will not have issues.
good,"Presently  working in Intel computer Centre  as a Software engineer        "
good,"Very big on safety and following the rules, lots of different positions at the company. The company even pays for your schooling."
good,"Intel bought McAfee in 2010. An announcement in 2014 was made that this group would be called Intel Security going forward."
good,"From my perspective, Intel is currently using a very large group of temp to hire contract employees that will most likely never be given the moral opportunity to be hired on as long-term personnel."
good,"Jobs is great, fun and challenging.  "
good,"Best friends to work with ever"
good,"If you want to work with the best, Intel is the place to work."
good,"worked as a contractor supporting software development projects in semiconductor test labs.  Intel policies require a definite separation between contractor and Intel employees.  Employees are friendly and helpful.  Be prepared to get thrown into the deep end of the lake and be evaluated for how you swim to shore.  If you can make it, you are in, as far as staying on until your contract terminates."
good,"Good place to learn, decent environment."
good,"The job was fun to do its self. However, the people that train you were not training properly and when you try to tell the managers that this is how you were trained they did not want to listen or help you get the right training that you need, they would rather let you go then fix the problem as if they were to busy for their employee's. The other problem they had was once they did find out that it was the trainer, they wanted the employees help on the situation of everything she or he taught you so they could really see what you were taught. Basically they only wanted to listen to you when it was to late and the employee was no longer working there and even then they refused to rehire and train the person right."
good,I learned how to control a large crowd and how to secure terminals and passengers ships efficiently. 
good,"my relation with my co-worker is very friendly"
good,"I found the opportunities to try different roles, travel the world, and meet people across the range of different industries a real benefit of working for Intel. "
good,"Management does not follow their own code of conduct, there is favortism and corruptness going on in some departments, unfortuneately I fell into one of them."
good,-Tracked and distributed new Network software to Intel Sites world-wide
good,- Leader Si tech company
good,Sustainability and shareholders profit is first and nothing else. Inclusion? It’s easier to create a web page with the word and than acting upon it. After awhile you feel unappreciated and find yourself in rut thinking you’re not performing like a rock star. Lots of cliques. Hope to pair up with one or you might get laid off on the next budget hearing.
good,"... in the recent past too many headcount reductions, as well as attrition, and people simply not being paid industry standard (not even close in some fields) have led to dissatisfaction among employees. Often times employees don't really know what the management wants, and directions are changed too often. And they finally need to own up to it and pay their employees industry standard. Or keep watching them leave."
good,"Constant meetings at various levels, some necessary, some just for information and others that could have been simplified or consolidated. Keeping meetings running as scheduled (starting and ending on time) was also a challenge."
good,Excessively bureaucratic sometimes.  Rigid rules and work culture.  Politics.  Sometimes you have to go along to get along.  Good funding.  Very stable company.  The bonuses are very consistent in good economy
good,"It was great getting 40 hours a week for a few months and getting extended- Initially I was a temp for hire for a month over the summer, and then extended (currently, I am extended till end of the year). I enjoyed my job thoroughly at the beginning when I was working under a different manager but when I got extended for a separate project under different leadership, that is when it got downhill. I felt that I became very stressed and lacked job security/stability as it was harder to communicate and connect with my new boss. I believe there was a miscommunication of my own skills and experience as I mainly worked with basic data entry at the beginning, which then my role became unclear to handling wikis/more web design based? Overall, I did enjoy getting weekends off and having the standard 8-5, and they were accepting of my work hours (I am still a full time University student thus can only work up to 25 hours per week during school). I became very stressed on what I would work on near the end and continue to be as I have lacked communication with my managers. In the end, it was a great temp. job when I quit my retail job but it became very stressful overtime. This is based off of my own experience though, and can vary from someone who was not a contingent worker."
good,"Work aimed more at workers from overseas plants. Promised contract time, then turned it over to people that upgraded other country's plants, not exactly as agreed. Bonus to leave an old job at the end of the previous contract, then out the door in bunches on a "
good,"Intel is no longer the company I went to work for in the early 2000's.  The values they purport no longer ring true now that there isn't a founder in the driver's seat of the company.  Random job cuts are a norm at Intel and are not driven by business need or job deletion or creation."
good,"Lamentablemente me encontraba como recurso outsourcing, por lo qeu no no me fue posible disfrutar de todos los beneficios como empleado de Intel"
good,"Work was challenging, but rewarding. "
good,After CEO was fired they started a reorg that resulted in: delay in replacing old computers and servers that hurt work; minimum or no salary increase that resulted in all smart ppl find another job; hire freeze that resulted increase workload for those who stayed behind. Intel has new buildings and many cubicles empty but lot of ppl squeezed two in one desk working underground due to poor space management.
good,"Great Place to work if you can navigate to right org/group. Inconsistent practices between sites, groups, and areas makes for a frustrating and sometimes wasteful experience."
good,I've worked 2 six month contracts at Intel corp. I seem to never fail to get a supervisor or manager that has anger problems or some other behavioral shortage. Now these guys I'm speaking of were mid to high level managers. From what I've seen thus far you would have to be lucky to get a good fit there as a contractor. Many there treat all of the contractors like second class and I'm surprised they didn't make the green badge employees use separated bathrooms and drinking fountains. I'm sure that this isn't true for all who work there but this has been my truthful experience.
good,"Great Place to work because of the people, but management only seems to care about how many headcount can be reduced.  Focus on valuing the employees has fallen off scope."
good,"Well paying jobs, only the paranoid survive.  This is a long standing mantra at Intel and I can say for 28 years i have been paranoid about losing my job and it finally happened."
good,"The pay and benefits are great, but Intel can create a toxic culture where work and lift are difficult to balance. People are high strung and angry.  Resources for advancement do not exist easily and top-down culture is toxic."
good,Ønsker ikke at anmelde noget på nuværende tidspunkt
good,"- Decent compensation and benefits for new employees"
good,"Large company with typical corporate culture. No matter how good or skillful and hard working you are, at the end of the day you are just a number and can be replaced easily."
good,"PROS:"
good,"There are a lot of things that Intel Finance employees do that are unnecessary and the organization is working to eliminate these activities but the process is slow. If Intel can work to improve its overall culture and financial accuracy and planning, it will be a much better environment to work in."
good,"As a contract worker, I would say that the treatment is generally unfair, but not poor. Contract workers receive most of the blame when a project fails. Permanent employees are treated well, however, often with quarterly events and trips, free family events, and fruit and beverages."
good,"Intel lacks planning, unrealistic deadlines are set. Always in deadline mode, always just try to get things make it work,"
good,"Depends on the manager. If you are lucky and have a good manager, its the very best place to work and you will have many opportunities to grow in your career."
good,"A good place to work."
good,"Intel is a serious old boys network.  Notwithstanding the hype about their diversity programs, the environment can be challenging if you're not one of the boys."
good,"Some amazing leader and some not so good at all."
good,I have worked at Intel as a direct employee and eight times as a contractor. They treat contingent workers as second class citizens but working as direct employees has its neagatives as well.
good,"Intel used to be an awesome place to work, but then was clouded by repeated, brutal layoffs which killed the culture.  Intel lost it's competitive advantage of process leadership recently and seems to be floundering on where to focus next, with no real leadership driving the company forward.  The culture is suffering due to those reasons."
good,The work and environment was good but I didn't learn much beyond the specific tasks I was given.  The people I worked with were nice and helpful.  I encountered some pretty bad micromanagement.  The process to get document access was very long.
good,Great time off but the company lacks fair compensation and advancement. I feel like I am under valued as a experienced technician. I wouldn't say its a bad place to work but i feel like I am worth more.
good,"Busy but depend on groups and manager."
good,"This position allows me to enrich the lives of those who normally do not know the difference between an AMD processor and an INTEL. Education of a product is the key to entice the minds of those who normally would not buy because they lack the knowledge of what is being presented to them by the INTEL Rep. "
good,Poor Management that leads to frustration and good people leaving either the team or the company. The experience is very dependent on the Head of the Team so the generic Intel culture does not trickle down.
good,"This is a very demamding environment yet the chances to learn are huge and if you  like challenges of that nature, you will be thrilled to be part of the organization."
good,"I have no response, at the end of my career I was in a Hostile work environment and I was mot able to report any hostility I was risking my job and future at Intel, so I left my job."
good,"Everything is so automated that new employees have no idea where  to get the tools to get things accomplished for their job or personally. "
good,"Intel is a money making company and has no loyalty to their employees.  They lay off employees that have worked there for over 20 years just so they can bring in younger employees.  No criteria is set just laid off because. Aside from that they have you sign a waiver stating that you're not eligible for rehire and if you don't sign it you don't get your severence package. You're not even allowed to return as a contractor.  This makes it very hard to seek another job as one of the questions asked when employers call for a reference is, are they eligible for rehire.  Well that sets a question in mind when Intel says no."
good,"Very exciting work environment with costant changes."
good,"great place and people, Issue isin IT support is the constant push to move service to other teams leaves huge loads on employees who are challenged with work life balance conflicts while the focal process only measures a employees project work rather than operational duties which involve on call of after hours work"
good,"Excellent ""Total Compensation"" Pkg. Very competitive. The site support (CS) group has truly developed a support infrastructure that makes Intel a ""Great Place to Work""..as other industry leaders have done, like Google, Facebook, etc. Health facilities with onsite doctors, nurses, physical therapists, gym facilities with locker rooms, full service cafeterias, banks, rec rooms, etc. etc."
good,"Quite at times, people aren't always friendly. It's stressful at times as well. The only good thing is that it pays well and the benefits of it. Another bad thing is that once you graduate you can't intern here."
good,"They advertise it's such a great place to work, while in reality, they have a toxic work environment. Funny thing is that among coworkers we always refer to the management as ""They"", as if the management they are not with us as a team. And I heard on the spot during the worldwide BUM meeting by the CEO, there was one brave sole in the live audience who brought up a question about Intel's toxic work environment, which the CEO of course dismissed the question, no, our environment is not toxic. I am pretty sure that employee was shown the door right after that meeting."
good,I have worked for several managers and three different groups at Intel. Your experience varies greatly on the management and group you are in. It is hard to generalize. Overall the company and benefits are great
good,"Learned process of making a computer chip."
good,"Intel has outstanding processes and work ethic. Generally speaking, people are smart, hardworking and honest. There are limited opportunities to grow because it is a mature company."
good,Pays well.  The company is going through a lot of changes so it is a very dynamic environment.  Work can be stressful but a lot of mentorship available.
good,"Intel is a great place to work from the standpoint of compensation, the people are smart, and some interesting work.  Some will find it difficult to advance. Navigating the focal process (yearly performance review) is very annoying.  Intel tends to value visibility at  above work performance.  Meaning you could do your assigned job better than anyone has ever done it and if that work is not visible to your managers manager - it is as if it didn't happen.  As a mechanical engineer If you want to work on lots of cool stuff that is unlikely to ever make it outside the walls of Intel - it's perfect."
good,"a good place to work. Except if you're a green badge, then you are not treated very well. Other than that is a good place to work when they are laying people off."
good,"Can be a nice cushy job, but good luck with job advancement and raises.  In 2016, Intel broke it's all-time revenue, yet many people reported minimal raises (like 2%)."
good,"Good Work life balance, Helpful co-workers, but lack vision and need to improve on Management Decision Making. Too many managers doing same work everyday on less number of Engineers, thats the biggest problem, optimization is required."
good,"Intel NM has very good working hours flexibility with acceptable holiday and vacation policy. Management at Intel varies depending on who your boss is but in most cases they are supportive of what new skills you would like to obtain, ie. green belt certification. "
good,"Analyzed commodity and service spending, supplier cost, and consumption data across the supply line to drive cost saving initiatives that drive increased supplier/vendor cost savings, increased equipment availability, inventory tracking and reduction, and material management strategies for the New Mexico location."
good,Didn't like it. Management is haphazard. No direction for interns. Waste of time. gained no experience. Must have a good plan of action when they hire interns. Think this is only at San DIego office.
good,"I've worked several start ups and several large established companies. Intel is a good company to work for only if you are willing to put forth long work hours, particularly the department I am in (iCDG). The  company often change management which means don't expect your manage to have your best interest because of the constant management change. Most people are constantly on their feet and don't have time to chitchat. Company is very lean on stock award but the quarterly and annual bonuses are good."
good,"I was employed by Intel for 20 years.  The first 10 years were pretty great until the layoffs began.  Approximately every other year, there would be a layoff.  Increased automation was partially to blame but the majority was due to jobs moving to other locales."
good,"Some teams get treated like outcast and or it is almost can be a ""cast"" type company in the respect aspects. Some of the teams that people work with can be great and have efficient work ethic's. biggest issue is truly the management"
good,"Business where product is the priority with a culture that is supposed to be employee biased."
good,"Intel senior management has good intentions but the culture doesn't support the proliferation of their ideas.  Middle and lower management are generally poorly trained and that can impact your career unless you are savvy enough to maneuver around them.  But there are some real gems working at Intel, the benefits are great, and the opportunities can be rather exciting."
good,"I spent about 15 years working at Intel and what I learned from the time spent there is that Intel is abandoning a people centeric culture  and adapting  ""use and abuse"" mentality towards its employees.  They have made bad deals and brought on questionable COEs which has cost of millions of dollars (and the trend is continuing) and as a result Intel's workforce has seen some of the worse layoffs in its history.  Basically, Intel has become a hostile, cut throat kind of environment that fear seems to control."
good,great place to work. many opportunities to learn new skills. Provided several growth opportunities. I enjoyed my time working there and woudl recommend it.
good,"Good people, average management.  Slow decision making, bureaucratic culture, but great co workers and still leading edge process technology"
good,"Good work life balance, "
good,"Intel is a quick paced, highly demanding work place.  The people who work for this company are highly qualified individuals yet the merit system lacks in that it is done on a bell shape curve requiring someone to be targeted for improvements even though all employees may be peforming at stellar levels.  As with all large companies, there are both good and bad managers and it appears that managerial personnel are selected based on their ability to sell themselves rather than on their qualifications.  The hardest part of the job is maintaining a good relationship with your manager so that during focal reviews, you are not targeted for improvement.  The most enjoyable aspect of the job is the work itself, which is usually highly rewarding as results are seen immediately."
good,"Once an elite employer in the tech market.  Leader in innovation and market direction.  Now focused on money, and less on innovation.  Current leadership not in tune with customers, OEMs or tech direction."
good,"Nothing else to say.  Its changed over the time I spent there.  They don't care about their workers anymore.  Nothing else to say,"
good,Work place can be more productive. Mentoring could have been better. Team with which we join matters a lot for improving one's skill set.
good,Compensation / benefits are good and have fun with people but job work / life balance is bad. I think it is tough to survive there.
good,Although the benefits are above average many of the working conditions are not.  Management does not value non-exempts.  They would cut head count in favor of bottom line and expect those remaining to maintain the same amount of equipment with fewer people creating safety concerns.
good,the company pay very low and dont  care about their employments. its get slow end of the year and they start laid of people. the job security is not demand. they always cut of people
good,"compress work weeks are great."
good,"Great place to work if they paid better and you love OT!"
good,A very interesting and challenging job that has opportunities if you have the right education background.  The company seems to treat it employees well for the most part and tries to impress upon the work and life balance.  The job does tend to be very specific so when layoffs do occur the skills learned within the company can really only be transferred over to a handful of other companies that are out there.
good,"A stressful day at work. Many challenging opportunities however are typically understaffed in several positions resulting in improper work-life balance. Management understandably look for results to meet delievrables, however do so on the physical and emotional expenses of talents and employees. Coworkers are typically depressed in days of work. The hardest part of the job is to go through management and speak with your ideas freely in an environment of much bureaucracy. The most enjoyable part of the job is that there are a lot of smart people in Intel to work with."
good,Some aspects  were very enjoyable especially the company wide Android build system.   Most people were kind and polite to work with - however the perspective most employees was Intel only.  They has never worked anywhere else and knew no other way to do anything besides the Intel way.  The Intel way might actually be the best way to do something but there was not a broad thought process that there were a lot of different ways to do one thing.
good,"* Hardworking and intelligent co-workers "
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers but unfortunate layoffs every couple of years is the down part of this buisness.
good,"One of the better places to get to know how an American MNC works. Good atmosphere overall, my manager was helpful in coaching and mentoring, especially related to careeer development. Co-workers are helpful as well, especially in need of any help or to start off with."
good,"The combination of instant message, Lync phone , mobile phone, emails and several meetings during the day makes it for a stressful environment, so multi tasking and long hours are the hardest part of the job. "
good,Normal hours are 12 hrs to 18 hrs depending on your position.  Cutbacks and sending jobs overseas has required everyone to take on more responsibility.
good,"I had a unique position in that I investigated and piloted new construction technology. This gave me far more freedom them most to travel, meet with other industry leaders and have a flexible work environment. Typically I would be in the office 3-4 days a week and telecommute the rest except when I was travelling, which was about 30% of the time."
good,Intel is a large global company that is trying very hard to move towards being emploee-centric while remaining technologically cutting edge.
good,You know you are cutting edge when you have to throw away 80% of your work each week.  Learning new technologies as the project direction finds the target can be intense.
good,"Kaffe med kolleguer"
good,"good working hours and salary perks"
good,"In my tenure at Intel, I did appreciate and value the great diversity, the opportunity and ability to learn new things across sever different toolset and to be involved in the success of a working, successful team with an important purpose., the benefits, bonuses and additional perks."
good,"Clean work environment.  However, they treated contractors like a second class citizens.  The company is running by people from other countries and they tend to play favoritism to the people from their same country."
good,I can only speak to the projects I worked on which were pleasant and productive. I worked with a group of editors who assisted technical marketing engineers.
good,"There is not a whole lot at this time to comment since I just began.  However, from the start everyone has one goal which is safety is of highest priority."
good,"Pros:"
good,"Good work culture. Good latest technology work. "
good,"For all the good things it has going for it as a bigger company, it still lacks the speed and autonomy needed in today's tech industry. That's what's allowed companies like AMD to start taking market share. Also, the culture is stuck in the 1990's."
good,It was a tight work area where you had to work hard and get your grades or you would not be there long. And I also found out in the area that I worked in that if the certain ET's did not like you they would find a way to get rid of you.
good,"Working as a contractor: no access to the company's benefits, so I have no opnions on those, it was temporary work, so just focused on finishing the project only."
good,"Intel is looking for affordable employees for this new culture. The older employees are being weeded out yearly to be replenished by younger, less expensive employees."
good,"Es un buen lugar para trabajar, deben mejorar la forma de comunicar estrategias."
good,"* Flexible hour to work"
good,"At Intel, managers and some peers try to prove their worth by displaying their ability to unfairly bring down others - rather than showing their own skills or competence. It's a really sad situation there. Most blue badge tend to think that they are better than green badge employees just because of the color of their badges."
good,"I worked with a great local group of people - dedicated, smart, motivated. Unfortunately changing customer demands and ultra-competitive nature of the business requires a company like Intel to quickly change directions and priorities, resulting in numerous cancelled projects, site closures and perceived uncertainty in one's job status."
good,Being a Green Badge is a mixed bag. It is nice not to be under all of the same stress as the Blue Badge Engineers but the pay wasn't great for the work I was being assigned.
good,"Intel is an amazing (not just great) place to work. It has given me the opportunity to master my skills. However, due to lack of adoption for industry accepted practices in the name of 'we do things like this' and 'we are different' has led to stagnating employee workforce. Super skilled employees are good for Intel but are not prepared for change or outside world. If Intel has to reach the milestones of 30 and 300 (as set by ex-CFO and current CEO) they have to take a very human centric approach. Grow the work force, motivate them and let them flourish under its banner."
good,"Nice pay, great benefits, and tons of time off. However, the culture is very competitive so you had better be good at playing corporate politics. A few areas of the company are somewhat calm and have great teams while others are quite the opposite."
good,"I worked for Intel for over 21 years.  I really liked the previous culture, but lately, they have not done a good job selecting or training managers.  The pay is great if you stay for awhile. Some positions require you to work long hours and weekends.  They are not supportive of telecommuting or working remotely."
good,Good place to work right after college. Good chances to move around to different teams within the organisation and get exposure to different skill sets and job roles.
good,"There are a lot of politics involved that makes it hard for you to just focus on your job. "
good,"* Productive, 8 hours a day."
good,"I only worked at Intel for one summer during an internship.  The company was fun, but they had way too many meetings and presentations.  To get anything accomplished you had to meet on it multiple times with multiple presentations, even as an intern."
good,You can have a decent work-life balance depending upon your individual manager and team. Expect a lot of poiltics. Don't trust upper management. Constant re-organization.
good,"I cannot say anything good, or bad about the company.  It's been too many years, and too many people I worked for are gone.  They do have a nice campus.  Sorry!"
good,Great benefits and career stability. Many employees have been there for years. Culture needs improvement from the top down - strong leadership is coming to help make these changes.
good,"Intel is a great company. My only negative critique is that advancing is difficult. To elaborate, once you’re locked in a position, it’s hard to move up the corporate ladder. Despite that they “encourage” you to challenge yourself, there is no guidelines in order to advance."
good,Intel is a really great place to work for the right person in the right role and right division.  It is such a big company that experiences vary greatly.
good,"Great place to get experience."
good,"They push ""team"", but the only way to get ahead is to lie about and put down your team. Not my specialty. Worked like a dog and made promises throughout the year, then when review comes around they can't seem to remember."
good,The most enjoyable part was seeing the customers face after we completed our installation. I did get boring traveling to customers houses that lived hours away from the company.
good,"I never got a promotion after 10 years of work,  i was doing the job role of a grade 56 Diffusion Maintenance but still being paid a grade 54. Explain that please"
good,"There is a good job work and life balance in the company. Pay is at medium range compared to other companies in Silicon Valley. In overall, Intel is a mid-level company to work for."
good,I provided assistance to kids and their parent for on line schooling I aid them with enrollment and scheduling sessions with their school Guidance Counselor
good,This is a very old and studious workspace with very little time and availability to have a decent work life balance. Not sure what the entire experience was but my manager was extremely work intensive.
good,Great company until your project gets killed then they say 2 mos to find a job but all reqs internal are frozen so it's like a catch 22 other than that not bad
good,"Intel is able to hire more than other employers in the area.  it hires a large number of employee from outside of area.  If candidates find a good manager and a good team (that is hard to find at Intel culture) it is a very good place to work.  It is very competitive and at times can be very stressful (compared to other employers), but good team and a good manager can reduce the stress significantly.  Intel needs to promote teamwork (use successful teams as example) by developing a more effective focal reviews for employees.  The existing process creates more competition within teams that works against teamwork reducing team synergy and thus productivity."
good,"I gained a lot of great experience at Intel.  At the end of the day, I struggled to find relevance in what I was doing and how it really contributed to the performance of the company.  However, it is a great, stable and generous company."
good,"The company overall is very strong among the Semiconductor industries. Semiconductor innovation happened here. This is a cutting edge technological company for the future."
good,"On the first day you arrive, you discover that over your cubicle hands a huge green sign that says ""CONTRACTOR"". It serves no purpose other than to apply the corporate social stigma. It might as well say ""Leper."""
good,"While Intel does not provide the highest pay, they do have wonderful benefits and other perks. This makes for a very safe and secure environment for those looking to develop skills or to secure a comfortable retirement. With the policy of hiring from within and the multitude of business groups, there is a lot of opportunity for lateral movement allowing one to better figure out on what they want to focus."
good,A cutting edge company that currently lacks decisive leadership. Heavily focused on profit margins in existing business but failed to capitalize on business shifts
good,"Effective management requires a wide range of skills, and each of these skills complements the others. Your goal should be to develop and maintain all of these skills, so that you can help your team accomplish its objectives efficiently and effectively. Read on for ideas and resources that you can use to do this."
good,Engineers collaborating to solve issues. Teleconferencing with suppliers occurs. Meeting rooms to collaborate onsite. All within walking distance to interact with groups
good,"Great company to start career, good work-life balance, supportive management, not too many meetings, opportunity to travel within the United States and even abroad"
good,"Intel is a company filled with very smart people who want to do their best.  However, the company seems to change priorities on a 6-12 month basis, leaving some employees frustrated."
good,"Some teams are great, others are junk. Evaluate carefully which team you are joining and what the management structure looks like. If you end up in a good team, there are infinite possibilities. Also, a bad manager can ruin all the good. Make sure that your manager has your best interest in mind. Some managers are good people, but so dull and demotivated that they will become an impediment to your career growth."
good,"The Intel campus is very attractive, and they offer good benefits and pay for an intern. However, there was a lot of pressure to work long hours and the area I was in was disorganized which made it hard to feel like I was adding anything productive to the team."
good,Good overall but many bad managers.  overall there are a lot of good people trying to do the right thing.  Many people get caught up in just checking the box type management.  TD engineering create an almost hostile work environment where you can work 20 hours straight and still get yelled at for not completing all your work.
good,"Working at Intel was a great way to break into my chosen career field.  What I did not expect was the number of employees on the FAB floor at any given time.  There were hundreds of us there, getting into each other's way and sometimes even making it difficult to get our jobs done in a timely manner."
good,"Intel is an awesome company to work for if you're passionate about hardware, or if you need stability.  If you want excitement though, look elsewhere."
good,"It is difficult to rate a department that no longer exists.  It was a great team while it lasted."
good,"Provides optimum exposure on how different specifications came into existence based on changing needs of computer peripherals."
good,When I started working for Intel it was a place where people had pride in working for a company that made amazing things possible while looking out for its employee's best interests. It was a time when employee morale was relatively high. In the last few years under BK things have been shaken up which has resulted in success for the company but employee morale is extremely low. I think that Intel can find a way to be successful while caring for its employees but that will probably not happen until there is new leadership in place.
good,"Pros:"
good,"The hours offered for work are extremely fair, usually consisting of 12 on 12 off for three days a week, and four the next week. Night shift employees are also offered extra compensation."
good,"Worked under one of the partners. Did a mixture of different projects for court, presentations and research. Staff were friendly and overall had a great time there"
good,Lately there seems to be a lot of uncertainty for Manufacturing Technicians at Intel. We keep getting told different stories from management. It would have been nice to get a consistent message.
good,"Company has tremendous resources available and tries to be inclusive, but occasionally middle management gets in the way and it can be difficult for a technical woman to be recognized."
good,"Intel has a tremendously talented workforce with great assets, but with very poor senior management.  The culture is very  limiting in terms of capturing the full potential of the employees.  The management culture is very political and internally focused.  Informed risk taking is not rewarded which makes for very cumbersome decision making, where the management often makes the wrong decisions"
good,You learned to work on the weekend as if its a part of your normal work week.  When you leave the company you find out other employees are not as dedicated to work the 60-80 hour week.
good,"finance has a rotation program so you try something different every 2 years. Its a large company so you get to try many jobs supporting many groups that make or sell many different products. The bad is that the culture is up or out so even if you find your nitch, you will get pushed to rotate."
good,It is in general a good place to work. Team of smart and hard working people. Work life balance is a the main issue. Otherwise it is a great place with benefits.
good,"Great pay & Benefits. Very relaxed atmosphere, with long shift hours. good time off. co-workers very competitive. Can be chaotic at times or instructions may not be clear."
good,"It's OK at Intel if you are not in hardware but they don't compensate as well as other SW companies. "
good,"friendly employees,"
good,"Having a manager who knew nothing about my position, and I was new and they relied on me to help them understand. To much finger pointing, and throwing people under the bus"
good,It was a great place to work in the beginning. Then it got too big and not employee friendly. The hours and benefits are worth it though. It is hard on the body though.
good,"Good company to start the career. They have one of the best 401K benefits ---Sabbtical holiday is a great perk offered by Intel. "
good,a lot of work.  extra work and stay late!   A lot of good  engineers working late.   Multi worker from all over the world. Free coffee and snack if you come early!
good,"-Working w/ multiple teams in different timezones"
good,"Its gets crazy as the day starts and things get back to normal at the lunch time and day ends at crazy high again. "
good,"It truly was a great place to work, but there was no job security at all. Yu were constantly under the threat of a layoff and eventually you would get snared in a layoff. No one is imune"
good,"Competitive high volume work load , good benefits, time off, Vacation, floating holidays, pool tables video games, time off, BBQ ball games, no parking"
good,"Miscommunication, byzantine management structures, overworked employees too busy to do more than ""good enough"", and a kill-or-be-killed career outlook among Intel lifers make this a frustrating and stressful company for creatively-minded technical millennials."
good,generally ok work environment.  Typically you need a lot of cooperation between different sites to work efficiently. There are also lots of overhead to do work.
good,"good company to work for, good learning opportunities, opportunity work for some advanced technology. Employees are treated well. Good company to start your career."
good,This was a good company to work for. The benefits were great and the name help open doors to places that would not have been opened without it. The teams were not really cohesive.
good,"Poor management direction"
good,"Worked on several strategic projects.  "
good,"I telecommuted my entire employment, which was nice. My immediate manager was great. Far less advancement opportunities than one would expect. Way too much ""big company"" politics for me."
good,"Intel allows you to enjoy your life outside of the workplace. However, the company cuts costs at every corner, often sacrificing some quality  of their products with these decisions."
good,Management was very in tune with what was going on as well as deadlines and ongoing projects/issues. Internal opportunities were available and tele-commuting was an option.
good,"This was once a great place to work. Now it has become obvious that they do not value good employees. It is all about the bottom dollar. You are expected to exceed goals on a daily basis even at the cost of effecting the line and forget about safety. The company once valued safety first, and now hides behind a veil of what it once was. The most enjoyable part of working here were the relationships with good people. Hardest part of the job was not being appreciated."
good,"Work place is flexible. Project orientated, not hour oriented."
good,Intel is a company that is moving away from the desktop and laptop computers due to the changes in the industry.  Intel is trying to figure out the new products and technologies that will carry them forward as a top company.
good,"they need to concentrate on innovations more; in my opinion Intel is becoming a dividend stock in your portfolio, not growth."
good,"Intel keeps trying to hang at the cool kids table, but is not very good at it. They make chips but seem to wish they made cool consumer products. Lots of room to move around and learn new things."
good,"If you work at Intel, you will need to defend your work life balance.  The technology and manufacturing discipline is great.  Culture is quite competitive.  I really liked my teammates but sometimes managers can create division within the group."
good,"this job was really an awesome job, i got to learn about tools and how to properly maintain both intel properties, was always safe when i worked with the tools and learned a lot"
good,The thing I liked the best about my time at Intel was the schedule. I worked 12 hour shifts 3 days the first and 4 days the second. This guaranteed a minimum of 3 days off every week. Intel was extremely focused on safety and rewarded employees who went above and beyond to ensure Intel was a safe place to work.
good,"1. Sustaining tools, monitoring charts, attending meetings, working groups and task forces."
good,"Worklife balance, good company to work, good workplace culture, good exposure to projects and clients, implemented new ideas which worked for company and clients."
good,This place was better place to work. The culture was not good. Management need big improvement to due with employee. More concern about the work balance and environment work place.
good,Management has become very uncaring.  Management has issues that need to be addressed and Intel is a very top heavy corporation.  Lots of manager and not a lot of workers.
good,"Intel is a great place to work. The people are great. You are in control of your work-life balance and career. You learn a lot about yourself and how much you can take as a person - personally and professionally.  If you can work at Intel, you can work virtually anywhere.  All employees I work with are top in their career and their class.  You have to be on all the time. All sites of Intel have a different workplace culture. From experience, the Oregon culture is driven by gray and gloomy days.  Very different from CA and AZ.  The hardest part of the job is to disconnect.  You can get easily wrapped up in exciting details about the project.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the people your work with.  They will make the difference."
good,"Um grande lay-off causado pelas expectativas exageradas criadas pelo CEO, BK."
good,"Your life is Intel's, it is work-work balance, not work-life balance. Even when you put in 80 hours a week it was not acknowledged or appreciated by management."
good,"People are very mediocre..."
good,Intel is too focused on products and not their people. Advancements in career are had to come by and management is not very helpful.  Good work life/balance and compensation is adequate but not stellar.
good,"Intel is a good place to start your career."
good,"A very corporate work culture that loves its constant streams of meetings, and reams of written reports. Little appetite for technical changes (for certain sites), or relies on leadership externally from other sites. "
good,I would show up early and talk about safety issues.  Get pass down on tool sets.  Find out where co-workers are staffed and start my job functions.
good,"-Testing of Intel micro processor chips on the CMT machine and getting a SHMOO graph which needs to be analysed and informs the  output behaviour relating it with the input."
good,"Management continues a desperate drive to recreate $ growth rates of the 1990's.  Groups are spread around the globe.  There are many business efforts competing for corporate budget."
good,"I have been working at Intel Corporation full-time (Less than a year)"
good,"Everything is too good to be true, if you think it is right, but it is too good to be true . remember it"
good,Start out early expect to have meetings around the clock. Your work hard and have to balance meetings around workload. Several of your business partners are globally spread out so you often have early morning 7:00 AM meetings and 9:00 PM meetings. Intel employees work hard and they are good at what they do.
good,Working with staff and maintaining the everyday safety of students and the campus being visible to both and monitoring the hallways.
good,Being in a large company raises the advancement challenges as well as the hierarchy tree to get to a different department for a change. Sometimes need to move to get what you want.
good,"Intel was a good company to work for with great compensation, benefits, etc. I had a lot of flexibility in my work and enjoyed what I did for many years. Unfortunately, I dealt with job uncertainty through downsizing or restructuring every few years. In addition, there was a lot of bureaucracy that often stifled innovation and common sense decision making."
good,I really enjoyed working with Sales and the the combined teams.  Intel has great benefits.  A lot of departments work independently.  The hardest part of the job was the hours that were worked at quarter -end
good,"Company in transition from PC industry to mobile industry."
good,Like everywhere there is good and bad. I met some of the brightest people I ever knew... also met the pettiest. The fast pace environment provides for many opportunities so one is never bored and there is plenty of interesting things to do.
good,My duties ranged from MPC to Planning with a varied amount of work daily. I was able to work with many cultures and people in my years at Intel. I wish to take my skills I learned there and continue to grow.
good,"wrote an emulatior the computer processes. Used C++ to do work, Nice location for the work, They gave me free rain to see what I could do with the emulator. They were pleased with it."
good,"Really enjoyed my position as the managers I had were flexible enough to allow me to share my knowledge with anyone that wanted it.  People I worked with were great, extremely skilled and really passionate about their jobs.  Sadly, most of the skills were wasted as they got lost within such a big company."
good,"Typical day as a manufacturing technician would include setting up activities for engineering, supporting production needs while doing maintenance, troubleshooting tool issues, assisting engineering with projects, attending necessary meetings, with very little time to progress in your own advancements. Always short-staffed and no remedy to resolve large scale issues. Engineering overloaded with own projects so there is no time to address long term production issues in certain areas. Engineering leads are left with way too much on their plate to support the needs of the organization. Turnover in engineering is high due to this specific issue. Co-worker and team building are fantastic and communication is a must to survive this type of environment. If one person is having a hard time, it trickles down to everyone via morale or general operational support. Management is a  mixed bag, some will work side by side to accomplish work, others are never to be seen. Hardest part of job is stress, by far. Best part about job is pay/benefits and co-workers, if you have a good team."
good,"It was good experience and nice culture, I had great co workers and learned a lot while  was working there."
good,Intel is great company with good work-life balance. Being a large company it takes effort to work through management chains to get things rolling.
good,Not much to say about the company. I will give my opinion in person. This will allow for a more organic conversation about Intel Media.
good,"-chance to work on the entire design cycle of the IP"
good,"It was a good place to work and learn all on the job training, it was dangerous job and the pay was low for the kind of job it was."
good,"If you like to work hard with increasing job insecurity, work for Intel.  As belts tighten and the management switched from engineers to bean counters, Intel has become a harder company to work for.  Engineers are treated as if ""Salary"" equates to ""Slavery"".  As a technician, steady work and experience are no longer valued.  If you don't exceed expectations, you will be laid off."
good,"In general, the engineering team was competent, and the individuals were very hard working and dedicated.  The work environment  was professional."
good,"Not sure what they want here, will fill in details later...."
good,"12 hour shifts working on tools, but have to perform jobs outside the scope to be successful."
good,"Love Oregon big trees and the ocean, mountains."
good,A very traditional company where job roles are super streamlined. Lots of opportunities to develop new skills and grow within the company.
good,"Intel is a fun place to work for when you don't have kids. The team where I worked (HIP) are people willing to sacrificed their family and spend most of the time in the lab. Once I become a mom, I couldn't afford to work late nor sacrificed my family, so I had to quit."
good,Good work place and fun filled environment with decent amount red tape politics and it is not about number and good management.
good,"The people you work with are excellent and there is no doubt the semiconductor manufacturing is cutting edge. Company sometimes seems to reach for the ""Next Big Thing"" to add to it's manufacturing portfolio to make up for diminished PC market."
good,"Demanding place to work, and great cooperation.  Most people are great to work with to get the job done.  Where Intel fails is in the upper management.  It is all too easy to be lost and underappreciated in the machine."
good,"I was fortunate enough to work in a group where I get to do everything, just like a start up.  That is what keep me going for more than 15 years there.  Good salary, bonus, and some RSU.  Stock option went up in smoke in 2000."
good,"depeding on the time of quarter bu tusually beginning of quarter as well as end was hectic where i would have to take in extra hours to complete my tasks and meet deadlines, more especially budget spend cut-off dates."
good,"Good place to work."
good,The hardest part of the job was the conflict between family and job because of the long hours. I remember friendly co-workers. Facilities for the employees were great.  The work itself was very satisfying because it was always changing and challenging.
good,"It fully depends on the manager you work for; if not good, you don't get much, or anything out of him/her, but if he/she's good, you can do very successfully."
good,"good coursework"
good,"There are way frequent re-org which makes employee difficult to focus on jobs."
good,"Intel acknowledges the importance of curriculum and research in developing the necessary workforce for the semiconductor industry. With this, the higher education program focuses on enhancing the curriculum development and research capabilities of selected universities in the areas of Science and Engineering."
good,was a place to grow but it did not have enough to motivate the struggles.
good,"I am a contractor. So This is more of a review about Kelly IT. In a regular day, I image many systems and prepare them for events like IDF, Pax, and ISMC. I also image systems for engineering development and Proof of Concept work. In addition to this, I troubleshoot system issues and correct issues that arise with BIOS/UEFI, hardware, and other technical issues."
good,Intel is a large company which can slow the decision and development processes. The options for job opportunities and advancement are well established. The work life balance is stressed for all employees with company and group events for all. The locations of the various sites sometimes made communication and direction for program needs disjointed.
good,Always lots of work to do. Management is strict and people need to work hard.
good,Work Life balance is great. They offer great flexibility and one can work at their own convenience. The management provides the correct tools and training required for your career growth.
good,"lots of resources and training available."
good,I like to work here.I feel I have grown technically and personality wise as well. The trainings made me enhance my skills.
good,Working for a company like Intel is a great experience. Alliance is a safety company that was trying to make it in another state. They didn't have enough work for all their safety people.
good,Company does not pay well at all. I worked there 3 years and never received a raise. They said if I want a raise I need to go into sales. No chance for advancement unless you want to be a sales rep.
good,"You don't have to go out to take a break, just march your steps to the cafeteria. Everyday you will find some activities going on there."
good,"Work/Life balance is good."
good,"Polite Professional working environment with friendly co-workers."
good,"Work from 8am to 6 pm"
good,"I spent 16 years working in the Information Technology department. I gradually worked my way up from an individual contributor engineer to a senior director managing hundreds of employees. The early days of Intel (1990's) was a time of amazing growth and opportunities. But by the time 2004 and later came along, Intel's growth became stagnant, and for folks in the IT department, job security was gone. We started move hundreds of IT jobs to Bangalore India. Intel is still doing so today. I recall one year we had to layoff employees, but I was asked by the then CIO (Sandra Morris - the worst CIO Intel ever had) to go beyond the layoff targets to give us more latitude to hire more people in India. It was about that time Intel lost it's allure for me. I eventually escaped by taking a voluntary separation plan - after landing another job."
good,"It really depends on what group you work at."
good,"Good place to work.  Fast paced, multiple opportunities encompassing many facets of business."
good,"Efficiently Multi Task"
good,"Strong on execution,demanding work culture, structured approach to problem solving"
good,"Intel is a good company to work for, but do not expect to get promoted based on merit/ job performance. In my opinion, too much prestige is granted to advanced degrees- even after a probationary role in a process engineer job where I was highly praised and rewarded for multiple innovations, quick learning, and raw talent, I was not hired simply based on only having a bachelor's instead of a masters of PhD."
good,Very safety oriented culture. Almost obsessive. Forced  to write safety good catches to the point of making them up just to meet your quota.
good,"Creative brainstorming with technical staff and management. Interesting work at the labs, and frequent travel domestically and internationally to various meetings."
good,Not so hot. People are very mioptic and management seems too introverted
good,"The management were good."
good,"•	Deign Automation Support for next generation Graphic design projects in flight."
good,"Making sure the change machines worked properly, and the video games that needed to be repaired were moved aside."
good,"A lot of learning exposure in diverse fields."
good,"The culture is fair but the work is constant,"
good,Lots of potential if executive management can make the much needed changes to improve the culture and raise the bar on employee performance and expectations. That would greatly improve retention /  turnover challenges.
good,"A lot of smart people doing a lot of good work. It is a dog-eat-dog culture and you are on you're own from day one. You need to be an alpha to succeed here. "
good,"Good place to work, however it is a temp. job and can be laid off at any time with zero notice. Zero benefits zero paid time off. "
good,Work Life Balance - need to be managed better. Other than that - it is a great place to learn new skills and experience. 
good,Good place to start your career but do not expect any vertical growth in the organization.
good,Worst work experience I've had in ages. Temporary/Contract workers are relegated to 2nd class status. Entire departments can disappear in a blink of an eye. You are just a color code on a card.
good,"I've worked contract at Intel on an off for about for years. They always presented me with interesting challenges to work on but have yet to put me into a long-term position. Most of the technical folk are pretty easy to get along with but some of the more business oriented folk can lose sight of projects preferring to focus more on what ""looks cool"" than what is actually functional. Some of the folk put in management positions could do with a little bit more technical know-how. Overall, it's a great place to work if you don't mind the occasional confused looks from management."
good,"fast pace, helping buisness except amex in there buisness, data entry, faxing"
good,A company with high level of bureaucracy.Fair life and work balance. Difficult to advance. Hard to bring in changes.
good,"Intel lay offed software engineers once a two? years."
good,I learned many things here. Good environment and nice colleagues there. Many benefits and have a good team. Have nice space area and cafe also have nany variety to eat
good,Intel over the years has been a great place to work. I've developed a vast amount of layout experience from custom digital in my early days to Analog Mixed/Signal.
good,Go to school.  Become an engineer before working here. Training is minimal or Manufacturing Technicians right now.  We're trying to change that.  It's pretty cut throat though so be careful.
good,"This is a competitive company.Obtained broad exposure across all engineering disciplines. Fast paced working environment. Open-door policy, you can talk to your manager most of the time. Lots of learning opportunities. Your work is highly appreciated from your superiors."
good,"Depending on the job, it can be relaxed or stressful. Higher up positions are more stressful than lower. Competition is very high so expect very slow advancement in position and pay."
good,"Overall,  a good company to work for.  Good work/life balance.  Not currently a technology leader.  More focused on hardware than software.  Projects can be cut with no warning, but good severance."
good,"Great work-life balance opportunity."
good,"Free fruit and drinks. Intel is going thru a transformation. Trying to be a data company versus a Chip making company. That means getting involved in sports to collect and generate contents, self driving cars to manage all the data for navigation and entertainment."
good,"Intel is going through a change/transition. Let's see how the company progresses. There is good work like balance here. As a Software Engineer, I feel opportunities to work on latest technology is limited."
good,"I had a great manager, but an absolutely terrible senior technician that worked in my department. He would verbally insult other employees, take process shortcuts and disregard safety regulations regularly. He was regularly reported and reprimanded, but was never fired. Eventually he instructed me to perform a maintenance procedure on a tool without performing electrical lockout/tagout. As Intel corp had recently had a fatality by electric shock for this same discrepancy (not perfoming electrical LOTO), I tendered my resignation."
good,"I'm fortunate that I like my team and value the work we do.  Everyday I get to work with people who are fun, focused, and incredibly knowledgeable.  For that I am grateful."
good,"Because Intel is the leader in their market, they demand near perfection from their employees. This is stressful, but in a way, understandable. With the circuits they build on their wafers being so small, even a minor mistake can be costly. Still, it's often a difficult environment to work in and can be extremely stressful if your primary job is working in the fab, or as an engineer. "
good,"It was generally OK work environment."
good,It was a new business and management didn't have clear goals and expectations. Culture was very competitive. Team culture was encouraged but not really implemented.
good,Work-life balance is very different from group to group. Compensation and benefits are actually good. Management need to improve. Career promotion system is not good.
good,"Big company, lots of growth opportunity.  Competitive work environment.  Workplace culture takes a little getting used to.  Did I say big company already?"
good,Management changes frequently. An unstable work environment is often an occurrence. Interaction with others isnt F2F very often. the pillars expected arent practiced by the company executives. Feeling of isolation is often frequent among workers. Unappealing day to day work environment.
good,Most enjoyable part of the job was learning new techniques with the tools I was being trained on and having the desire to wanting to do my best at the job I was given.
good,"I worked evenings in a bunny suit.  The suit took me awhile to put on and take off up to 8 times a workday.  You walked a lot and stood a lot.  Daily meetings were in the work area and started before I could finish getting the suit on.  Some of the Intel employees themselves could be a real pain to work with as a contractor.  One liked to intimidate and through his weight around.  I have seen this same employee recently at a grocery store, doing the same to the cashier... probably his nature."
good,"Its a corporate atmosphere, I grew up with my Dad working for Intel 35+ years, so I got on with Intel. Promoted quickly, the first 10 years, learned alot and contributed alot. When stock prices fall, they love to ""streamline"" work force, if you make a good wage or are near sabbatical, you better be an essential player. or prepare for voluntary and involuntary seperation notices."
good,Intel Cooperation is one of the more fundamental companies is silicon valley. They have a little ways to go before they are able to compete with the newer culture of technology and its employees. It is still a good launching platform for most individuals starting their IT career.
good,"It was fun when you find your group of people to hang out with - great perks and the GPTW program do make it a great place to work. Ping pong tables, great gyms, great cafeterias, great outdoor areas and facilities make it feel homey and nice. They want you to work hard, and like any big corporation, management can be pretty bad. It was not a bad place overall, but equality, especially with women, still has yet to be seen. Typical patriarchal sort of place."
good,Management had alot of favoritism and unfair annual review process. Very high volume company with overwhelming amount of work not evenly spread throughout four shifts. Major PM's and maintenance was selectively scheduled or left for certain shifts rather than helping educate all shifts to be able to cover all maintenace types.
good,It is an OK company to work for. In general It treats its employees well except for the ACT fiasco in 2016. But the benefits and perks have definitely reduced over time
good,Good Learning ground for fresh graduates who put in the time to   get rewarded. Can feel like old boys club sometimes. Need an advocate/mentor  in management.
good,"My initial assignment was at a separate facility that was well worn and considerably smaller than the main site.  The project was a proof of concept that felt like a start up.  Lots of talented people, long hours, milestones that were expected to be met.  We didn't have the usual perks that trendy silicon valley startups had, but it was still fun. "
good,"Work from 8-5 then take a meeting or 2 at night to update counterparts in India."
good,"The one great thing about working at Intel is that there is no time restriction, no swipe in or swipe out is maintained. You basically work at your own comfort."
good,"I worked at Intel as an intern, but even so I found myself working outside of work hours. However, your workload depends on your manager and unfortunately I got I a very strict one."
good,"Você será considerado como um mero headcount, por mais que vc performe muito bem."
good,I worked at a startup and it was acquired by Intel. Part of the acquisition contract was that the Softcom Employees would be integrated into jobs at Intel for at least 3 years.
good,"Daily work involves email, phone meeting, and face to face interactions"
good,Compensation need to be more competitive compare to other similar company. The caliber of managers need to be enhanced to have a very dedicated work force.
good,"Loved working at Intel.  Recent years had the company struggling to find its niche and overall position in the industry as it tried to catch up with all things Mobile (hardware and software).  It is attempting to lead the business regarding Internet of Things but seems to struggle where to actually play (from servers to sensors).  The company is plagued with millennials who may be the intelligent and most desired in today's age of relentless need for connectedness as the company takes a grip on these new hires lack of work ethic, advocacy, full enrollment, deep assimilation, loyalty as compared to previous generations like the one I belong who fully embraced the culture and stayed and believed in the company for decades.   Intel is lucky if they can keep new hires to last longer than 5 years, it seems."
good,Good interactions with design and cross functional teams. Management is good. People do work hard but friendly and provide with technical assistant when needed. Learned high speed designs.
good,I was pleased to work for Intel. I do not think that my experience was within the right group where I could flourish. Very bright individuals throughout the company. Job security is always a worry at Intel with the changing markets and technology.
good,The latest technology and many of the brightest brains make for an interesting place to work. Emphasis on individual contribution and not teamwork/collaboration makes for a pretty contentious environment. Corporate culture of disagree and commit is more disagree and do what you want.
good,"Pattern engineer:"
good,"To move up within Intel you have to overcome a great deal of corporate politics and you will have to fight to keep your work-life balance in check. Weekly late-night meetings are far from unusual. But the pay is very good and if you are willing to deal with the challenges this job brings, you can have security in it."
good,"Great company, in the way of compensation and benefits.   I initially enjoyed working here.   I started in manufacturing.   It however has changed in nature and I feel like i have hit a ceiling developmentally."
good,"I learned that we are hired to solve problems for the company. The bosses have their goals and direction well thought out where we must give our full support to achieve the goals set."
good,"A typical day starts at 9:00 am. "
good,Intel hires a hardworking and dedicated workforce which is the best part of working there. What learned there will certainly help me be successful in my next job.
good,"A good work place environment."
good,"Depending upon which group you report into, if you want to be challenged, Intel's the place to be. Some days will require long hours. In many ways, the manufacturing world continues to be like the 1970s."
good,"It really depends on the the team you work at. Some teams are extermely agressive and you learn a lot, others are opposite. I have seen both the side, but one this in common is that decisions are slow and the organisation is not fast at adopting to changes. Its a good places to learn stuff initially, but move out to more agressive organisation if career growth is your thing."
good,"The environment is really good and interesting, Intel Ireland is manufacturing the most advanced micro-processor in the world, really challenging. Co-workers are nice and willing to help."
good,"I always felt that Intel compensates very well, but they have a culture of layoffs, and while ostensibly operating as a meritocracy, I felt that skill and job performance may be overlooked for personal relationships. I felt that someone is always identified as the next ""fall guy"" for the next headcount reduction or performance review distribution. I was very happy to be in Intel employee for 15 years, but found the job much less satisfying once I became the ""sacrificial lamb"" in my department."
good,Aggressive production environment with constantly changing goals and technology requiring a high tolerance of ambiguity where meritocracy is the standard for promotion.
good,"I have a very high view on the older Intel, where people work together to solve problems and achieve challenging goals.  There was less concern with title and grade level than the Intel of today.  I feel fortunate to still work in that kind of environment, but I see many places where experienced folks are not treated respectfully and then management encourages churn to push people out.  What used to be accomplished by relatively junior people now takes senior grade level people to do."
good,Intel is a good company with good overall compensation.  For Engineering candidates specializing in silicon design it is a very good place to work.
good,Intel is a very interesting place to start a career. Some of my co-workers have move on to start business of their own. I like having to work hard to get ahead. I disagree with the ability of managers to stifle careers. Overall i enjoy this company
good,Intel is a great company to work for. They have a good life to work balance in which they make sure employees do not forget about their personal lives.
good,"Intel has many internal automation systems to promote efficiency when working as a process engineer. However, the on-call duty pager rotation makes for poor work life balance."
good,"New learning within university atmosphere under supervision of nano tech center in NY. Worked with state and federal funds, which made decision process a little challenging sometimes. learned new technical methodologies while pairing up with engineers from across the world."
good,Intel is a big company that had a reputation for making slow decisions.  They were trying to change this but the result is some very harmful decisions for Intel's long term future.  The decisions made at the top were not able to be checked for sanity when they made it all the way down to the bottom level.
good,Amazing history of technology and manufacturing scale nad today's management does a good job of honoring the companies great legacy. Unfortunately the company is a victim of its own success and has struggled to evolve and grow beyond its core products and business model.
good,"Intel is a decent place to work very state of the art, not so labor intensive, just a laid back place"
good,"Troubleshooting customer issues w/ hardware or software."
good,"I was at Intel for over 20 years. It is a great company and I wouldn't trade my time there as it helped form my career. "
good,"Existen días donde realmente aprendo sobre la administración de las empresas, ya que soy la asistente del dueño de dos empresas pero a veces me siento estancada porque no es un jefe que le guste que aprendan de él, es decir, enseñarle a sus subordinados todo el conocimiento que el tiene."
good,I worked as a production operator in many areas and liked all my jobs. I liked the challenges the company offered. The culture and management seemed to change a lot in the 10+ years I worked there.
good,Constantly changing demanding environment that kept you learning and developing your skill level.
good,The freedom given at work place is the pull in factor of Intel.
good,"Intel has been a great place to work, Intel is popular for it's flexible working hours and work culture. I could learn a lot of things in silicon domain. It's been an awesome experience working on next generation server processors"
good,"I've gained a lot from my experience at Intel. It is a fast paced company with much going on. There are plenty of diverse opportunities within the corporation should you be willing to move around. However, depending on location it can be very stagnant and difficult to move upwards on the career ladder. This is also a challenge because yearly ratings are given out on a curve. Should you not be willing to out-work your peers you will find yourself negatively perceived and reviewed. It adds to the competitive nature of the job."
good,Get to work on INTEL core business ideas and a great a place to learn new things
good,"A typical day at work would be to check mails,and check for any meeting if they are scheduled."
good,Good benefits with compressed schedules for engineers. Big company that sometimes sees employee as just a number.
good,"compressed ww 12 hr. days,"
good,"I loved the challenge, opportunities, global co-workers. There was a lot of variety to my multiple jobs. Before kids, I loved working at Intel and enjoyed coming to work (and the fact that it often followed me home). After kids, the total lack of work-life balance got to be overwhelming. A big part of me leaving is the fact that I had a manager that didn't understand my issue with working night/weekends all the time."
good,"At Intel they offer excellent compensation with good salary and great stock options. However, they don't care about their employees. An example is when they cut back, they simply cut people regardless of how long they have been there or how well they have done. The company is also very political, but I guess all companies tend to be that way."
good,"Can't beat the Bonus Structure at Intel, frequent payouts based on company revenue performance. A lot of reorgs, at least once a year on average"
good,"Nice Company to work with. "
good,"A stressful job in that you had to be always striving for next thing. "
good,"Probably an OK place to fade into the background and slowly do the expected."
good,"Your only issue may be your work-life balance. Its a lot of work may not be a great fit for individuals with family responsibilities, i.e. if you have to care for your kids too."
good,"It depends on the individuals to create an environment according to them in any situation."
good,"Not bad as a company if you're an intern "
good,Es una buena empresa para laborar si y sólo si es directamente con ella.
good,"A regular day would include quite a few meetings (either locally or globally) in early morning / through out the day and/or in the evening.  Coworkers were good and immediate management was good too.  Projects were challenging but interesting, schedule were always tight and demanding.  Work efficiency can be improved with simplified organization structure and design methodology.  Depends on the division, promotions can be very slow and sometimes biased."
good,"Frequent changes in direction for most-of/the-entire company made working at Intel like living in a blender."
good,"Good healthcare benefits"
good,"Work intensive, but lot of scope for personal development. Lots of challenging problems continuously happens at Intel which give lots of opportunity to learn and develop ones career. However, it is a very first paced, demanding and work intensive environment."
good,"Intel has been trying to venture into new market segments. However upper management doesn't seem to have the patience to wait for the outcome. Each time Intel spends millions of dollars to buy a new startup and then cancels it after few years. Same thing goes with products. In my previous team 3 projects in our department got cancelled in a year. It's a waste of resources and big tank on morale. "
good,"I lived the job that i did here but the management and training staff was very poor . i had so many different managers in such a short time it was hard to bond with them. there was favortism and retaliation anytime you would question actions that you knew were wrong.They weaponize your issues and use them against you."
good,"Intel is an excellent place to challenge yourself and grow.  The hardest thing about working at Intel is 100% owning your own career.   If done right, you will have the opportunity to be innovative and have your career grow."
good,"Intel is a great company. Unfortunately, the manager and team were a bad fit for me and I was over qualified for my job. I did love the fab and working on wafer and learning new things. I just hope to find a more challenging position."
good,"I was lucky in the fact that I was able to do my college graduation project for Intel as my “foot in the door” to a paid internship, becoming full employment upon graduation.  But for people directly applying for positions, external hires have to compete as “last ditch choices” as Intel tends to focus on allowing current employees first dibs on new job postings, followed by internal referrals to personal friends and family.  "
good,"coworkers are helpful and caring but managers mostly are either not experience or too political. The work itself is easy, it is just hard to get a job with the company due to the political and biased selections and recommendations."
good,"I was one of the workers. Enjoyed working on the Equipment. Received lots of training, and worked hard to keep the equipment running. I guess working nights 12 hour shift got old after 10 years. the differential was fair, but after awhile you cant afford to go to a day shift. I had 8 different supervisors in 10 years, So how are they suppose to Rate and Rank you when they haven't had any experience with you. My last Supervisor work days and I worked nights. Very lopsided. But I enjoyed my time at Intel and would go back if asked."
good,"Perks include lot of fun activities, GPTW programs and quarterly team events. Get to interact with lot of smart people and develop an overall picture."
good,"Not always the best, but a good place for a career. The work pace can be hectic and interrupt your work life balance. The company continues to grow and reduce headcount."
good,Working in IT at Intel is stressful.  Constant reorgs and threats of being laid off every year!  Intel is a good place to work if you are in one of the product units.  Avoid IT.
good,"Intel has some really smart talented people and great products, the only down side is that employees are forced to compete with each other and they hire and fire employees at the drop of a hat.  Expect to work hard and always be in a position to defend your worth, managment will change a lot and you will often need to reintroduce yourself and your work to new managment and a changing org enviornment."
good,"One of Intels values is Great Place to work. When looking at the things that matter, I agree with this value. The pay is fair, the benefits are great, the 401K and stock options are a nice to have as well."
good,Great Place to work if not in TMG. Management is not missing the AI train it seems and if you are on that Train good for you. If you plan to be involved in the traditional PC/Server look somewhere else.
good,I can't give an honest opinion about working at Intel. They discriminated against employees over 50 in the massive layoff and retirement packages they issues back in 2015.
good,"Intel was a great place to work years ago. However, they have changed over the years replacing seasoned employees with inexperienced workers on visas and/or in other countries. I was laid off due to Obama increasing the number of Visas for Intel. Intel then hiring many people on Visas to pay them way less and laying off us that had dedicated our life to Intel for 20 years and longer."
good,Intel semiconductor fabs are fast paced and challenging. The ability to move up is nonexistent unless you are in engineering or management. SPTD division is a poorly managed and a frustrating place to work. All the equipment is junk and there are leaks everywhere. 90% of the employees are engineers and the other 10% are the technicians that are running the factory and keeping things running and taking orders from the 90%.
good,Intel invents interesting things.  The technology is fun and challenging.  Lots of smart people to work with.  I enjoyed the team and learned a lot from engineers and lawyers alike.
good,After hours and weekend work expected with no renumeration and little thanks. Tired management who seek to meet metrics only with little regard for quality.
good,"Intel is in a constant state of flux. For a long time, you could expect redeployment (layoffs) to happen every four years or so. It is happening much more often now and sometimes we have multiple layoffs in the same year. Intel tends to over hire and then over fire. The theory is that you weed out the people who don't have the type A personality. Another theory is that you are good at your job, you have nothing to worry about. Both of these theories are flawed. "
good,"Amazing Company for Work Life Balance "
good,"difficult to advance in the company."
good,"No deseo evaluar a la empresa publicablmente. "
good,"Fast pass work environment, daily goals presented, great benefits, great people to work with. Some days better than others as far as head count verse work load. Best part of the job where the relationships formed through out the years top notch people."
good,Intel is not a steady place to work if you are looking for a life time career. Employment depends on the economical and political environment of the times.
good,"Lots to learn, challenging and competitive work environment. Management varies as it is a large company so experiences can be different. Sometimes it can get very stressful with work/life balance taking a big hit."
good,"* Normally conducted a tool box talks , post inspection and safety reporting all safety asfect "
good,"Challenging and Innovative workplace with all amenities every employee needs. "
good,"Intel has been a solid company to work for, but has been on a slow, gradual decline in job satisfaction over the past 10 years.  Technology is fast, paced and innovative.  Work is steady, and benefits are outstanding."
good,Traditional Company. Good work life balance. Allow employees to work from home and telecommute. Good health insurance options.
good,"There is always lots of work to do but it can get repetitive.  Typically we have ""passdown"" every morning in the fab which is how we learn about what happened the previous night and also to request maintenance technician resources.  Then we come out and have mid morning meetings and try to get real work done.  The hardest part of the job is not mental, but physical:  taking the on call pager.  Now management has hired night shift engineers, but these aren't available during ramping up of the new process, so we must have someone in our group on call 24/7.  Not getting enough sleep can make you sick and be quite stressful.  The most enjoyable part of the job is running experiments to test out new recipes and seeing them work."
good,Most IT managers are not suited for the roles as their people skills are well below their technical skills and lack proper training.
good,"Been with Intel a long time, there have been good times and not so good."
good,"1. Company's direction is clear."
good,"Good company but difficult to get things done as tons of layers of decision making and people fearful of getting things wrong."
good,"Good work-life balance culture encouraged by management. Employees are pretty well taken care of, both physically and emotionally. Flexible working hours and location is a big bonus."
good,"nice people around,"
good,"the usual corporate America soap opera scene - its not about what you know..."
good,This is a unique place to work. They have there own wiki page because they use so many different acronyms.
good,Highly competitive; great compensation; & mediocre human resource personnal
good,"Intel is a great place to work. There is no denying that. The people are talented, hard-working, and supportive and value personal growth along side business goals. "
good,Great flexibility when it comes to working hours and working from home
good,Intel is a disciplined workplace.
good,A good manager makes sure his people do not get burned out. He makes sure everyone is properly trained and cross trained so co-workers can help each other. Bad mangers will work you as much as possible without getting you proper training so you can do your job at all.
good,"great work environment, friendly coworker and manager. ready to learn daily, love to keep myself busy with daily, weekly, and monthly assignments."
good,"Productive and great work hours, They do take care of their people. They had a big layoff in april of 2016 where I was in. They wanted to become more of a datacenter business then chip maker."
good,had a great time but was placed on team that was never in office leaving me by myself. typical day was me working on my own in the teams cubicle. Probably should have requested to move teams as that was an option
good,A fornece um ambiente muito agradável para os seus funcionários.
good,Had to operate a fork lift to get orders down from the shelves.  Did lots of walking to the fab to deliver silicone wafers to the departments. Job was easy.
good,Nice work culture. Management is typically on point and very helpful. I enjoyed working closely with other Senior Developers and there were plenty of resources to get me up to speed.
good,A typical day could be very stressful and demanding along with a high volume of work. The learning curb is very strict with no room for error because loss time is revenue out the window and that is not acceptable with management.
good,Intel corporation is transitioning with a different set of job skill required for the next generation. Good opportunity  for local and  international travel.
good,Your going to work very hard not for the lazy people. Most individuals are type A personalities. The evaluate everyone against their peers. They are very much about the bottom line.
good,Tốt mội trường làm việc hiên đai chế đô tốt ó nhiệu hu nghĩ ngơi cho công nhân
good,"As an intern, I did not receive the normal Intel benefits. The work was frantic, but stable. Intel is a job place where you have to be part of a team, yet you have to be pro active in owning your learning."
good,Excellent atmosphere to work with.  Independence and career advancement is not an issue at Intel.  I enjoyed every minute of working there.  Good company to work for
good,"Good high tech industry, benefits are good"
good,"The experience will be different in each business group, but common themes include a well structured 'corporate value system', an emphasis on balanced worklife, and internationally dispersed work teams."
good,"Can be a great company to work for if you do not work in the fab. The hours are long and you get woken up and night and have to work weekends, wish they would employ night shift engineers"
good,"New CEO is slowly undoing all that made Intel a great place to work. Work/Life Balance declining. Culture moving back to the way it was in the early 90s, butt-in-seat, loss of flexibility. Losing innovative style."
good,"While a company with diverse projects and cutting edge innovation, internships are not as catered to. Mentorships are great, however the projects can be hit or miss depending on how large the project is (for example, there might not be enough work for the entirety of the internship)."
good,"I enjoyed working there.  After 16 years working hard to get ahead, I found myself leaving through no fault of my own.  If you like variety of tasks (change is constant) then this is the place for you.  Surviving there until retirement seems unrealistic to me."
good,A great working schedule.  The industry has a lot of ups and downs.  Lots of training offered.  Day to day operations rarely change.
good,"In charge of detective control for investments information of treasury department through coordination and confirmation with banks. Account monitoring activities for financial statements, detailed analysis of variations, accounts reconciliation for investments, balance sheet and cash, coordination with several departments in order to resolve the discrepancies in the accounts. "
good,"Tough to balance work/life.  Very demanding.  The culture is for everyone to work at night from laptops at home.  The compensation is good, though, and they have tried to get better with the balance and reward culture."
good,I really liked my job.  I worked there for 4 years.  The work schedule was good for me.  The compensation was great.  The work culture was also very competitive.  The bonus was good but the stress was also very intense at time.
good,"When I first started, Intel really valued 'a great place to work'.  By the time I left it was more like be thankful you have a place to work."
good,"The company treats you very well. I, however, was extremely bored considering I operated Naval Nuclear Reactors prior to this position. It is really difficult to advance without an advanced degree, so I chose to leave this company."
good,"Công việc ổn nhưng thu nhập không đủ trang trải cuộc sống nên tôi xin việc làm mới với hy vọng có mức lương cao hơn"
good,"Ottimi stipendi, benefit e bonus e soprattutto e' enormemente orientata alla meritocrazia"
good,"Fast paced work environment. Employees are rated and ranked and  if you are a bottom performer you will be forced to leave. High stress, highly competitive work environment"
good,"My job at Intel paid well.  However, the plant was closed and the work was sent to China."
good,"Intel was very generous with employees in the 90s.  Sadly, that changed after 2000.  While one record quarter after another was reported, we saw one cut-back after another."
good,"I learned the value of small things, getting alon with everyboy I workek with. A day at work was coming in getting my job done and going home"
good,"Intel in Folsom is a beautiful campus laid out to be very open and social. Employees are from a wide variety of departments like sales and marketing, production, engineering, and IT. Frequent campus and business group events provide plenty of opportunity to mix with others. "
good,"typical work day consisted of pass down between shifts,performing  scheduled preventative maintenance,responding to down equipment."
good,I learned a lot while working for Intel.  Great experience and wonderful opportunity.
good,Good work/life balance though projects and processes are way too long and should be me more agile.  the general the atmosphere is not so great but I guess it really depends on the team
good,"Planned job but very hectic schedule. "
good,"It was actually an excellent job environment, friendly and protected. I really like the 12 hrs shift. You will have to deal with people with type of work in life"
good,Providing safety working environment and fleixble hour for staff to done their task with freedom and less stress but abit pressure. friendly clicks and good HM
good,"If you want to have good work/life balance, Intel would be great fit for you. lots of good technologies and cash compensation is competitive. however stock price is showing no growth and is stuck below $40 for 17 years. so be mindful of that if you care about growth."
good,Great pay and vacation pay.  When company did good employees would get great cash bonuses.  Huge company so could transfer to  different department for a new start.   .
good,I don't have a fair opinion.  Intel acquired Altera and it has not been pleasant to say the least.  Trying to fit a square into a circle!  Each company do/did things very different and do them well on their own.
good,"Job was easy and exciting but management wasn't so great. Two time  I've worked for Intel, one at Octillo site and other at Chandler. Both were completely different jobs, one was production and the other wasn't. All jobs are pretty easy at Intel and a lot of walking."
good,"I am a contractor ."
good,When the company stops growing make sure you have a seat with the right group.  If not then you are open to being terminated regardless of accomplishments.
good,"Loved working there."
good,"Contract Worker 32 Training classes from working in cleanrooms to Arc Flash training. I learned alot about electrical distribution and critacal back up power, computer experiance, word, excell and ez power."
good,"I have worked at Intel for nearly 30 years as both employee and contractor.  Recently, after the 2nd round of layoffs in two years, I decided to quit because I found for me, the job environment had become very hostile due to manpower shortages.  In just the past 5 years, I had over 20 managers!  When I contacted HR over some shift issues, they didn't even bother to respond.  Loved it while I was there, but glad I am gone.  BTW, HR is now ""virtual"" instead of having a real HR department you can go and talk to in person."
good,"CEO and HR VP are locked in on shedding good people.  They have lost the realization that it's all of the employees, not just the top rock stars, who make this company work. "
good,"Device drivers"
good,"Good compensation for the work, and at times the job can be rewarding. Little to no advancement in the manufacturing department. Very ambiguous work environment, which can be good and bad."
good,"Intel has gotten very bureaucratic in the 20 years with which I was associated. Worthless work can be hidden in silos, permitting bad management to retire in place."
good,"There is a lot of things to learn and pick up on. The company was not willing to train new hires due to contract and just a temporary position. I did acquire additional training and knowledge with T-type thermocouples, wind tunnels, thermal chambers, acoustic chambers, and lab view. I was not given the opportunity to perform any test request due to lack of work and in house preferential treatment. I was not comfortable with management since I was not being trained or valued as an employee."
good,"Managers have their ""favorites"" and will promote those people.  Organization has great people, but the younger interns and members of family are typically chosen first,  Also, work share is completely unbalanced between team members."
good,this survey is taking too long and is annoying.  i'm done with this survey and it is annoying.  i'm just typing now in order to meet the requirements of the survey.
good,"Uno de los puntos más en contra ha sido la intermediación entre las ETT, lo cual me costó mi puesto de trabajo por causas TOTALMENTE DESCONOCIDAS y sin explicaciones algunas, dando absolutas largas a la responsabilidad de la decisión tomada."
good,"The best part about working at Intel was the opportunity to learn from smart colleagues.  Sharing was encouraged, and my lead was fantastic--hands off, but always available with a pearl of crucial insight."
good,Intel is a great place to work as long as you are not a contract employee. Contract employees are not treated well; even if you provide above average work.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to engage with the community and employees; flexible days that aren't typical, work culture can be a challenge for women, and people of color as is in most tech companies. Overall, not a bad place to work"
good,Intel is definitely a good place to work. It has a lot of scope for an individual's development both in terms of Personal and professional. Lot of learning indeed.
good,Good place to work with good people. Management in in a state of flux right now.  Many good employee is leaving.  Pay is good but there is no work life balance.
good,"Extremely busy non-stop position where there is never a dull moment.  Good mix of people.  Salary is very challenging.  Work conditions are very pleasant.  Calm, controlled atmosphere."
good,Expect to work across geographies with some travel.  Yearly Ranking and Rating (performance review) is poor and demoralizing.  Make sure to move around the company.
good,Naturapathic clinic that uncludes massage therapy is always fun to work and do you job.
good,Intel shares many of the flaws of Microsoft. Read the Vanity Fair article about Microsoft's lost decade and the story of Intel is very similar.
good,"It’s fine working for Intel in my industry. But, I am often forgotten or neglected by management with unrealistic timelines. Also the pay compensation is not nearly enough for the amount of work I do."
good,"Good for starting your Career. "
good,"Downside is new office politics are your job is eliminated, then you can then apply for that same job or another.  All upper management decisions are a secret, breeding no trust, and focal (raise/promotion) process also a black box and a constant disappointment.."
good,"As a UX practitioner, Intel is a challenging environment to contribute your expertise.  Many understand the importance of user centered design, but are not so experienced in how to implement it, especially in an agile development environment.  There are also many perks to working for such a large company."
good,Môi trường làm việc lành mạnh.có cơ hội phát triển tốt.
good,Great place to work but Intel IT is not under good management.Lot's of lay off going through so Can't relay on management.But have good work life balance.
good,"Poor work life balance on call even during vacations."
good,"I was working as a programmer, and I left because it was not working out. They wanted stuff done fast, but when I finished it, they would change the requirements. Then, they would complain that I was not getting my work done on time too. I think I just had a bad manager, and maybe the rest of Intel is just fine, i don't know. Also, I was getting in trouble for using the restroom too much."
good,"Nhìn chung mặt bằng làm việc ổn nhưng cách làm việc lại không làm cho nhân viên làm lâu năm muốn gắn bó lâu dài, chính sách đãi ngộ dành cho nhân viên lâu năm gần như ko có nên vòng đời nhân viên ở đây thường chỉ tầm 5 đến 7 năm là họ sẽ ra đi"
good,They pay on a national scale so it is good in lower cost areas.  They do not care about engineers and treat them as pieces of capital equipment.  Projects and areas of assignment are available only when you are finishing your current assignment.
good,The base salary is really really low but it will help the employee to stay more due to their stocks option (RSU) but the company keep on changing thus not much of a job security.
good,Good place to work if you can stand for long periods of time good to employees clean and respectful Environment. People were nice.
good,"With the increasing complexity of manufacturing, you would think that a company would increase staffing, instead you are just expected to worked harder and faster without mistakes."
good,Intel is a busy place to work.  You work within a team cell and most days time flies quickly.  Good location with plenty of amenities.
good,"Most of the reason why you'll like or hate Intel has a lot to do with who your manager is. They can make you on a great career path, or you can be left to the wolves. Intel lays off a lot of people each year in the annual review process. ""They hire the best"" but they also layoff a certain percentage (target) in the annual review. Its not terribly hard to beat the odds and not be the one let go. However you have to play the game, and not be the one that gets picked for sacrifice. Since they did away with the pension benefit several years ago and reduce the profit sharing percentage the compensation has gone down a little bit."
good,"There are many pro's and con's about working at Intel."
good,"I overheard an engineer once who described the techs as ""robots with faulty programming."" There were time when working at Intel was one of the best jobs in the world."
good,"Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company. Wide variety of challenges.  Complex corporate structure."
good,"I enjoyed working as a teller with the credit union as I had various duties to perform and met many people.  Learned balancing general ledger, balancing vault, and teller drawer.  I enjoyed working the remote location site whenever necessary."
good,"Hired on through a third party to work out of Best Buy. Worked out of the laptop section (no commission), mainly just informing customers about Intel products. Talked a lot with every customer.  No benefits."
good,"There was a lot of favoritism in which other employees were very upset. It was very productive at times, but certain things weren't going by the book."
good,work experience is good but need a change why because here in intel I can improve much technical. we are using all automation tools here in intel.
good,"I survived Intel for 7 years. It was an amazing place full of development opportunities, very open and democratic culture. If you are highly motivated, can argue, stand up for yourself, write well you will do well. Negatives are that the pressure can be artificially high and fear and paranoia abound."
good,"Great place to build a career, if you can stand some of the people and the job. Great benefits and hours."
good,"Good place to work,just need to walk far from parking lot to production,also far cafetaria,not enough benefit,low basic and given basic salary is not by experience"
good,"If you're interested in getting your foot in the door and maintaining your skills, this is the position for you. They have a decent work staff and management is fairly understanding."
good,Long work days in clean room gear. Work load is heavy but not overwhelming. Compressed work week helps with recovering form the long hours. Breaks are short considering how far away the break rooms are form the factory floor.
good,"Day to day work is very detail driven as would be expected. This is not suited to everyone."
good,they have the open door policy;  anybody from the management sits in the same cubicle as you;  no micromanagement;  you can be productive and work anywhere in campus
good,"They will work you as hard as you let them, and it's better for them if you are willing to travel.  When I left, there was no premium for health insurance (with a high deductible plan) or vision, so you only paid for dental.  You also had the option of a paid sabbatical every 7 years or a paid (just under) half sabbatical every 4.  Annual bonus, 401K lump sum contribution, quarterly bonus, free fruit, free soft drinks & coffee, lots of unpaid overtime with no more reward for the OT than not doing it."
good,"unfortunately it's just a job as career growth is limited. if thy like you doing what you are doing; you'll get stuck doing that forever"
good,"I enjoyed the diversity in the workplace. There was never a dull moment. However, I see people work their head off, but doesn't get the recognition they deserve from management. Project based layoffs were always on people's minds."
good,slow workplace during the summer hours; management was away a lot on vacation as is their right but made work for an intern hard to accomplish and feel proud of
good,"If management is good things will be peaceful to work for."
good,"Good company where you can advance. Very long hours and demanding, can burn you out if you let it. Challenging technology and culture. Safety is very important."
good,Intel has changed in the last few years. They no longer invest in end user influence. This has a large impact on intel's culture and budgeting process.
good,"Pleasant  work environment, nice sharp employees from all over the world, nice to see some diversity in OR. Everything is running by scheduled meeting, no add-hook collaboration."
good,"The products we worked on where difficult, challenging, and as a result, enjoyable and rewarding.  "
good,"I'd recommend Intel to anyone simply because it looks great on your resume when you apply to other companies. Otherwise, it is a pretty cut-throat company to work for and you better plan to be working when you are off the clock because your phone will ring day or night with co-workers who want answers."
good,I spent 14 years at Intel. It was a great company but very stressful to work at and once you get high enough on the food chain it becomes impossible to take a day off. Compensation is very good but you will not have a life outside of work
good,It didn't work well for me when I moved to Intel Folsom....
good,"Intel has always been a great company, and is doing great things. But increasingly it's more about operating margins and getting more done with less than investing in people and their careers."
good,"Mal feedback al momento de la revisión de informes, poca capacitación"
good,"On the development side of Intel, it is a very competitive environment. Sometimes that competitive side makes it difficult to enjoy and excel. "
good,"If you are on a process engineering job in a factory, know life-work balance can be non-existing depending on the group you are with, but the group you end up working with is not necessarily the same one you interviewed with, so very hard to tell how it will be before getting there"
good,"As an engineer, you are given a lot of freedom, your work performance is based on what you do, how much you do, and how it compares to your peers. If you want to make the most money, keep looking, but if you want work/life balance with okay compensation and top benefits, work at Intel."
good,"Very stressful and under appreciated in some jobs, in the 24 years I worked there, seen many changes. The employees tend to make the job much more enjoyable."
good,"Even though my time there was thru a contracting company, my experience with with the Intel employee was a good one and they seem satisfied with their job."
good,"A typical day in my group is meetings, , emails and coaching. "
good,"Intel was a manufacturing company of electronics boards and parts. In the first three years I was a Surface Mount machine operator. I was involved in all aspects and phases of the boards production, testing and shipping. Later on I was in charge of the Spare Parts area. That  particular area gave support to mechanics and engineers ensuring the availability of all parts , equipment and service needed to the production lines. We were driven by customer satisfaction and high quality products. Learned how critical is to follow the proper rules and regulations .  "
good,"Times were good at first. They had a mass hiring for all of us and we were part of a great company, so we thought. After working there 10 years I was part of a mass layoff. The people they kept were the people who worked there before the mass hiring 10 years earlier. Strange. I did get a severance check. I loved working there."
good,Very busy job and rewarding! I typically had so much work I never took a break during the day and worked some weekends to keep up with the workload. My co-workers were great and we all worked as a team to help each other.
good,"Intel has become a political machine. if you don't know someone of power,, than your job is always on the line."
good,"Management is risk averse and decision making is slow. "
good,"Intel was a fantastic place to work - solid benefits, quirky engineering attitude and basis for all decision making.    Intel has been good to me personally and professionally.   I sincerely have enjoyed my Intel journey."
good,"Great place to work. Great Cafeteria."
good,"Early morning conduct check point meetings with Europe. Drive into work to meet with project stakeholders here in U.S.A. along with management update meetings. Late afternoon follow up on emails, prepare for any up coming deadlines or presentations. Early evening check in with Asian countries on project progress."
good,"Great co-workers. The hardest part of the job is the work life balance, even when I am off I am still responsible for my tools."
good,"I loved my job in the research and development lab. the people I worked with were great people was on my way to be hired and have a great future with intel. But Phyllis retired and Jay didn't know how important I was and didn't renew my contract. How sad because I will probably never go back because of that, the missed communications between management and employees is huge. Its sad that because of their lack of communication skills that I don't work there anymore and probably never will again."
good,"Responsible for manufacturing sustaining, defect reduction, process characterization, and equipment/process improvements to support factory goals"
good,"It has been interested to my career and personal life there, and a lifetime landmark for me."
good,"As long as they have a business need of you, everything is wonderful. However, if your job is deemed end of life, it is almost impossible to get a transfer. No regard for years of experience or what you have accomplished, you start out as day one against anyone coming in from outside...and that just isn't right!"
good,"I enjoy my job even working a mandatory 48 hours a week. I really like my manager and I think he really does support the team.  "
good,"Intel is one of the leaders in the High Tech Industry."
good,"Good Learning experience. Simulations, Debug."
good,Great company overall...just lost it's direction lately.
good,"As a CAD engineer, i get to learn a lot about how to setup systems that enable verification and help designers in the process of simulating circuit behaviour. I have learned a lot on how to interact with different people and understood the manner in which they work towards the acccomplishment of day-to-day tasks. I have had the opportunity to attend technical seminars and understand a lot about the way Intel goes about designing devices for everyday use. My co-workers are very co-operative and helpful. "
good,"Long working hours are typical"
good,Management was very appreciative of a good work effort. The casual atmosphere was one of the best I have worked in.
good,"Fast-paced environment, very intelligent employees. Great benefits. Many different job opportunities"
good,"You will have to use your brain here....slacking here and you will be fired. Pay attention to detail, hours seem like days at times....But it's a job....while on break look for another job. EVERYONE Does..."
good,An environment of fast pace technology and cutting-edge software. Best start to a career as you get a dose of operational excellence and product management.
good,"Neue 4G Features entwickeln, was sehr kreativ war."
good,"Your group and management can make you or break you. Interview carefully and choose wisely."
good,"NA, during this time I was a contractor. Our management team could improve on contractor relationships or at least learn about problem resolution management & not be so quick to put blame on an individual versus perhaps a flawed process or communication oversight."
good,"Flexible working hours with very good work life balance . "
good,Face pace work environment. Must be highly motivated to meet expectations of job scope across all departments. Great benefit package. Work/life balance not always in favor of life balance.
good,"Just like many corporate America jobs, Intel has its pros and cons. There is a lot of bureaucracy. The talent that is hiring is overall average with a high standard deviation."
good,"Intel is a great place to work.  Team is a high performing team, and many opportunities for us to succeed and make an impact to the bottom line.  Unfortunately, Intel is choosing to close the Intel site in Utah, and so will be encouraging existing team members to relocate with assistance from Intel.  Disappointing that they made that decision and are choosing to 'break up the band' of high performing individuals."
good,aprendi a trabajar en los cuartos donde hacen los chips de las computadoras y era necesario usar un traje especial
good,"Good teamwork, Fast Support, Be pro active, Enjoy with work environment, Good attitude among each others, learning new technology, good benefits & fast learn"
good,"As a contract employee, you show up, do what work needs to be done.  This group treated me almost as an equal, included me in meetings, making decisions, etc."
good,Very smart people who will challenge you to be better. The culture can be stuffy and a good work life balance is difficult to maneuver but the opportunity to learn is solid. World class manufacturing.
good,"Lots of autonomy to get the job done.  However, lots of red tape, which restricts the ability to get things done. Overall a good place to work.  People care about their work."
good,"Pros:"
good,I always worked on my own. I was flexible time as long as I had to complete my work done in schedule. I collected data and work status to report to my manager everyday.
good,It was a great experience. I was able to learn cutting edge technology and tools. The job environment was very professional. The pay was decent as well.
good,"Solutions architects were a great way to get your foot in the door in the industry, however it was very limited as far as day to day and advancement."
good,"Good compensation , flex schedule, stressful work environment. Limited chances for advancement or department change. Very competitive working environment."
good,"I started at Intel working for Siemens, then CompuCom. I worked at Intel but my Company was contracted by Intel. I really liked working at Intel because the environment was very professional and friendly."
good,"Intel provides paid sabbatical for a month every 4 years. Encourages team work. Provides free subscription to degreed, lynda etc.. Has an option to do DOT projects if your manager allows."
good,A lot of really great and talented people to work with.  Management was clear and helpful and able to give good opportunities.  Exciting technology to work on.  Nice facilities in a great location.
good,"Great place to work and learn. Very disciplined in the workplace. Structured but with roonm to wriggle."
good,We were able to do a lot of things at Intel. It was a very fun experience that we had as interns. They taught us a lot about being an employee at Intel.
good,"I liked the fact that I got to work with hardware testing on this project like KBL and SKL, creating virtual switches, hyper - v manager, created and executing test cases."
good,"A regular day would include quite a few meetings (either locally or globally) in early morning / through out the day and/or in the evening. Coworkers were good and immediate management was good too. Projects were challenging but interesting, schedule were always tight and demanding."
good,"Life and work balance, care about individuals, good place"
good,"as a contactor, not knowing when a project would end was unnerving.everone from management and staff never knew if they were going to be let go there was no job security. it was everyone for himself and management couldnt help. their hands were tied. the intel board was making decisions that was impossible for management and for management to control."
good,Fast paced with a lot of opportunity to drive results. Access to work on cutting edge technology and things on the fore front of technology. Fun filled too
good,"All around good company to work for. Provided employees with a solid career path via the ability to be cross-functional. "
good,solid framework to be followed throughout the day. structured meetings and organized training..........................................................
good,Hours could be long. I worked 60ish and was the low man in the group. Not much resource dedicated to training. Work life balance was difficult but I'm sure some groups were better than others.
good,"My last program was great, taught me a lot and allowed me to grow significantly.  2 others had poor management each were disbanded.  Management is key"
good,Good comp + benefits.  Diverse workplace.  Good work/life balance (after a few years).  Challenging work in a fast-paced industry.  Good relationship with front-line manager.
good,"- flexible working schedule and friendly people"
good,I am pretty neutral with the work environment. It is neither good or bad it is pretty much right in the middle. Just really wish I could put my education to work with the company.
good,Typical workplace. I worked as contractor and nothing much to say about bonus and other benefits. Work culture is good and they treated people very well.
good,"Management can be less than flexible. Pay is not great and advancement is highly political. Often times you feel unappreciated. Because of how you are rated and ranked, there's a lot of backstabbing in order to secure your 'satisfactory' review."
good,"Intel is one of many Fortune 500 companies that provides or encourages a GPTW (Great Place To Work) environment. Each quarter, each team member of an org is entitled to spend $25 towards an event to build Team/Org camaraderie, enhance team energy/spirit and/or have fun together as a team. They encourage folks to participate outside or on campus in an activity that fosters team building and to get them to collaborate more together. This is very beneficial especially if the org is new and/or as a result of restructuring due to head count reduction."
good,"Great place to work ! collaborative workspace. As an intern I learnt  a lot, but  as an intern I did not receive much work allocated to me. But over all it is good place to be !"
good,"Interesting and diverse place to work, management and atmosphere is supportive of career development, good balance of work and family life. The environment is a healthy mix of peak work load and time for interaction with colleagues and personal development."
good,"Stressful, although they promote life/work balance, unable to attain based on projects and deadline."
good,It was a place to work. Most people were all right. If you're a contractor you don't get much in the way of perks or respect. My working conditions were just fine with little interference.
good,"Typical day at work: Not stressful"
good,Intel Corporation provides many supportive and responsive actions in several areas of the company. There is lots of internal assistance available on the company's Intranet.
good,I was in the test lab doing 12hrs shifts. It was not stressful as long as you are knowledgeable of how the equipment works and are responsible. Relaxed environment.
good,"This is a great company to work for.  Great pay, great benefits, and lots of opportunities for job growth.  You get to work with a lot of smart hard working people."
good,"Intel is an amazing place to work - just be mindful that they are continually going through reorganizations. Finding a good manager is paramount. Remember that most people will leave their manager, not their job - very true at Intel."
good,"Intel is such a large company with dozens of different product lines.  My experience as an intern could hardly cover the company as a whole.  What I experienced was a very large amount of freedom to explore my own problem-solving methods.  I had ownership of the tasks and systems I worked on, and people depended on me and trusted me to be an expert in my little corner of the company.  I worked with a small team of 8-10 people, and hiring decisions were up to the team leader.  I had frequent opportunities (but infrequent compelling reasons) to work with people outside my team, so my time there felt more like working for a small independent company."
good,"I really enjoyed my time with Intel. I spent a good deal of time interfacing with other employees, who were very supportive during my placement. I recommend the company highly."
good,"One of their values and often quite true."
good,Overall Intel's Medical Benefits are great. Keep learning in order to growth. It's a great place to work such as giving free drinks and lunch subsidy.
good,"My overall experience at Intel was good. It was very fast paced, and I was never, ever bored there.  As a contractor, I was given many opportunities to showcase my skills."
good,"Good company overall. The compensation at the tech level is not adequate for the workload. Focal reviews were unfair and disappointing, which leads to no incentive to work hard. In fact, overachieving is frowned upon because if you do not beat previous years achievements, then you will not last. I overachieved, and got an average focal....lose lose situation."
good,If you are hard working and you like to experience new challenges and new skills Intel is right place for you. They have diversity and smart people. Also free snack.
good,Able to tackle new projects and learn new technologies very often. Collaborative work environment. Management is inept at times and not great at communicating.
good,"At Intel, I was able to work in the Human Resources Department and figure out what type of work I wanted to do in the future. It was a good way to get into the job world as a high school student."
good,"If you tend to work more than 8 hrs a day at your job, then Intel might be a good fit for you as most employees work beyond the typical 8 hrs a day. If you don't like working after you get home for a few hours and more than a few hours on the weekend, then don't work here because all your coworkers will out pace you and you'll look like the lazy one. There's a strong corporate culture here geared towards many things I admire, such as striving to continually improve and innovate, not resting on one's laurels just because something is going well (let's *keep* innovating in other words) and to be willing to take risks and work hard to achieve new things. I enjoyed many things about my time here, but overall, it was intense to work with so many workaholics. All that being said, I left the company several years ago and perhaps the culture has softened, but I don't think it has."
good,"Working compressed work week has advantages, but can be hard on a new family. You will learn to work with people from different cultures which I have found rewarding."
good,"Coordinar las capacitaciones con las tiendas."
good,always a procedure for everything with everything 'copy exact'  Meetings are a source of information passing and there is a strong sense of cut-throat around the working environment
good,"A good place to work when starting your career, a lot of mundane work. Teams are spread across US and India making it difficult to co ordinate. Have to stay up at night attending meetings"
good,"Surrounded by smart, motivated people. Working on leading edge technology with a free licence to innovate. Excellent pay and benefits. Could benefit from better work-life balance."
good,"Intel is a company driven to succeed.  As such, employees work hard.  Intel provides great benefits and pays well.  Definitely need a degree to get into the door. Intel provides many opportunities for diversity and inclusion - even though it is difficult to enjoy these benefits due to the drive to get product out the door.  Intel is a large company - as such, management is as diverse as the individual manager's personality."
good,"Maybe it's because I started prior to the Pentium birth I don't know, Intel is missing laughing in the corridors -  i found at the end of my time ... there just wasn't enough friendly and its a necessity for some of us out there"
good,"- Helping team with very knowledgeable but friendly manager makes your work at the company exciting and motivational."
good,There is plenty said about Intel and I don't have interest right now in adding to that volume of content. I will continue here until I meet the requir
good,"Overall good place to work. Shift work is not conducive to work life balance. Good benefits. Very diverse workforce. At time they take things way too seriously which causes unneeded stress.  Upper management doesn't listen to its people. Plenty of avenues for suggestions, but they get overlooked."
good,Some days were very long depending on the time of year. I worked in Intel's Great Place to Work program. Planning and executing the events for our campus could be extremely rewarding and seeing the happy employees and their families  made it worth the long hours. My manager was very difficult to work with and we not always acknowledge our teams skills which made work more difficult.
good,"Large enterprise company with great internal systems and procedures and that makes it easy to get lost in the fray. The Focal system is discouraging, Established Methodologies - implementing change can be difficult. Cultural discrimination is been seen at the time I was working with the company."
good,"Good amenities"
good,"Though I had a very short stint in Intel, I felt it is an organization with extremely open environment and open culture though abided by the process and rules of the system. People with passion are highly encouraged."
good,Fun place to work with exiting opportunities to grow and explore. Work culture is very healthy and friendly. Opportunities for learning many new technologies.
good,"Everyone I worked with was great, but the overall feeling is that the ship is heading in the wrong direction and can't be turned around quickly enough to avoid a crash."
good,Don't have anything to say - unfortunately site is forcing me to enter something here.  It was over 15 years since I worked at Intel and I do not think it would be fair/relevant to do a review of this company
good,"High caliber employees: highly professional, dedicated, and talented"
good,"Intel is great place to work. At times the workload can be demanding, but there are a lot of opportunities to learn and interface with management. Great place to start for corporate finance."
good,"When I started people talked about the ""good old days"" when the company was good to it's people and compensated them well for the occasionally excessive time and effort they put in.   When i started I thought it was just selective memory of the good times. "
good,"Busy, challenging, stressful, time management needed, factory environment, on call, great place to work, Portland weather unpredictable, work life balance"
good,"The company is changing fast. Revenues from PC sales as been mostly flat so Intel is repositioning itself as a data center and an IoT company. Along this process, there a lots of cultural changes that are needed to succeed. It's not easy but the company is trying hard."
good,I enjoyed working at Intel.  Work/Life balance was reasonable.  Compensation and benefits were very good. Job Security and Advancements opportunities were available.  Management and culture were positive.
good,"Good place to work. Nice work life balance. One could learn a lot. Projects get closed more frequently than not. Feeling of in-stability was there, no matter how you perform."
good,"I moved out to the Folsom location for a Co-op rotation.  The work was excellent and fulfilling, and the benefits just made the work even easier.  I really enjoyed the Folsom location because of proximity to San Francisco and Lake Tahoe."
good,"Productive and fun place,"
good,A great place to work where they value the skill and personal being of the employees.Improving the people welfare and helping them to learn more things.
good,"It's good supportive environment, debug in the process and new challenges every day. "
good,Intel was a good place to work.  I was fortunate to also have a great team of employees in my group.  The company gave both profit sharing and bonuses and offered stock purchase discounts.
good,"I enjoyed my time a Intel.  Sometimes it is hard to be heard.  It is very cliquish and that doesn't always result in the best decisions. Very competitive company.  "
good,"As an equal opportunity employer, I like  working at Intel that provides good professional environment with sufficient work life balance."
good,"Great place to work, good learning, awesome people to work with"
good,It is fun to work on cutting edge technologies with some of the brightest people in the world. Teams are quite diverse and you have to be on your toes if you want to climb ladders at Intel.
good,"worked in lab for testing for many years. Very fun worked with teammate, but most times are flagging for tool and software."
good,I was a RCG hired by Intel Corp 13 years ago. It is a great company to work for. Intel university has very good online classed to train you be a satisfactory.
good,"Working here was excellent.  Every day was busy, meetings all start on time, management sets appropriate expectations, and work-life balance was better than I thought it would be."
good,"Learned a great deal of skills, Has a lot of benefits and lots of fun outings for intel employees. Needs work with understanding employee needs. Mentorship is lacking"
good,"Intel used to be a bureaucratic company, but it has come a long way in the last couple of years in my department. Benefits have also improved, although still below market in the silicon valley area."
good,"Intel is a great place to work. Everything here is organized and there is openness with the management."
good,Could be an amazing place to work and heard great stories of what it used to be... A complete culture shock and very demoralizing..
good,The work environment at Intel is very demanding.  Be prepared to give 110% effort minimum every day.  My co-workers were great people.
good,"Environnement de travail pas mal, des chose son bien , des chose son pas bien"
good,Arrive at work: Friendly chat with manager. Begin workday. Good working relationship with manager and co-workers. Team oriented environment. Lunch with co-workers and sometimes management. Finish work and start over again next day.
good,You have them tell you what they need and you have to produce product period its very hard to extremely hard  very enjoyable tho be a tester not a programmer. I would maybe come back
good,"interact with internal training deveopment, manage trackign systems, cerate training manual/job aids, ensure inter-departmental communication, porcess standardization/improvement, meet and reprt out on key objective status, general office correspondence,"
good,intel là một công ty lớn có chế làm việc hợp lý. giúp người có thể khẳng định năng lực của bản thân qua từng vị trí làm việc.
good,"Very fast paced and high stress depending on your work group.  Your growth and development is highly dependent on your manager regardless of your efforts.  The culture tends to create an ""every man for himself"" environment.  "
good,"Intel is a great company to work for. It's a vibrant place with plenty of opportunities to grow and challenge yourself. Intel employees are smart, hard workers, and team players."
good,"Loved working in the labs at Intel when they were well funded and the work we did could impact the entire computer industry.  When Paul Otellini took over as CEO, the R&D budgets dried up and their was less emphasis place on innovation."
good,"Lots of opportunities to develop a career, and also travel to other sites in what is a global company. Good pay and benefits packages."
good,"Work in Intel have a big risk."
good,"One of the great  place to work and good work life balance. Need to be focused on your long term career objective - otherwise, it would be easy to drift away.."
good,"Good place to work, but when you get over 40 they try to push you out.  I was there for 14 years.  Not a leader.  The management is set in their ways."
good,Many great people serious about moving technology forward. Lots of responsibility given to individuals. Stress level is in the mid range. Good opportunities available if you seek them out.
good,The best part of this job was working with new technologies and working with a great group of people as we called on an important retailer.
good,"Intel Corporation (better known as Intel, stylized as intel) is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Santa Clara, California. Intel is one of the world's largest and highest valued semiconductor chip makers, based on revenue."
good,Very pleasant place. I love working for Intel. Learnt a lot about EE. Management and reviews are standardised. Perks are good.
good,"Great benefits with opportunities to cross train in may areas. Pride in working on cutting edge technologies. "
good,"Intel has an amazing collection of talented, really smart people who make world-class products. However, people don't collaborate well, and this aspect isn't valued come review time. It's all about your brag-sheet and what you did. There are some who do value collaboration and working with others to get something bigger accomplished, but they're not managers/execs, who tend to be more of the me-first model (which is probably how they became execs)."
good,"Intel does all that it can to retain employees and provide a good work-life balance, and this level of effort is visible throughout the organization. As an employee you feel valued and secure in your position. However, Intel is facing some real competitive pressures right now and as exhibited by recent layoffs is trying to find a way to restructure into a technology leader (rather than just a semiconductor leader). Only qualm of working here was that the work was very silo-ed and thus made it challenging to take the initiative and expand one's daily responsibilities. Still, a great place to start and develop a career."
good,"Intel is a good organization to star after school in my experience. I was able to improve many of my skill and learn new ones, change career goals. "
good,"Intel was an excellent first job that really got me a feel for just about everything that goes on when making a chip, leading it through design in the fab all the way too finished products. Everyday was a challenge and it required 120% to be able to get your work done and retain all the information. The management I had was excellent, but work was always overwhelming. Probably the hardest part of the job was the time it took to get turn around time on issues. They usually required many reviews and meetings. The best part of the job were the people I worked with, they were very positive and I learned a lot from them."

good,"For me this is very good experience and yeah its really great place to work,So many new things I learned from Intel and my team members.bb"
good,A great place to work and learn. Work environment is clean & tidy.One feels at home among co-workers. Hardest part is the night shift on certain projects which is un-healthy after certain age.
good,I was able to learn processes of manufacturing and I was able to build on the critical skills that is needed in the job market. I was able to connect with other personnel and ensure that tools were up to specification with industry standards. Overall I really enjoyed the job.
good,Solid company to work for and grow your career. Would recommend the company to anyone who like growth and opportunity. Can be a stressful place to work during ramps.
good,Intel is a semiconductor technology leader and currently foraying into new technologies. The work culture is relaxed while being dedicated to deliver consumer friendly compute infrastructure. A good place to explore some of the leading semiconductor design and fabrication technologies.

good,"Typical day at work is resolving the quality issues."
good,"it is a very challenging and rewarding environment to work in, great leadership team that provides vision to the future of the company"
good,"I have been working at intel full-time (more than 3 year)"
good,"I worked at Intel for eight years. The chances for advancement were great and in my time working there, I moved through three departments, learning more as I went along. I would work there again."
good,Constant pressure to do more with less. Panic mode PC sales not good. Missed mobile market. Current CEO is a loose canon.
good,"Great company with great benefits.  Management is a bit sketchy, but it is what it is.  Micromanaging runs rampant here.  Overall, again, great company to work for."
good,"Great place to work specially the wireless group. They are working on advanced cellular technologies e.g. LTE-A (Carrier Aggregation, etc.) and it is very exciting to be at the forefront of technology."
good,"I have been with Intel not very long. So this review will reflect that. "
good,Highly bureaucratic but rewarding work. Constantly reinventing itself to catch up in mobile and what's ahead in technology
good,"Great team environment with great benefits.  Daily activities include focusing on customer experience and supporting Sales Staff deals to completion.  Learned supply chain management, conflict resolution and the power to change anything."
good,"It is a very diverse company, with many ares for employees to grow professionally. Big challenges due the size and complexity of the products, but rewarding when you see them on the streets."
good,"Very nice place to work. The support was great, you could have online meetings to get help. There were software support meetings so you could learn the tools better."
good,"Worked at Intel for 10 years.  There were a lot of benefits to working there - various perks, good pay, good people.  Downsides were that it was a lot of work, career advancement was difficult at times, and the bureacracy was overwhelming at times."
good,"A typical day starts with "
good,"bon accueil, bonne intégration, bonne collaboration avec les collègues."
good,"A typical work day starts with a Agile standup meeting to understand the progress being made on the task delivery."
good,This is a company that you will always do more that what you were hired to do. It offers great versatility should you want to proceeded other career paths.
good,Intel is a great company to work for and can offer the employees so many great things. There is room for growth and unlimited opportunities within the company if you are looking to explore other career opportunities.
good,"Challenging and place with unlimited possibility."
good,Lots of paperwork to keep you safe and aware of what task is at hand.
good,Same things that happen at your typical computer software and hardware company. Ive learned alot about how updating and test running firmware systems on previous components and existing OS and see if they are compatible. My co-workers were great ive learned a lot from them and made feel welcome. the hardest part of the job is that there are multiple times where a you will be piled with a lot of projects to do and have to complete them a short time period and one testing can last a whole work day or even more and you still have to do the other tests after that. the enjoyable part is that you were able to get hands on experience with new components.
good,A terrific career path with excellent benefits and work/life balance.
good,There are always new challenges to solve. Provides detailed knowledge of outstanding new technology and manufacturing processes. management style allows independent thinking to creative innovative new solutions. Great group of very sharp people to work with that know how to work together to get results. I enjoyed leading a team of technically skilled individuals and providing the vision to direct their efforts. It's sometimes difficult to turn off work and relax on vacations as there is always the urge to check emails since the projects never take a break. There's great satisfaction in seeing new ideas come into being an change the way we do our work in a positive way.
good,great place. Supportive of military and veterans. Management in touch. Co-workers easy to get along with. Great team members.
good,"Good benefits"
good,"In this position, the company puts teammate against teammate for promotion and salary increase.  This hyper-competitive environment lends itself to disloyalty and poor team dynamics.  It's an amazing place to work with world class technology and engineers."
good,Intel is a good company where there are a lot of challenge tasks working at intel. Of course too big could mean less opportunity for me to show off my personal skills
good,I really enjoyed working for Intel.  It was hard work and cutting edge but the bonus plan and rewards made it all worth it.
good,Great opportunity to work in a very large corporation.  Gained much experience and had much opportunity here.
good,"Typical day I went about my business independently. I had contact with others on team to verify what was needed and how I could be most helpful."
good,"Worked Siebel Administrator and responsible developing alert mechanism for all siebel environments."
good,"•	Responsible for Mechanical and Process Engineering/Design (3D)/IT/Development."
good,Good place to learn and apply the coursework to real world hardware design
good,Working at Intel was good so far. Got to learn many new things.
good,"Work/life balance is great, however, you must realize that you are at a large organization that has little room for progression. If you are looking for a company to settle, then this would be ideal."
good,"Great technology and great people."
good,"every day is a productive day "
good,It was good working at intel.The management and team were very good to work it
good,"work 9 hours at least in a typical  day. leaned Video Processing, codec via coding and testing in addition to 3 one-week trainings."
good,"If you are a fresher, have interest to join Manufacturing Industry. it's a Best Place to Work. But Less salary."
good,"all people are friendly"
good,Working on application development and Services using COM based C++ programming for Mobile Broadband Features
good,Structured work environment and fun colleagues. Benefits are great and there's plenty of opportunity to improve operating procedures.
good,Good place to work. Had very good learning experience both technical & functional. Very good environmental friendly place to work.
good,"*A typical day of work at, Intel Corporation, was to come in and complete shift-to-shift passdown,with previous shift. Find out if there was any unfinished job assignments,from previous shift. Log into the workstation and see what maintenance or assignments were due or upcoming for tools,on your shift."
good,I started working for Intel as my first engineering job.  The hours can be long especially if you are in manufacturing but you learn a lot.
good,Great place to work because of staff and students. Allowed creative teaching to help the learning process.
good,Surrounded by brilliant mentors and engineers of all backgrounds allowed me to absorb so much knowledge and develop a good understanding of my personal strengths.  This cemented my decision to become an engineer.
good,"I worked as PCB design engineer in the Mobile Communication group of Intel Technology India Pvt.Ltd.I am responsible for designing the layout of form factor reference design for phones and tablets. Currently I am working on board layout using Allegro 16.x for next generation FFRDs that reach market as vertical customer brand. I work closely with FUB owners, design engineers, SI/PI Engineers to implement the design requirements of highly complex board layouts. I also work closely with manufacturing engineer, Mechanical engineers and Vendors to ensure DFM/DFA from system standpoint. Being a major stakeholder, I attend the board development meetings dedicated for resolving board layout issues, providing status updates, raising the concerns and driving the design schedules. I also attend System level working group dedicated for resolving the system level issues and providing the solutions compatible with both mechanical and DFM/DFA aspects. I also attend SI/PI working group dedicated for feasibility and assessment of SI/PI aspects. I have extensive experience in end-to-end quality layout design of complex, dense, cost-effective, high-speed, controlled impedance, high volume multilayer PCBs using Allegro 16.x tool. Also I have a strong knowledge in the field of EMI/EMC. Some of the responsibilities I had designing PCBs are stackup closure, Route study/placement feasibility, schedule estimation, placement as per system guidelines, routing as per PI/SI/DFM/DFA/EMC guidelines, Internal and external layout review, Gerber generation, PCB fabrication and assembly feedbacks closure."
good,I did not enjoy working for Intel since I don't think that they value work and life balance. It is strictly only working. Co-workers were not friendly at all.
good,"enjoyed working there,management was good,co workers were nice team to work with"
good,Intel is a great place to work.  Pay is good benefits are great.  Very fast moving ambiguous and very stressful at times.  I have a great job and love my freedom to explore.
good,Company with a culture that challenges your engineering skills and yet motivates your work-life balance.
good,Transition is occuring to agile methods for software development
good,i love that company cos it has been my dream of place were i want to work
good,"Great place to work. Friendly and helpful coworkers. Considerate management. Wonderful benefits. Albuquerque is a very unique place, not suited for everyone."
good,"Most of the time i work in labs, which is most innovative place in Intel."
good,"Industry leader, however they tend to treat their employees like the chips they make, a commodity"
good,Intel's values and benefits only apply if you are a blue badge
good,"The people I worked with at Intel were great. Compensation was very good. Intel as most people know is a demanding place to work and that can be a good thing or bad depending on your state of mind. I spent a portion of my time on the production floor making sure my builds went as planned. I spent a lot of time planning DOE and builds to assure qality targets were met before product release. I created build plans, reviewed failure annalysis reports on all defects and reported out the final results to management."
good,"As a manufacturing technician, your job is not that easy because they always depend on you as the production overall performance matter.They have good management and good benefits also but you will feel the pressure sometimes with your co-workers.I would say the hardest part of this job is when you machine is down and not working but you still have to meet your goal for the day, it gives you pressures..Most enjoyable was those community services activity, at least you get some break from work and got a chance to bond with you friends outside the company premises."
good,Very Friendly environment. Really loved to be associated to Intel
good,While working here i learned your damned if you do and damned if you don't.
good,I enjoyed the open-ness to teach what you do not know. Also the teamwork environment was great.
good,"Typical day is filled with numerous meetings, some of which did not need to be. Through corporate training I learned methodology that enabled me to solve real life intricate and advcanced finance problems. Mid level and Junior level Managers could do more in the development of newly hired associates. Excellent relationship with open minded and competitive peers"
good,"Nepotism Running wild, they should be able to hire the best and brightest! They hire friends and family over quality. Not the company policy, just what they do."
good,"I provided administrative support to the purchasing and engineering department of a large International technology development corporation, developed and implemented standard operating procedures for data procurement, verification and management, updated databases with current valid data for all engineering and purchasing departments to utilize and loaded support documentation to the corporate repository. The people I worked with were kind and helpful and I would have loved becoming a permanent part of their team."
good,1. Nice projects
good,"My biggest learning out of this company was I acquired and discovered my strengths: I'm very data driven, disciplined and results oriented. Two of these are Intel Values. Management is mostly technical and reviews are performance based."
good,Intel is a great company to work at - has history in the Si Valley and the opportunity to really make a difference in the future of computing.
good,"Intel provides a good job (starting pay, benefits, hours) for mechanical technicians but very little in the way of advancement for this job role.  The mechanical tech role has no real opportunities to learn anything outside of your very specific job scope, meaning you only gain experience on limited equipment.  Some of the more in demand skills in the industry (electrical troubleshooting, basic I&C skills) we aren't allowed to do due to company policy.  Overall the mechanical technician role is not a bad job just not a good career if you're a younger person looking to learn new skills or advance up ""the ladder""."
good,Always consider for their employee continue learning during working at Company as a help our improve our english Skill and get higher current license at University.
good,Intel has hired little or no technical experienced personal in the manufacturing field. Times have changed and so has its culture making it harder to train and uneasy as far as the quality of time wasted in its training
good,Very cubicle world to work in. Different business culture than the norm. Very culturally diversified place to work. Hard to move up within the company. High expectations from management
good,"Good place to work, good benefits for the employee, butb nothing for consultant."
good,Good company but drove me into the ground with international travel. Specifically to Malaysia.   Management quality varies with each organization.   Very grateful for this opportunity to work here.
good,"Great comp and benefits but you will likely feel like a cog in a giant machine.  Bureaucracy and pacifying the whims of social policy seem to have taken the company hostage.  Meritocracy is long gone and now those that can play the game well, win."
good,"A typical day could be very busy with multiple responsibilities. The culture and management are ok. The hardest part is the on-call, the best part is the salary."
good,"I worked in multiple business units. Where you work, who  your management is, really matters. Can be a super place to work. Can also be really tough, though."
good,"Provides opportunities for learning and personal growth. But due to large work force, there is less visibility of your work and talent. Good place if you want work life balance."
good,"Intel is a great place as far as competitive compensation and health benefits. The only issues for myself that I've seen is the work place culture is quite unique between groups. Furthermore, it seems hard for career advancement in moving up within the company. I have known many who have left and then applied from the outside and received better options than they would have by staying and working their way up."
good,Overall a good place to work but it is competitive. The annual review process is too competitive and raises are very small when the company is doing very well!
good,"Good Place to learn and explore new technology but the culture at Intel is changing from a pure tech to more business driven, therefore, short term gains are more important then long term gains."
good,"Salary, bonus, stock and benefits are top notch.  Work environment is highly competitive and unpleasant.  Work life balance is good with ability to work from home and decent onsite gym facilities and cafe.  Management says one thing and does another.  No trust for management by employees.  Difficult to advance or get promotion.  Training available for new technologies but no opportunity to use them on the job."
good,Good work/life balance.  Very diverse company.   Flexible work options.  Excellent technology.  Wonderful cafeteria facilities.  Wordwide locations and technology.
good,"Productive place to work. With great benefits,and compensation for their employees. Multiple weeks of vacation time with sick and personal days for their employees."
good,The work day is a typical day.  You need steel toe boots and a hard hat.  There are many people working together at once.  You have normal break hours and lunch.  You don't have to clock in or out
good,"Working for Intel was a positive experience.  You worked hard, but there were opportunities to have fun too. The company strived to offer work/life balance to its employees, but unfortunately it fell short at times because of strict deadlines, heavy workload, etc. "
good,"In my 30+ year career, both my favorite job and my least enjoyed jobs were both with Intel.  When times are good, you can fairly freely transfer from one job assignment to another.  When times are lean, not so much.  So whether you enjoy the job or not depends a lot on what group you land in, the manager, the environment, etc."
good,"I learned a lot about hardware and was forced to learn independently and at a fast rate.  Management is mostly tech leads and can be a little rough around the edges for some team members.  Howeever, a great opportunity to work on large scale global projects."
good,The company is the safest place I have ever worked. They value a safe work environment and stopping the job when you feel uncomfortable is not shunned upon. I appreciated that and having the open door policy to speak with any level of management is a plus as well.
good,"good place for self-starters who know how to navigate corporate politics"
good,"Công việc làm đêm, phải xoay ca vaw không có nhiều cơ hội thăng tiến."
good,"Company has a difficult time in visualizing a strategic direction that will work - and then sticking to it. Even in today's world, it is too volatile."
good,"Intel is a great place to work to continue your education, and gain valuable information about the semi-conductor industry.  Intel culture focuses on Safety, Quality, then Output.  I definitely feel safe working in the fab."
good,"Great company for salary and benefits, but ultimately just a number. Wage discrepancies between the same job level are vast and the shift calander means you never get a full weekend to yourself."
good,Good place to work. Work life balance is good. Can work independent.A wonderful work culture where we can reach people at any level without any restrictions and share our Ideas productively.
good,Good team of people and exciting new projects. Worked with top architects in the industry and learned a lot about CPU architecture and design process.
good,"There are big ideas. There are a lot of ideas. Any of them could become true at any time. So do everything you can to do everything the best you can."
good,My manager helped me to learn new programming language through work (AngularJS). It was very challenging to learn a new language and at the same time experiment that at work. It worked perfectly well for our application development at Intel. Even after I quit after my internship I can relate to those learning days and how that app has come along so well and used across different teams at Intel.
good,"Intel was once a progressive, growth-oriented company.  Over the years the corporate attitude has changed and the workplace culture along with it.  There are tremendously talented and hardworking people there however, in my opinion, the management culture has migrated to be less personal and supportive of employees."
good,"I was able to create new job positions for myself by identifying gaps and creating solutions; this only works at Intel if you can find someone high enough up in the food chain that cares about the problems and solution you are offering. "
good,Intel Corporation is an American multinational corporation and technology company. It is the world largest and highest valued semiconductor chip makers based on revenue.
good,Intel keeps their finger on the pulse of the mental aspect of management. they are always get data on how to train their managers to be better and get more out of the employees.
good,"Good pay, but it is stressful, you will work hard for your pay when called on. You need to be proactive in your own advancement. SAFETY is not an option, some things may seem silly but they are there because someone messed up... so be safe...;)"
good,As with any job if your manager is supportive and fosters an atmosphere of inclusion and growth you'll have a chance at a great future there.  Otherwise you're sunk.
good,Intel is a great place to start your journey as an engineer coming in from college. There's so many people from all kinds of backgrounds that can pass on their years of experience to you. I would say that it tends to be an older company with people that are in the middle of their career. Networking internal is possible with initiative and work is based on position or drive. A typical day can be filled with meetings or just engineering development based on your role.
good,"•Planning, coordination of projects between department, vendors, delegated work to 33 + employees, generated rough drawings, assistance in transition into Auto Cad 2003, seismic anchoring, relocation, assembly adding equipment,  seismic anchor,  lab table, lab equipment, environmental units, laser optics, server racks, cabinets, installation new/used cubicle compression, decompression, furniture repairs, trouble-shooting sit stand and repairs, managed cores and keys, ordered parts, ergo evaluations recommendations, to ergonomic standards, OSHA, State regulations,  reported, updated projects, deadlines in some cases costs to management. Liaison with various vendors involved in projects, assistance in the execution of other department projects or related, hands on in some case to compete work deadlines as required."
good,"They provided a very fun environment for inters, but still provided many resources for interns to get a lot of work done.  Managers were very understanding and worked with interns to make sure they weren't overwhelmed with work, but also had enough to do."
good,"Intel is a good company to work for with many opportunities to continuously learn and develop, a solid compensation package, and the ability to work with many talented people around the globe."
good,"Well established tech company sometimes slow to react to the direction of the market.  Otherwise, a good company to work for with good work-life balance depending on your org."
good,"Even though this was a very demanding company and position, I very much made a lot of friends and had fun with great co-workers. I was saddened to see Intel leave the state of Washington."
good,Intel is a good company to get a view how a fast paced tech company works. The company is currently going through business transition and it is putting a lot of thrash on its finance employees.
good,"In the past 20 years working for this company, I've made quite a significant contribution to the company to finish my work on schedule."
good,Good use of engineers in project planning and execution. Project teams were run well. Had access to management. Worked on a number of valuable projects.
good,"Working for a world class micro chip manufacturer has its ups and downs. When things are going good for the company the mood is relaxed, the purse strings are loosened up and life is good. When things go array the tension builds to get the company back on track. The focus is turned 100% to getting the company back into profitably as quick as possible. Long hours and short tempures abound."
good,"Competitive work environment, challenging work, poor work/life balance, good benefits provided,  jobs continue to shift outside the United States to low cost geos"
good,"!00,000 Type A personalities under one roof is generally fine, and there is extreme discipline in the Fabs (manufacturing), which is cool. However, non-core groups are variable in discipline and values."
good,You get to meet a lot of great people and work on cross site projects.  People needs to manage their time effectively to be able to compete with your peers.
good,My time with Intel was a good learning experience. Being on the inside and seeing how things work in one of the biggest company's of the world was time well spent. The company has a good clean work culture and arrange regular social events for employees.
good,"Intel provides ample learning and professional development opportunities. The people who work there need to know hardware, operating systems, compilers, and things more complicated than say, HTML and Javascript, so you tend to find a very different crowd to that you see on Facebook or Google or other web companies."
good,"Combines high technology, manufacturing, and business operations in one area.  Many of the positions at Intel are multifaceted allowing one to comprehend both the major directions and technical details of the business.  The business model is also sustainable given the fact that near term profits are integrated to funding new technology development keeping the company 5-7years ahead of the nearest competition.  Such detail, along with technical uncertainty in new technologies, and pressing business needs makes for a very stressful environment.  Despite the public view, new technology development is very fast pace and requires out of the box thinking to problem solve issues no one in the industry has had to contend with previously.  Large company issues with different centers of management control remain problematic, albeit better than others I've experienced.  Intel culture has you owning a problem you see, until you can adequately hand it off. There is less of the ""not my department"" attitude, that can be quite frustrating for those outside of the company. A redeeming fundamental is that Intel used to be a performance based reward system (merit base).  So no matter your ""station"", your growth in the company is based on your performance.  Unfortunately, not all ""performance"" gauges are equal, so as with many large companies, your immediate manager determines your growth or progression in the company.  A more near term concern is the advent of managers who don't have the knowledge base or experience of their employees nor willingness to promote their reports beyond their role."
good,"Fast paced organisation"
good,Intense design work allows for fast learning. Able to rotate through different departments to learn different skills. People were nice and there was good food also.
good,"Intel is a great place to work and has a competitive environment. "
good,Work/ Life balance is not quite good but overall OK to work for. Good salary/benefit. Restructuring in progress. Management totally depends on each specific team but overall not efficient at all.
good,"Saw a lot of good long time employees were let go in recent years.  Their replacements are sometime lower calibrate."
good,"I was busy after school"
good,A high tech Company where everything is automated. New employees are sent on vendor training in various places all over United States.
good,"In a typical day in my last position I fulfilled management tasks of monitoring the user stories assigned to all developers, as well as allocating work to every individuals in a team. Throughout the day I completed duties like attending scrum calls and status update calls,drafting design documents and emails. I also provided strong customer service and resolved customer issues.I was involved in development of various catalog items and development of UI.I have created many test case documents and helped in migration of customizations from test environment to production environment."
good,I have worked many places and I wasn't happy with Intel. The people were very nice and the work was fine. Compucom was the contract company and they were terrible. They were there only for themselves. We were underpaid for the type of work they expect.
good,"Responsible for verification and compliance testing of physical layer of PCIe protocol. Working on test chip for next gen High Speed I/O to support various protocols like PCIe, Thunderbolt, USB"
good,"good learning oportunities"
good,"opportunity to do different things every day."
good,Great place to work.  Larger sites have more career opportunities than smaller sites. Work/life balance depends on team - could be very good or could be very bad. Good compensation compared to some other companies.
good,"Great place to work, great benefits, love the compressed work week and wish more companies would follow suit, clean work environment, great safety culture and sabbaticals (4 weeks after four years of service or 8 weeks after 7 years of service)."
good,very collaborative work environment. high work ethics and discipline.   management advocate for personal and career growth through training and job rotation within the company.
good,"good place to start your career, and gain strong technical skills. "
good,"Work-life balance is very good."
good,I worked for Cadence followed by acquisition and stayed and was employed for only few months; consequently unable to provide meaningful feedback.
good,"Worked with architecture board study layout design most time, it was a challenging with unorganized and work process and unknowing design rules upfront makes difficult to do it right first time at the PCB level."
good,Overall a good company to work for benefits and salary wise.  Absolutely no job security as top performers can be torpedoed by one bad manager giving one bad review.
good,Typical workday starts @ 8 and ends around 6 pm.. I learned a great deal working at Intel I was blessed with the ability to move around the company and work in many functions and develop my skill set over the years.  The one thing I really like about Intel with the people I worked with and for the most part management.  The hardest part of my job was to constantly have to deal with the politics of getting my job done.  Often times it would require a lot more stakeholder management than I thought was productive to get decisions made and commitment from management on decisions.
good,"Meetings to design and validate employee internal applications"
good,"Intel is a productive work environment that will allow you to work on on cutting edge technology and improve skills in different areas. However, there is little to no opportunities available for career advancement here."
good,"•	Over 7 years of experience in the field of IT including two years of experience in Hadoop ecosystem and good object oriented programming skills"
good,Intel takes great lengths to ensure you are happy career by providing the opportunity for temporary assignments.   Have been with the company for a number of years and have no major complaints about they treat their employees.
good,"Buen Ambiente de trabajo, con buen compañerismo, y gran aprendizaje"
good,It is a wonderful company that offers a lot of benefits to it's employees.  The free coffee and fruit is great.  The bonuses are awesome.
good,"Intel is like any large corporation in that there are management teams out there who do not work for or believe in their employees. But then again, there are excellent managers at Intel you can work for, if lucky, that really recognize the values of their employees. Intel does have excellent pay and benefits they provide to their employees. The greatest part about Intel is the highly skilled extremely intelligent people you get to work with."
good,"Very demanding, global teams so you work at all hours of the day/night.  Very data based decision making, not always a friendly culture, little trust in senior management.  Great pay/benefits."
good,"Intel is a competitive work environment with focus on meritocracy. Hard work and results are rewarded; when budgets permit. Transparency and Integrity are preached, but not always followed. employee growth and training are encouraged; if budgets permit. co-workers are hard working and there are no slackers on any team. Intel employees are very loyal."
good,"Ambiente de trabalho bom, colegas de trabalho  bons, parte mais dificil do trabalho localização dos clientes quando encontrados a negociação quase sempre era concluida com sucesso."
good,"Great place to work to gather technical knowledge and new technologies.  However, there are many layers of management, credits not provided to the right person."
good,The blue machine is efficient for manufacturing. An individual goes with the giant and shares the money. It is not a place for creativity. It is place for team work. Every may feel the team is not taking inputs for him.
good,Intel strongly favors aggressive men.   There is little room for women to advance in this company.  Many of the managers are foreign men who come from countries where women are shown no respect and it carries over to the company management.
good,Great company to work for. high pressure environment. constant dead lines moving. Fair compensation. some of the smartest people on the planet.
good,"I worked at Intel in lots of different departments."
good,"(1)My hard working and team work got recognized."
good,"management driven; a bit top heavy but there's good work-life balance. innovation is at an individual level, as with many places; you don't find it in management style."
good,"Excellent co-workers."
good,"Shift 4 was off shift hours.12 hour shift, 6 PM to 6 AM. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and every other Saturday. Intel tried to keep a good work life balance, but by the time you would get off for the weekend you would need a full day of recovery frombeing exhausted from being overworked and undermanned. Intel was a good company, allowed to be casual and comfortable clothing. Had a Great Place to Work (GPTW) center with a pool table, ping pong and TV. Had an onsight cafeteria with many options of food to eat. Managers could have more experience on how to communicate and delegate work. Enjoyed my co-workers, but a few complained a bit about management and engineering that owned toolsets. Ergo safety was the hardest part of the job due to being in confined spaces and awkward positions. We also deal with deadly chemicals that could kill you in an instant if exposed, but there were many safeguards in place for leak detections, spills, and continous airflow for clean room to keep particles below 20 ppm. The enjoyable part of Intel was when they would celebrate holidays at work and have bbq's or catering for special events and GPTW events during on and off shift."
good,"Good company"
good,Intel is a fantastic company to begin a career. The open door policy and people development focus creates a healthy work environment that fosters skill development.
good,A great place to work. Eye on commitment and quality. Great benefits. Flexible work schedule.
good,"can learn lots of new staff"
good,"An awesome place to work if you are an Internal Contract Employee, an Intern, or a full-time employee.  I was unfortunate to have been a ""green badge"" contingent worker, and it was tough.  Had to always go through managers to deal with conflicting ideas or issues that arose from arrogant full-time workers.  The challenge of the work was great and kept me always on my toes.  When you fixed a mission critical problem for the group you felt accomplished.  Loved working with my co-workers in my team to tackle huge problems.  "
good,"A typical day has many challenges and can be exciting. It can be difficult to move longer term projects along as you may be constantly putting out fires or keeping daily priorities on track. As a process engineer, you may also be required to have your phone with you and be where you can respond either by phone or computer."
good,"My situation in some regards is not unique. You are hired to fill a particular role. Intel is not particularly inclined to allow you to rise above said position, even if you acquire considerable amounts of education along the way. I did not use the tuition reimbursement program. I paid 100% for my graduate degrees. Mind you, Intel will tell you repeatedly that they are all about getting their people moved up within. Management is very skilled in lip service that sounds really palatable. "
good,"Its fun working with Intel."
good,"Flex time"
good,"Enjoyed working there"
good,The best part of working at Intel is the diversity of people you become friends with.
good,"Intel is a great company to start your career. However the longer you work there, the more politics and bureaucracy impede your ability to make real change within the company. There are lots of old people who have invested their lifetime into building a career here and are not about ready to give up their power and control to the disruptive and innovative ideas of the company's newest hires. So spend a few years here and then move on to another company that will better embrace risk taking and new ideas."
good,Developing data solutions to complex problems enabling new fields of analysis.
good,There isn't much room for advancement in the specific Business Unit I work in.
good,Overall a very nice company to work for. Opportunities to advance your career depends on the group you are working in. Leadership and job skills development opportunities are plenty.
good,Great company for career building and technical skills development. Excellent compensation and benefits package.
good,The vast majority of people I have worked directly with at Intel would not last long in a normal job environment.
good,best job ever. sad how after an engineer leaves and a business man takes over the shift changed from caring for the employee to the profit margin. bring the jobs back. keep America moving.
good,PM on hitch metel ecth tool. Vaccum systems. Bad mangement. Co work ok. Dealing with other shift.
good,I meet some great people. I think I had a bad boss though. The management needs work delegating work and keeping track. 6 months into my job my boss told me I wasn't doing enough work? I came to the conclusion he hadn't been reading my progress reports in which I asked for more. I think it was more a result of his boss asking what he was doing!
good,"It requires hard effort on how to solve problems, design a project and accomplish the deadlines on time."
good,"Great place to work, then bad place to work. The politics cost alot of job losses. False sense of job security. Low rate of retirement across the board. A sense of daily watch if departments are going away."
good,"Lots of smart people, however, there were management missteps."
good,"Repetitive work with little variation. The manufacturing process is high tech, your part is not. Maintenance is again, very routine and repetitive with a limit on depth of knowledge for troubleshooting."
good,There are so many organization change almost every year and small restructuring happens a lot. Need to prepare and have the good relationship with other department to survive from this organization changes.
good,"They had a lot of different tasks for us to complete that included all the different aspects of their company, the main activity they made us do was to create a workshop and the best teams got rewards."
good,Good place to work for people that are willing to work hard and know their stuff.  Intel became very PC in the last 15 years and that killed the culture somewhat.  We had to learn to be nice so people stopped being honest.
good,"Stimulating environment. People with drive can always find projects that meet their interest."
good,"Intel's work life balance culture is one of the best. Everyone respects your work time and also non-work hours. Although many of us do work during our non-work hours since we work across multiple geos. But no one is watching what time you come into the office or what time you go home. Lots of flexibility in creating your own schedule, as long as you get your work done."
good,"Every 6 month you're measured by management against others on the same level. 5% must be bad, 5 % must be good, the remainder in between... regardless of how well or how much everyone works. Even if everyone is excellent, there must be the 5% bad. If you are in the bad, no salary increase, if you're not  in the excellent, only salary raise for inflation. Be bad 4 times in a row, you loose the job. So if you do not work  beyond what's officially required, you can loose your job!"
good,"Pros:"
good,"Good pay once you put in your time. Low ball hiring pay."
good,"Intel is a great place to work, but you need to have an agenda. You will get lost in the crowd if you just try to get by. In order to advance and get to where you want, you need to take initiative and volunteer for projects or roles outside of your defined job function."
good,"At Intel, the only thing that matters is results (as long as they are achieved using approved business and engineering practices).  Said another way: Intel ties may good attributes into ""practices"" and corporate culture.  For example: Intel believes in diversity, but not because it is socially responsible, but because it's good for business."
good,Work life balance is dependent on your ambition. Plenty of roles can be managed with lower hours. The org is very matrix-ed leading to challenges on decision making.
good,"Good place to get started in tech. Finance has a rotation job culture with pretty limited opportunities for long term growth in the Bay (most jobs in Oregon). Tough, long hours on earnings cycle but overall good work life balance."
good,"In the grand scheme of things, they are the leaset of many evils.  For the most part I would have to say the culture makes a concerted effort to value the employees and balance the drive toward technological advancement."
good,Una gran empresa donde se mide por resultados y te dan la independencia para lograrlo.  Dependiendo de la región a la que se pertenezca el enfoque puede cambiar y al ser empresa de tecnología hay muchas reestructuraciones.
good,Good place to work. Great benefits. Dress code was relaxed. They had toast masters onsite. I joined it. It as fun. Learned how they manage sales information.
good,"I was A Contract Layout Designer."
good,"Intel has Flexible timing at work and good perks"
good,Nothing of value here.  I'm sure that the company of today is far different than the one of the dot com boom. I'm adding a few more characters to make the website happy.  I'm over by 36.
good,"Cutting edge technology development always accompanies with challenges and unknowns, but this place provides a great opportunity for people to learn new knowledge every single day. I enjoy working with a group of people who are committed to solve problems in order to finish the tasks. I also enjoy learning ne"
good,What I learned is that PTD/LTD is not representative of the rest of the organization.  My recommendation is to stay away from LTD/PTD if possible.  Unnecessarily stressful environment.
good,"The new business initiatives group has an entrepreneurial culture. The individuals in our group, and the management team worked together to develop innovative solutions to pressing problems. The project team was amazing. For example, the team managers would meet on a weekly basis to discuss progress and challenges, define next steps and assign responsibilities. Then every week, every meeting participant would either have there assignments complete, or would have spent the week communicating with the team about roadblocks. Then, in the next meeting we would develop strategies to get around the road blocks and move forward. I have never worked with such a dedicated and professional team."
good,Management understands need for work/life balance but not always willing to help employees achieve it if it conflicts with other management priorities.
good,Intel is a great place to work. It is very fast paced and I gained a tremendous amount of knowledge and new skills from working there. I have never met a more brilliant conglomeration of engineering minds from all over the world. It was an honor to connect with and assist this future generation
good,"Can develop good work/life balance. A little behind the times on development practices. Hardest part of the job is dealing with the bureaucracy/dinosaurs, but your work positively affects a lot of people."
good,"The departments always say they work together, but they don't."
good,"My work interactions were mostly contained to a small group and email correspondence with remote offices and customers. Large meetings were infrequent; meetings were usually a small group and mostly on an as-needed basis."
good,Not a full time employee. I was a contractor. Not sure what type of review you were looking for but I was a contract employee. I did my job and worked hard to maintain the schedule so I really can't say much.
good,"+Had interesting projects as intern that could actually lead to a product, unlike many other software related internship projects."
good,"Good place to work, nice benefits, paid leaves, courses offered to broadening my career, good food in cafe, nice co-workers, but very stressful and my last manager was a nightmare to work for."
good,Really enjoy working with the business teams and the subject matter. Really don't enjoy working with management. Very limited opportunities for development and for advancement.
good,"great benefits, management not in touch with maintenance personal.  They would rather manage from a desk than out on the floor in real time.  Question you about everything, and expect you to memorize hundreds of procedures and follow them to a ""T"" during a crises."
good,"There are several pockets of good teams within Intel, with highly motivated people. Great company which allows employees mobility cross functions and organizations"
good,Amazing learning platform. Groundbreaking technology and very supportive team. Intern management could have been better though. Work culture is really good.
good,"Under BK, Intel got rid of a lot of senior people and had the people that remained do the job the senior person was doing, plus the one they already had."
good,With Intel it's all manager discretion. There is a high over turn with managers. There is a change every two years or so. If there is bad management you can't grow properly and there can be a great deal of judgement.
good,"The company does offer great benefits to their employees."
good,Great place to work. The support is very positive to help you get focused to do your job. Its alway a challenge working. Management is very supportive.
good,"Intel used to be a much better working place. Now most of the work moving to low cost geological areas (mainly Asia). Employees in US severely affected by this. As Intel's grip loosing as the number one in chip manufacturing, management try to reduce employees in unethical manner."
good,"There are many opportunities at Intel but not always the easiest to navigate.  Expectations are high and the environment can be highly competitive, and not always supportive.  "
good,"In general very fast paced and stressful work, but most people there are very nice. However advancement is very difficult for Techs (IE non-engineers), and most techs will never get better hours beyond a 12 hour condensed shift, many of which are swing or night shifts. Management can also be pretty obnoxious in the labs since most managers are just senior engineers forced into management positions. This means they tend to know very little about anything outside the scope of their own world (ie, hours, vacation time, timecards even...)."
good,"The workplace environment is easily changing from day to day."
good,I like to work every time I work is that Acacian to meHow work is the pay off And while you’re working you have to have forwarded you have to know what you’re doing to like your job so I’m comfortable with my hands and working hard
good,"Small teams of people who work hard at the job, intel offered various incentives for doing a job well. Night shifts were paid extra as the 12 hour shifts could be taxing."
good,"The people awesome to work with from all backgrounds. If need training in semiconductors, Intel is the best. The Start ups were an opportunity to be creative."
good,"Intel is usually a fun place to work. Like most places, it depends on the department, shift and so on. I have not had any bad experience with the company. I really enjoyed working there."
good,Maintaining Work life balance with extensive travel.  Projects tended to be often approved by Senior  management without discussing with task owners prior to acceptance and understanding the risk factors.  These type of issues usually were solved with large amounts of money that could have been avoided in a better planning phase prior to acceptance without input form key stakeholders.
good,"Good collaborative environment in which to work and develop professional skills necessary for personal growth. "
good,"Been with Intel for 15 years.  Great place to work, but consider your career base pay as that which you get hired with.  Promotion opportunities are incredibly difficult when you get 2+ managers per year deciding your fate.  I could be jaded, but believe this is the norm."
good,"I let work take over my life. Some people are good at balancing their commitments with their lives, but not me. I frequently worked 7 days a week, holidays, nights, early mornings, etc. Totally not worth that."
good,"Pros. "
good,"Good salary and benefits. Good team mates, smart people. Free fruit everyday. Depending on your group, you will speed ahead in your career or languish without a promo for years. The irony is that they say you're not there yet for a promo, but then they will lay you off for staying in the same level for a long time. But then if they promote you, you might get laid off for not performing. The bell curve grading of employees is bad."
good,Intel has a large network of job opportunities. They have a hard time diversifying their product lines from CPU's and servers. They won't use industry standard tools such as cadence and calibre making employees less valuable in the job market. Not as friendly toward contractors even though they use them.
good,Intel is a good company to work for. Culture is ok. Salary and benefits not comparable with other tech companies. Managements are not very bright. Going through transformation at the moment.
good,"The best thing I like about Intel is that it's super easy to network with people and there are so many activities always happening."
good,"I learned a lot while working at Intel--challenging and interesting assignments made a wonderful ecosystem for a lifelong learner.  However, while the company has a goal of significantly improving diversity, in the 10 years that I worked there little to no progress was made and resulted in a revolving door for those not feeling included!"
good,I enjoyed working with my bosses. Never a dull moment at work. It's always busy so the day passes quickly. Computer system is up-to-date. Location is nice.
good,"I believe the high-level management and human resources are trying to improve the diversity conditions. There are good hiring practices however, retain is an issue.  I have experienced during my career cases of bias, unfair treatment, etc. There is a lot of room for improvement to make some organizations to retain their diverse force and employees.  Middle managers and directors have to be not only educated (many policies are trying to correct this) but, properly audited when employees leave to understand why certain groups are not able to retain their general employees, minorities or women. Retaliation policies should be guaranteed with audits and not taken for granted since company policies are not always executed as they should. Many managers are using review cycles as a way to retaliate against employee when employee is trying to change jobs."
good,The management wasnt all that good it was a couple issues with pay checks. somehow my taxes was messed with when i didnt even go in. Clean room environments are always good places to work it not too loud and everybody is on task. I enjoyed working there lots of communication and outstanding team work.
good,科技業技術更新與產業動態與英特爾息息相關，挑戰與成就感都很高。公司文化強調積極進取與執行的紀律，對新科技的不斷追求也激勵員工勇於創新。
good,Intel can be a great place to work. I learned a lot about microprocessor engineering while I worked at Intel. I worked with a whole bunch of incredible engineers.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Intel, however, it seemed as though Intel never had any interest in developing our group's products.  They basically let the product go as long as they could without any investment and then closed the business unit once keeping the service going was no longer tenable."
good,Overall it was a good job. A typical day was to arrive for a pass down meeting and pick up where the last shift left off. The only time it was stressful is if a tool went down and production stops and you might have to try to fix it real fast while engineers are constantly asking if it's up and do their wafers first.
good,"An opportunity to work on cutting edge technology, with nice corporate culture,  above the average salary, decent bonus payout, lot of benefits for employees."
good,Intel is a good company to work for. The environment can be very competitive where each team member is supposed to figure out a way to outdo their fellow team members in some way by the end of each year in order to be ranked successful. The yearly review process is unhealthy and needs to be abolished similar to other large companies.
good,"Intel is a great place to work, all employees are treated at the same level. The work culture is the best, lot of experienced people around to always help and guide"
good,"Overall, Intel has been a grate place to work; demanding but fair; Result and customer oriented, value and respect diversity. Very process and system oriented"
good,"As with most large, established companies, there's a rigid, corporate structure, which tends to block open communication. Management is okay, but career advancement is extremely difficult as a new grad."
good,"Intel provided great opportunities, but after many years of service was let go. Never had a poor performance review. Decision made at the executive level with no feedback from manager."
good,"Company is aware of people having family, a long as there's good communication on both sides it will work for both parties. Be ready to work overtime as you always have deadlines and projects that fall behind due to constant delays"
good,"Intel is a good place to work; however, co-workers may have difficulty understanding interpersonal relationships. I was fortunate to have very professional supervisors to support."
good,"I have been working Intel over 12 years, overall it's a great company with many leading technologies in industry. I have worked in 3 different roles during my time, and each of them gives many lessons and precious experiences. I enjoy the working in balance of life; learning something new everyday; and satisfaction after sovling the issues with cusotmers."
good,"Get to work with smart people, lots of meaningful projects and roles, managers tend to value work-life balance in finance at least, can be competitive when it comes to annual reviews, unclear career path going forward given CFO changes and recent finance re-org"
good,"Intel is a highly competitive company - with a tremendous value placed on technical skills and background.  The office environment is an open cube environment for all employees.   There are 4 primary states with multiple buildings at each location.  2 in California, 1 in Phoenix and 1 Oregon."
good,"I've worked for Intel Corporation for over two decades, and I've seen various pros and cons.  I'll say that the pros outweigh the cons significantly.  I'm proud to say I work for one of the most ethical corporations in America today, and I'm also happy to be working on the cutting edge of technology."
good,"Great Place to work at the team level.  Upper management roles ignore the rules of HR guidelines when convenient, often crossing legal boundaries as well as good sense."
good,"Good work-life balance. My job wasn't challenging enough at the start, but then it picked up, I wish I had a mentor assigned when I initially started out."
good,"Very challenging, highly motivated and intelligent employees.  Culture can be intimidating if you are unable to take constructive confrontation (ie - have your ideas challenged without taking it personally).  Company will take as much as you give it so YOU need to establish your own worklife balance."
good,"Over the course of my 17 years, I observed the cultural shift from local control of personnel and management structure to the corporate/institutional control leading to impersonal relationships which alienated a large portion of the workforce."
good,Overall they treat their employees well and offer a lot of benefits.  Manufacturing world is competitive.  Job security suffers as factories age. You can have a long career if willing to re-locate.
good,Fast paced environment were learning work/life balance is a necessity to have a successful career. It is very easy to feel lost in your first year but management does a good job with providing mentors to help overcome these feelings.
good,"Electronics, Components, and Semiconductor Manufacturing Engineering Department with replacement parts and supplies building FOSB Silicon Semiconductor Wafers in a Clean-room Environment. Tasks include Inventory Management, and the handling and disposal of chemicals and hazardous materials."
good,"thoi gian lam viec hop ly, hoc duoc van hoa binh dang trong moi truong lam viec, cap quan ly chua duoc toan dien, van hoa cong ty tot, dieu kho nhat trong cong viec la quan ly khong dua duoc tam qua trong cua team di len, dieu thich nhat trong cong viec la lam trong moi truong chuyen nghiep va dung voi chuyen nganh."
good,"Intel is a cutting edge technology organization transitioning to a cost competitive environment in the manufacturing space. The compensation packages are amazing. The environment can be toxic at times, with emphasis on individual vs. team achievement, pressure to continuously rise in ranks or be targeted for removal, and doing more with less resources with no clear path to resolve the dilemma."
good,I remain neutral in my comments about employment with Intel. I had some great experiences with the company however I can also say that I had some not so pleasant ones.
good,"It was a good place to work, if you had a good manager. Since managers were often rotated, that was a bit of a gamble. "
good,"Issues with middle management; otherwise a pretty good place to work.  Would recommend to a friend."
good,Great place to work.  Great opportunities. Great work life balance benefits.  Great opportunities to invest in stocks .  Great medical  and vision benefits.
good,"Despite going through some publicized growing pains, Intel is a great company with knowledgeable senior engineers.  The overall culture is fairly laid back, you're given freedom to work at your own pace as long as project milestones are being hit.  Work can quickly consume most of your waking hours during some project phases, but the same could be said of any tech company these days."
good,It's the world leader in semiconductor manufacturing.  You will learn something everyday but you will also be forced to be on your A game in continuously upgrading your knowledge and skills to be successful at your job.
good,"A typical day at work was fun, sometimes it's slow and easy going , sometimes hectic due to many sudden requests from manager and engineers from within my group to external."
good,"I enjoyed working at Intel for almost 15 years. I held positions as self sustaining tech, engineering tech, and development tech. I left to pursue a degree in Project Management"
good,"its not a bad place to work but politics get a hold on people and the rest is history, benefits are good and the pay is great but the headache is huge. they make sure they let you know how much they are paying you although they do nothing to make you a productive contributor."
good,"Challenging work environment with great talented people from around the world.  Large company with lots of opportunity and great benefits.  It's definitely a work hard, but get to celebrate hard type of environment."
good,"intel has the market share and gets a lot of attention from customers, there are tons of smart people and at times the intel machine can move rather slowly."
good,"Intel is a good company to work for, very ethical, good management and good workplace. I recommend working here. Intel product and technology is also very innovative."
good,Intel is a great place to work as it balances career and personal life. I was part of a great team who respected and supported each other resulting in more productive work.
good,Great place to work. Work culture is very good. Learning is a little less and is more suitable for experienced folks than freshers. Management is supportive.
good,High tech company with opportunities and challenges.   Need to consistantly reinvent yourself to succeed.  Employees need to be aggressive to climb the corporate ladder or will be a layoff risk.
good,"Competitive working environment, continuous learning available. Working in teams to problem solve manufacturing issues.great place to work."
good,"the pay and benefits were great. Unless change does not occur soon, Intel chips will not be the most sought after.  The greatest asset to the company are its people. The workplace culture was in flux when I left.  I wish Intel the best."
good,Company looks after its employees. Great benefits. Work life balance with shift work is very beneficial. Skill improvements and personal development is encouraged
good,"Typical day involved awesome problem solving."
good,"Great place to work, but very poor management. Hired engineers to be managers or promoted within engineer -> manager. Work/life balance was ok, but not the greatest. Required very long hours."
good,Busy from the time you walk in the door until you leave.  Can be very rewarding or draining depending on individual.  Would recommend for employment.
good,"a challenging place to work for technicians with opportunities to work on the most recent equipment in the semiconductor industry. They treated their employees fairly with good benefits, the health insurance is top notch."
good,"The company has began to look like other companies but still has great benefits.  The company is trying to restructure itself due to missing initially on mobile, but longterm it will be successful."
good,The culture is based on productivity and growth. There is expectation to not stagnate and continue to get to the next job level. Productivity and team work were rewarded. There was a great training organization were work and interpersonal skills were learned.
good,"Intel is a very flexible company, but it has become increasingly more difficult to initiate change. New ideas can take over a year to implement. Daily tasks can be found relentless, monotonous and tiring. That being said, I have seen some amazing developments and areas of change within the company. Intel is on the right track to new success, I just believe that sometimes Intel is too big for their own good."
good,"Was mostly an ok job.  At the times the atmosphere was very high stress.  I was a technician paid hourly and the pay was supposedly comparable to the industry. Wage increases were low when they happened.  The people I worked with and around were good people up to and including the second level managers.  Don't care much for the upper level managers though.  "
good,"It really depends on which group you are working with in such big Corporate organization.  Our group was sort of the bottom of the food chain.  As you could imagine, most of the funding resources were not quite there regardless whatever the management was trying to address.  The team I used to work for is a very diversified and everyone is a little bit different with their own character.  No matter how different we are, I learned a great deal from this team and I enjoyed the teammates that I get acquainted to.  Due to the fact that I am at the networking group, we beared a lot of IT costs by natrue.  Therefore, we are not the most blessing children in the family for a fact.  Work-life balance is always emphasized by the management, in reality, it is depending on who your manager is.  Some could be very understanding, but they don't last long.  They do reward people who is working hard enough in most of time.  However, if you are new and a newbie.  It will take a few years before you could even know your resources or the right people to work with your project.  Management is pretty much focus on the number instead of actual work that is related to the individual.  The last thing I heard before I left this company, they are making some changes and hopefully this will get improved."
good,"As a very large company, many different subcultures exist depending on the group you work for.  Some are fantastic and are change adapt while others are close-minded and stubborn to change.  Overall the environment consists of a lot of fire-fighting and not enough focus on implementing corporate standard tools to improve data and work process."
good,"I found Intel to be a very good employer, their top priority in any task performed is Safety, they care about their employee's, this also applies to their dedication in trying to perfect the Work/Life balance."
good,Intel provides opportunities to work in all areas of Intel's business.  Intel provides excellent benefits and work life balance is very flexible.
good,A typical day at work is busy. Many expectations are expected of you to go above & beyond your job. I learned many skills and developed my skill sets. Management has high expectations of you & you better deliver. The best thing about the job was my co-workers. I developed a family working there. The hardest part of my job was keeping up with my job & all the projects I needed to do on the side. But I did love keeping busy & seeing my accomplishments put to use.
good,Intel is a wonderful place to work for someone who is a recent college graduate.  It provides a very good learning opportunity.
good,"Challenging work in a supportive environment. It's no wonder why so many folks want to work here. Great food, too! And good equipment to work with."
good,"It is a great company, but has its struggles these years. Reconstruction happens every year, and changing directions happens often."
good,Its a great company and I am still currently employed there and would be grateful if you did not contact them at this time.
good,"intel is big company , work life balance and great place to work "
good,Work hour is flexible. The team environment i s  fine. The coworkers are nice. Too many changes in the project direction causes uneasiness and creates unhealthy competition among groups.The previous work culture is being lost
good,I really enjoyed working at Intel for last 20 years and had opportunity to contribute to world leading products. Now this company is going through turbulence due to higher management mistakes and hope that management will realize their mistakes.
good,I wonder if the word count here is subjective or if you have used a simple algorithm which does nothing to drive data quality and the integrity of your service?
good,"Good team, Values Employee, Fun to work"
good,"Intel is a large company with many different working subcultures. Some areas have good work/life balance and others can burn you out if you are not a good fit."
good,"After 23 years and 5 different jobs in 3 states, I was actually relieved to exit with a pile of cash and not a lot of tears.  Excited for the next adventure!"
good,Its a really good place with smart people with ample opportunities to innovate and excel. Very good work/life balance and fun to work.
good,"I find that the environment suited at Intel is fairly well rounded. The benefits of eating well,  having infused waters, and free coffee and fruit for blue badges shows that there is room to be healthy here, but you'll have to manage yourself as there will be prolonged sitting as it is required while being at a computer, so I recommend switching positions often. I enjoy the fact that there are many different people on campus and you're bound to find a group to fit into if that's an activity that allows you to engage with others or enjoy the company of your own group. I feel that within this environment I have been achieving skills in managing my time and efforts to what really matters which gives the employees some room to organize and better their efforts at work."
good,Very flexible work hours but many meetings in the early morning or late evening for Program Manager.  Free fruit and beverage.
good,Intel is the best place you can work at if in semiconductors but the business is always up and down. Odds are you will be laid off at some point so shock away you money or have a backup option when the time comes.
good,"It is very stressful job at Intel.  Employee has to work late or bring work home to meet dead-line.  You have to be able to work under pressure to come up with solution to resolve problems/issues.  You work as a team but at the end of the year you will get review as individual,"
good,"A Typical day at work is pretty busy with process, direct manager isn't qualify because he doesn't have management skills. A typical promotion within Intel without meeting qualifications. Therefore make it very difficult to get advance or getting recognition, Co-worker is encourage to tell on each other due to direct manager lacking skills. The hardest part of the job is to get proper training, the most enjoyable of the job is Intel benefits, bonuses."
good,"Challenging Designs. Cutting Edge technology. Leading technology in the industry. "
good,"Intel is a fine company with good benefits and all that, but software at Intel is really hard, and our management couldn't settle on a strategy to save their lives. I felt my input, based on sound reasoning and a proven track record, fell on deaf ears. As a product manager, my own leadership either couldn't get out of my way or have my back. "
good,"Good company, Good People, Still would work there if I wasn't laid off for no budget for are project.  Lot of hard working people and good friends there."
good,"Intel offers a variety of Career opportunities and compensates employees fairly well. The bar is raised yearly and one might find their work/life balance challenged on occasion, due to the global nature of the company and co-workers in multiple regions"
good,"Intel was good to me as an employee, but I think it would hard today to work there and raise a family.   I do not feel they management structure is not as good as it use to be grow employees."
good,Intel was a very friendly and nice place to work.  Moral was a little low because people were always on edge about retaining their jobs.
good,"Worked as a consultant. As a consultant there are not much growth opportunities, However, the work environment is great and there is a lot of learning that comes from a seasoned organisation like Intel."
good,"Fun place to work. A lot of different job opprotunities makes it easy to move around if you get bored. Company has become so big that employees are now ""numbers"" instead of ""people""."
good,"Lots of good people, some very obstinate"
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Intel. I worked on some good projects. But the intel culture is not as dynamic as I was expecting. The work life balance is really great. My team was excellent, and I really felt happy to be part of that team."
good,"-Typical day at work with contract manufacturing preparation readiness and schedule of product loading plan."
good,"Spent more than half my life at Intel."
good,"Worked for 14 years and learned a lot.  There were highs and lows working with 3 departments.  The first 6-8 years were mostly highs because of the learning and experience gained. The last were very stressful because of working long hours and managing additional objectives other than your regular job duties."
good,This job very beneficial. I grew in a lot of different ways working there and learned more about my self in the process. Working as a foreman taught me a lot about manager skills and inventory that I can take on with me at different jobs that i will have in the future.
good,Exciting things happening as company aggressively pursues opportunities outside of its core business.
good,"Excellent and enjoyable place to work. Fitness center for employee well being. The most open Management style I have experienced."
good,Genpact been a pioneer in service provider the organization are well established in various domains and management are structured well which is a plus point for Genpact.
good,There is a lot of major changes happening in management and organizations.  Things are still storming with a lot of teams.  There is also a lot of positive work place updates that make it a great place to work.  The pay is good with lots of flexibility
good,Work environment at most locations is dull but lot of opportunities available for career advancement.
good,"Enjoy the co-workers."
good,"Intel is a great company with amazing benefits. Unfortunately, they've built a safety culture that has grown entirely out of hand. Overall, my experience with Intel has been great."
good,debugging the embedded board s the challenging and interesting task.
good,"Great to be working at the cutting edge of technology. "
good,"•	Provided System Platform testing and deployment in the lab. Built, configured, tested and troubleshot Acrylic system for software and design engineers for complex testing. "
good,Some of the best people I have ever worked with at the Rio Rancho NM plant.
good,"From my short time at Intel, the company and the people were pretty good.  The company demands a lot of your time so be prepared to make sacrifices in your social life.  Chances are you'll have to work 12+ hours a day even if you're hired to work 40 hours per week."
good,"Experience on High Availability and Disaster Recovery like Replication, Log shipping, Mirroring and Clustering and database security and permissions"
good,"Intel recognized the shift to mobile devices early on, it just was not in a good position to execute.  First, Intel did not have the right IP and tried to promote WiMAX instead of 4G/LTE.  Second, x86 was not the default CPU architecture of mobile since ARM held that position.  Third, Intel overinvested in chip capacity failing to recognize that mobile SoCs requiring much less silicon real estate as PC CPUs."
good,"Intel sets a fast pace and demands much from its employees. The reward is a feeling of working toward excellence. However, this search for excellence often comes at a high price for employees. Long, long hours are brutal."
good,"Management of personal. Scheduling of equipment maintenance, equipment repair . Develop procedures for personal training, equipment maintenance, trouble shooting.  Develop and enforce Safety procedures. Troubleshoot and repair complex equipment problems.  Manage personal schedules for vacation allowances. Manage bill of materials and parts inventory"
good,Well organized workplace. I worked with a good team on night shift.
good,I have a great buddy and friendly team members. I learned C# through hands on experience and enjoy being involved in every stages of the software development process. It was fun and challenging. The hardest part of the job is to deal with the equipment and learn how to collect data and manage the communication via equipment interface protocol.
good,"Manage the operation of 1800 GPM DI water system, learned facilities maintenance, good co-workers,"
good,great place to work; managers tend to be isolated and sometimes small minded in their approach to getting the job done.
good,Intel tends to be a world for techno-Geeks. I enjoyed the Geeks side of life but I was hired on to give the technology leads to features of a product leads to benefits of a product leads to presentation of benefits leads to sales. I was the trainer in this chain of events and I loved watching the 'light go on'. 
good,- Smart engineering development teams
good,"Intel is a big company with multiple sites. The culture there promotes political advancement combined with merit. They rely on junior engineers to do all the work and protect a family of senior engineers who are supposedly the visionaries. The company has now come on hard times, missing revenue estimates quarter after quarter and quietly cutting staff."
good,"It was exciting at first, but that went away quickly. They would tell you to work harder, but not too hard but hard. They wanted goals met but we couldn't if we wanted to work safer. It's like saying take your time and hurry up. There were several team conflicts. We had to vote to do something and everyone couldn't agree. The whole process delayed decision making. I didn't like the atmosphere there."
good,"I come in to work prior to starting time to get a pass down from other shift employees to maintain a productive/quality workflow. Learned more about trouble shooting on equipment when non-standard processing occurs due to error. It was challenging but at the same time it was all good experiences on working to resolve the situation. I mostly worked independently on a special process, but as my co-workers soon learned, I worked well as a team member when they needed me too. My co-workers were very good at their job. They put in 110% daily and I was proud to be a part of their team including the management and engineering. My manager/group leader treated me as a true member of his team (even though I was a temp) by personally meeting me and having open communication. The hardest part of my job was leaving (lay off), the most enjoyable part of my job was showing up every morning with a smile."
good,Stable Employer with decent benefits. The management in the company has stale ideas. The company is too focused on execution not on innovation.
good,"I would love to go back to the company, though I did find them less than sympathetic when it came time to layoffs. They didn't take into consideration your time in the job, your past performance appraisals, they just cut. I loved my co-workers, they were fun, inspiring and challenged me to be a better person and employee."
good,"Although my experiences weren't always rosey, I did gain tons of experience and had built some great relationships with the employees and my managers."
good,"interesting chanllenging work, the locations are not very good"
good,"Work life balance is really good here. Most people work from Monday-Friday, 9am-5pm. Only when product releases are coming up is when that may shift to later work hours. Working weekends is rare."
good,Job experience will vary for a number of factors you will have no control over. Over the course of my time there the role evolved significantly to go from hands on technical tool expert to everything automated with predefined actions for most every scenario. Perfect if you don’t like ambiguity and risk. Extremely boring otherwise
good,Standard pros/cons of a large company. Compensation is above average but work culture and job satisfaction especially in the fab related roles are not that great
good,Got into work and generally ran tests on the ssds. Good job overall with its underwhelming moments. Most coworkers kept to themselves but great people overall!
good,"Great company, good people.  Met a lot of friends and coworkers there.  Enjoyed my 10 years there until the end with new manager.  Overall a great fit for me."
good,"Good company to work for, very stressful. Daily meeting to review goals, on call almost 24/7. Good company to learn manufacturing processes and interact with other manufacturing sites across the globe on these processes."
good,"They have almost everything you can think of right on site. You can even get your car detailed, or Dry Cleaning, while you're working. Great food for breakfast and lunch and even food truck days. Spa and a gym too. Just to name some perks."
good,"I was involved with verification and validation of Intel consumer electronic products in a laboratory setting and had the opportunity to work on cutting edge technical projects, solve challenging problems and meet some great people. It was a very rewarding experience."
good,"Overall Satisfied, Good work culture, Not much fast paced. "
good,"Nice people ,good work,if a little repetitive.mostly good .follow the many rules and youll be fine."
good,"Intel is a great place to work if you have what it takes.  They have unmatched benefits that make the long hours worth it."
good,Had some experience to learn and utilize new skills and understand new things. I didnt mind the bunny suit and I got to learn osha and what was reqquired in this area and enviroment as far as whats expected and how to properly handle expensive material being transported in and out of every place in the clean room.
good,"Enjoyed working there. However, FT employees keep their distance from contractors, don't expect to build relationships as you are excluded from any team or company functions."
good,"Fast paced environment, with multiple efficiency and delivery requirments.  Management needs lots of improvement. Hardest part is dealing with management. Most enjoyable part is the pay."
good,"I enjoyed working there. People were nice, and they followed labor law so i always had all my breaks. I could only complain about not advancing as quickly as I wanted and the work location being far."
good,"Overall Intel has good culture, though it is still very much a corporate culture.  You will get along with most of your co-workers.  Good communication is an essential skill.  The basic's things you learn in your engineering degree are important, but most important is your ability to adapt and learn new stuff.  Typical work week will be 50-60 hours, though there will certainly be 'rush' periods when that increases.  Intel has good training for manager, though how effectively your own manager will apply that training will very widely."
good,This company had a great working environment. There was a collaborative team with supportive management. Movement or stretching periodically was encouraged.
good,There have been a lot of re-organization which has produced a lot of flux.  I have meet and worked with many smart and awesome people.  There are corporate sponsored events and community service drives.      Slow to adopt new technologies though a lot can be attributed to lack of direction because of repeated re-organizations
good,"GPTW, but you need to get use to the area, having family members near or with you, have a love for the outdoors, be able to deal with long hours and walk long distances or standing for long periods of times."
good,It was an interesting place to work and learn new things. Gained alot of knowledge and information while working there. Along with new work experiences.
good,"This will depend on the group can be great or bad, it can be an engaging work place but a there is also many re-organizations of groups at times, sometimes management don't make the best decisions"
good,"Always worked around the demanding technologies"
good,"Generell ein Arbeitgeber, den man bedenkenlos weiter empfehlen kann. Vor allem das Gehalt ist hier gut. Das Unternehmen besteht aus vielen einzelnen Units und hier könnte die interne Kommunikation verbessert werden. "
good,"I worked as an Engineering Tec and then a process Engineer. It was one of the best places I've ever work. Challenging at times, but was worth it and still miss it"
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Intel but you can't get around the market share. You can grow many skills but when they own 90% of the market, it is hard to truly say you were influencing sales."
good,"Great place to work for directly. They are hard on contractors. Sometimes it seems like there are only contractors working here."
good,"Plenty of things to learn. Upon learning, things will be stagnant as it will be a routine job."
good,"Good place to work, compensation was good and there are a lot of very brilliant people there.  Opportunities for advancement are limited unless you are a minority."
good,"Intel is a wonderful place to work. It is a culture, a way of life. You don't work at Intel, you live and breathe Intel. Like Google, or Microsoft. Intel has an incredible benefits package, and genuinely cares about all of its employees to the best of its ability as a worldwide corporation."
good,"A good place to work, but work/life balance is a struggle from time-to-time. Lots of weekend work depending on your group, but many opportunities to work remotely."
good,"High expectations and heavy workload of new engineers. Lot of things to learn about semiconductors, CPU, Chipset, IP design, Process technology etc. Has good diversity. Encourages employee rotation. Can do better on pay and RSUs"
good,"Intel is good place to work...if you aren't several tens of thousands of dollars in debt for degree you may or may not be using. The education requirements for a technician job is absurd, a high school grad could do the job just fine AND benefit from the education program. The benefits are great and management is decent."
good,"Great place to work, would go back quickly if my fab in NM ramped up production again. I did not enjoy my time working facilities in Hillsboro OR, however... fab job in Rio Rancho NM was awesome tho"
good,"Excellent place to work with professional & open culture, results driven organization."
good,"Great culture & environment. Excellent development opportunities and a high standard of work. A brand They have diversity & equal opportunity. The business is respectful of different personalities, cultures & working styles"
good,Intel is a big sea and one can get lots of opportunities to work here. It depends on the person and how he networks with people. There is a lot to be done here.
good,"A solid company that is still in the mist of change.  They went from a memory to processor company, and now seem to be moving back to a memory company.  And where do drones fit in?"
good,I enjoyed my time at Intel.  As a contractor I was given autonomy to write my own code and test it well.  The work could be demanding as my team was spread all over the globe.
good,"Great work environment.  Find a good manager and make them happy and you will do well."
good,"Every day at work is different, you never completely know what you're coming into. The work force is incredibly diverse, this forces you to talk to/learn from people that are from many different countries."
good,"It has many tools which one can learn to achieve the best results, good training programs. I have good leaders and good team members so that goals and objects can be achieved."
good,"Great place to grow and gain experience. Must be tech, analysis, and number crunching interested. Had an overall good experience but also felt the pay wasn't up to chemical industry standards."
good,"Intel offers you free medical,vision and dental Insurance."
good,"good company for technology development, career development, benefits, team work is good, mission needs to be more realistic, politics getting in the way"
good,Intel is a good place for higher PAY and benefits. But the planning and resource management is poor. People are assigned jobs randomly and one cannot have focus on a particular domain thus leading to unsatisfaction in the work environment.
good,"Intel is a fast, challenging environment with high expectations from management.  They offer a good benefit package and plenty of opportunities to learn and grow."
good,"typical day at work, what you learned, management, workplace culture, hardest part of the job, most enjoyable part of the job and etc and more of this stuff"
good,if your ready to be stressed an love that sort of thing this is the place for you. another thing if you love safety so much you cant do your job this is the place to be
good,Very fast paced environment but employees were treated very well when I worked there.  Downside was there was an expectation to work long hours which is hard to do if you value work/family balance.
good,"Company has changed a lot since I first started, but Intel provided great opportunities to grow skills, experience and to contribute, if you take the initiative."
good,"It's an interesting industry to work in. Intel is filled with A-type personalities so there's a lot of people wanting to do things their way and get all the credit, which creates a less-than-ideal environment to work in for those that aren't a-type."
good,"It's truly a great place to work with. Though the workload is at the higher side, the environment is very favorable and leaves you with a sense of accomplishment. The company provides ample opportunities in the area of semiconductor, cellular communications, and data centers"
good,"Intel holds high expectations for employees, but compensates fairly"
good,"It is the world's second largest and second highest valued semiconductor chip makers based on revenue after being overtaken by Samsung, and is the inventor of the x86 series of microprocessors, the processors found in most personal computers (PCs)."
good,"The teams are very competitive but the work is very interesting and you get to learn on a daily basis, The team work could be better and the interaction with managers could be improved too."
good,"Worked in the Technical Assistance Center (TAC)"
good,No good work related to development. Most of the work is in verification and validation. Hiring is also from local colleges from karnataka. Difficult to stay with that environment
good,Was a good place to work but felt pressured to take a separation package even though I had an extremely good work history.  Do not feel they care about their individual employees as they often boast.
good,"Good place to work.  Good benefits, good people to work with. Long shifts (12 hours) though.  I like having 3/4 days off per week.  I was able to choose day or graveyard shifts."
good,"Intel was a great company to work for.  Fab 17 sucked.  The management team did not adhere to the Intel culture.  Communication was guarded, upper management was defensive and deflective with information. The site was in a constant state of cost reduction. Upper management flat out lied to employees' specific questions during MUMs, BUMs and FUMs.  This was unfortunate given that other sites were a joy to work at.  Fab 17 shutdown in 2013-2014 and is now a design/development facility."
good,"The company is a great company to work at.  Unfortunately the manager I have is quite a challenge to work under. "
good,"A lot of bureaucracy, constant change in priorities."
good,This was a relatively secure job but I craved intellectual challenge. There was opportunity to get promoted but not much opportunity to get to a more challenging carreer setting.
good,"Worked at Intel for over 20 years.  1987-2007. It was fun to work on highly effective teams.You could speak directly to the""top"" management of your group. I worked with VP's on several occasions. "
good,"Overall Intel is a great place to work. It is very fast-paced there and you will work with some great, very smart, people. You will have a lot of autonomy there. You will have the opportunity to try and learn new things. It will help you grow as a person."
good,"Intel is a great company, has great benefits, and a lot of very smart people. For all of those reasons, Intel is a wonderful place. However, you have to be the right fit. I was used to work environments that were more open, fun, friendly. My personal tastes in the job culture and environment just didn't fit that space."
good,"Best idea Intel ever had was the Freelance Nation Program. this was basically an in house contractors group. the employees were determinant employees for Intel but would be contracted out to other Intel organizations to help complete tasks and deadlines. It was a hugely successful program, but due to the placement of Freelance Nation with in another org, we were cut."
good,"The workplace culture of Intel is very casual but the workload is highly intensive. It is the combination of the two which promotes camaraderie between all employees, truly making it a great place to work."
good,It was challenging experience for me. I worked on some important projects. Although I struggled with work-life balance but I enjoyed my relationships in intel.
good,"Intel would raise the bar every year on the expectations of your job performance.  If you do a great job in your current role, you get a satisfactory or better rating on your performance.  Do that same job the following year, and you get a below expectations or an improvement required rating.  This type of evaluation only works for a few years, unless you change job positions."
good,"As I mentioned the company keep changing no one can predict whats next, although overall its good place to work at..............................................."
good,A challenging role. I have learned DAX. The culture was mot bad.  Supervsior was great. I wish they considered permanent. role and contracts. Learning DAX was fun.
good,Good company to work were you can have good balance between work and family.
good,working from home allowed depending on position.  The opportunity is weak to grow due to reorgs every quarter.  Change is constant and security null for upward mobility.
good,"Generally a good experience working at Intel, and the majority of coworkers and friendly and relaxed. There are issues during fire drills and current cutbacks, which affects the overall mood and creates stress."
good,"As long as you are well and good, this place is best to learn. It will help you to develop your debugging skills. Exposure across different protocols."
good,"Very stable company with reasonably good money and perks."
good,"Very little Growth, Poor Salary"
good,The product and the work I did was good. It helped me gain knowledge and apply my skills as an intern. Being their only for 3 months as an intern it is hard to judge the entire company but I had a pleasant experience.
good,"Super intelligent people who missed the mobile revolution and now are on a slow moving ship.  Try as they might, it's a has been company that offers steady but not upwardly mobile opportunities."
good,12 hour on 4 on 3.  MT under manned I believe the are trying to do to much with to few technicians all about saving money the bottom lne is what matters
good,Es una empresa con un enfoque humano para poder realizar tus labores dia con dia
good,"In general Intel has been a good place to work.  My experiences are in corporate services. The work has been challenging at times, and different most days."
good,"Work is balanced but the inconsistencies and layoffs happening makes it very stressful. Good place to work, work/life balance is maintained well. Volunteering opportunities are fun."
good,"Typical day consists of communicating via email, attending meetings both face to face and mostly teleconferencing, completing action requests, research and development, building and developing procedures, creating and presenting PowerPoint presentations, hosting meetings, user and stakeholder support, etc."
good,"Used to be an exciting, energized, and fun place to work until recently."
good,Culture/Managemant changes in the last 5 years have impacted employee's company outlook. The first 15 years or so were a positive work environment.Product development opportunities are still a very positive offering with Intel
good,"El trabajo fue en la modalidad de home-office y debía visitar clientes de mi ciudad y de otras ciudades de la costa y austro ecuatoriano."
good,good place to work. Lots of things to learn. Great team environment. The hours were good a little long but it was worth it for the time off you recieved.
good,"overall work/life well balance, depending on your job and your manager though."
good,Intel is a constantly changing and growing company. Great benefits and compensation while hours are tough. Great managers who are very dedicated. There is a lot of movement in teams because of the fast-paced environment.
good,"This was a fantastic place to work when I moved down here from PA. I really enjoyed doing equipment startups and optimizing equipment to get its best performance. It was very demanding and I would do it all over again. It was unfortunate that we did not ""win"" the latest and greatest process because the amount of property we had was too small for the new mega-fabs. Really enjoyed working and training other junior technicians and doing loop tuning on our SCADA system."
good,"The company culture is top notch - does not get any better."
good,it's a great place to work. But the job i was into didn't give me much exposure.The work life balance is good and the salary i receive is not sufficient.
good,"I worked for Intel for 20 years, and most of it as very positive. Unfortunately, work/life balance, which had been one of the best, has been diminishing the last couple of years. Unhappy with the CEO decisions. Left the company rather than relocate for the 2nd time in 2 years after several rounds of site closures."
good,"Strives for continuous improvement, leadership, quality and results. The company's total compensation is attractive. Culture has shifted slightly in employee loyalty."
good,Overall a good company to work with and gain knowledge since Intel is a fast growing company and leading a head of the technology and well known in the market.
good,Intel is a great place to start your career.  Plenty of development opportunities.  Intel has improved the buildings and work areas for most employees WW.
good,"Great team culture, fast-paced and challenging environment, but great pay & benefits. Great strides for making it a great place to work. Great gym, on-site doctors, and perks (lottery to win tickets for local events)."
good,"Intel offers it's employees some amazing benefits that make it hard to work anywhere else. As with most large companies, it is hard to be seen as more than just a 'head': the organization will move you to a group where they need to fill a gap, even if that isn't your interest or skill set. Personally, I have found that to be a challenge with my personal career development goals."
good,Intel is a good company to work for.  I think the CEO has a great vision for the company.  I think as long as you are located at one of the core sites then their is tremendous opportunity for growth.
good,"I have been working more at offsite location"
good,"We provided a managed service to Intel over a ten+ year contract. The jobs were generally stable with rotation from one project to another, unfortunately the customer opportunities got to be a bit thin."
good,"Intel great place to work, very big org, good conditions all employee in general. "
good,"It was good to learn new thinks as my senior are very supporting and good to share there knowledge with new team member like me :)."
good,"In 2014, the company started laying off large amounts of employees after naming a new CEO. These lay offs affected all jobs: Management, Engineering, Supervision and Especially Technicians.  I have a few previous co-workers/friends still there and according to them, the work environment is horrible and extremely stressful. Would not recommend employment there at this time."
good,"High intensity company with lots of opportunities to learn.  With that said, an understanding of work life balance built into the culture.  Community volunteering is emphasized.  Meritocracy is based on individual accomplishments over team based accomplishments which can drive the wrong behavior at times.  Overall, it's a great company to work for."
good,"Contingent contract to build and troubleshoot complex server systems at low level: processors, memory, boards, drivers, cabling, chassis, etc. Install BIOS and CMOS chips and customize driver software options. Installation and configuration of O/S and application software for Windows and Linux systems: kernel configuration, troubleshoot boot and runtime issues; setup and configuration of networking and peripherals (RAID6 mass-storage units); backup and recovery with TAR and CRON. Windows Server 2016, & Windows 10 Enterprise; Redhat 7.2; Ubuntu 14.02; Samba; OpenStack. Operate monitoring equipment like power meters, scopes, logic analyzers."
good,"I enjoyed my Job at Intel.  I worked for a hardware development team that had most of the team located in Israel."
good,"Intel is a good place to work, in general. We have good benefits and a good working culture."
good,"Overall the culture of Intel and the people were amazing.  I had a lot of opportunities to grow and learn new skills, and manage work/life balance.  However, sometimes evening meetings working across geographies was not good...and most recently there is a lack of trust with leadership and no feeling of job security.  They didn't treat people well in their recent layoffs."
good,"-Module improvement"
good,The Intel Comp Value their employees.  I enjoy the free fruits and beverages.  I enjoyed the opportunity to work overseas.  The Intel Culture is different than any other place I worked.
good,"The company is constantly evolving to meet current challenging tech environment, and is trying to remain on the cutting edge of the technological curve."
good,"Great compensation especially after a few years of service, work life balance is great because of the time flexibility (needed if working with mutltiple geos)"
good,"Good, constructive environment. Encouraged attention to work quality. I have learned new technologies and methodologies (Agile/Scrum and others). Hardest part was working/supporting multiple projects/systems at once. Most enjoyable part - constructive and friendly colleagues and generally helpful management."
good,"Intel is near and very dear to my heart. Such a wonderful history and great, great people."
good,Good place to work in a nice environment. There are some rules that not let some employees keep their jobs but in general is a good place to work. The benefit are the best and also the buildings with a nice cafeteria and other facilities
good,"Intel expects their emplyees to take on challenges and succeed in solving problems.  They encourage, support, and promote thinking outside the box.  The advancement opportunities are limitless."
good,"best work best result. when do better work with company that can best of feedback you can earn "
good,Work times depend on which site you work at.. for manufacturing techs it's generally a 12 hour shift (compressed 3 on/3 off 4 on 4 off) generally not a lot of additional overtime unless you want it.. work schedule makes it easy to spend time with family.
good,"Working with success oriented people is very positive.  I learned that need to keep evolving or changing to make yourself relevant.  The management does its job, keeps the machine working.  I enjoyed working with my coworkers, we all have a common goal and work together well to achieve that goal.  Hardest part of the job was determining the correct goal of the shift and achieving that goal, typically too many cooks in the kitchen.  The most enjoyable part was knowing that the decisions I made positively affected my module."
good,"Intel is a good company with many benefits. but as you get older and older, its becomes tougher and tougher to keep youre job. managers tend to be a hit or miss. so if youre manager sucks, well youre screwed. but otherwise if you do your job and do it correctly. youlld have no problem at this company. "
good,Very good work life balance but this depends on which group you are working with. Access to all the tools to improve your skills. Downside is very frequent org changes that keeps changing the priorities and is very agile which sometimes could put people under pressure.
good,I learned a lot in my 20 years at Intel.  So I can say that I would not be the man I am today with the skills i have today without Intel.  They are a good company to work for.
good,"Work in challenging projects executed in parallel. Able to learn ASIC design flow, from pre-silicon design to post-silicon. Has little time for self-improvement. Average to initiative attitude co-workers."
good,Intel's work culture good and the management motivates employees to have work life balance. However due to recent market conditions uncertainty in job security is making company unreliable.
good,"I was neck deep in work for almost 16 hours every day. And there were some bunch of people around me who worked max a couple of hours a day. Appraisals dont account relative work or impact. It accounts for manager impressions. Many good parts in culture, many just better ignored."
good,Good company.  Fort Collins is excellent place to work.  Intel Corp doing a bit of thrashing right now.  Downsize was painful to me and to the company.
good,Challenging work. Many opportunities to work on different areas. Clear communication from management about different projects and what is going on in the industry at large
good,"I worked at Tektronix for 32 yrs, my most enjoyable I live 2 miles from Tektronix, great management, very organize work process which helped me to delivery a good quality of my work.  Love it, and wish to go back there on my heart bit...."
good,"Great company, with good pay & benefits.."
good,Good pay and benefits. Work is hard and intensive at times.Sometimes the focus of some people get foggy and the team will suffer. Teamwork for the most part is good.
good,"Days run the full spectrum from slow and almost boring that you are searching information repositories to expand your knowledge base to being so busy that you wonder where the last 10 hours went. Typically, for the support work that I performed, it was execute to plan, bring in additional resources that may be needed, perform needed maintenance, research future needs and create plan."
good,"When we were busy we were really busy, but I liked the fast pace environment. I liked the community volunteer involvement we did. Working from home was also available as long as you do not abuse it. My manager was not a micromanager and I liked that. He trusted me and knew I would go out of my way to make sure the job was done right. This was also noticed in my yearly reviews. Intel is a great place to work.  Unfortunately the plant I worked at (Hudson, Ma) was closed down."
good,Work life balance. Nice benefits and good work place provided by company but job security not stable. Due to demand of cost reduction
good,"Intel does try to grow and make improvements, overall its a great company with many opportunities."
good,"Good company to work for, and it has got better in treating its employees. Always working to be way ahead of the competition which worked in the microprocessor driven computing area. They have come up short in the mobile world and now grabbing on to any technological hope that will salvage the mobile disaster."
good,"Setting up computers for testing in lab stations why'll performing inventory maintenance for organization of tools, equipment, & utilization."
good,"Intel has been good to me, I have made a lot of friends and have worked with some extraordinary people. It is a very large company and is in the business of making money so sometimes it forgets about the little people that work there. Overall I would continue to work for Intel if they where not closing our site down."
good,"Fun, flexible schedule.  A lot of room to grow but Politics may hold you back.  Competitive environment.  Hard works are not properly reward."
good,"Awesome place to work. Big on training. Big on culture. Odd hours equal big pay, normal work hours equal lesser. Big on employee involvement. Work Life balance is at the bottom of the see saw."
good,"Complete workout Gym"
good,"A typical work day included supporting various engineering groups in  different labs. Assignment were predefined but sometime dynamic:  validation tests, fixture configurations, updating and programming components (F/W, BIOS, etc) disk imaging, thermal evaluations, for  individual engineers kept majority of daily activities/ tasks  interestingly fresh and dynamic."
good,"They have all the usual perks associated with tech companies.  The people are great.  Large bureaucratic organization - slow to make progress, has to make large investments to 'move the needle'."
good,"Competitive place and need to work with people with different personalities.Can get toxic if managers are not happy.During peak season, work can deprive you of a personal life"
good,"Technically challenging environment with ample problems to solve.  Generally a good place to work but pace and commitment can be taxing on personal life.  The company compensates with reasonable work life balance policies.   At times, old company habits persist and inhibit innovative ideas.  Personal growth requires flexibility for internal transition and site relocation."
good,"With tens of thousands of employees, Intel has unique and similar distinctions to other high tech companies of its size and long term success.On one hand you can be at the forefront of technology only to be frustrating slow to implement changes due to red tapes."
good,"Raffled off free sporting event tickets, management lets you focus on your work and work/life balance. Great coworkers who are friendly and committed"
good,"My typical day at working is in production floor, dealing with machines issue and interacting with different kind of group of people from different hierarchy."
good,"Intel is trying to change from a PC CPU company to the next big thing. As we figure this out, the re-orgs are fast and furious, and middle managers may not be the best managers, but the best survivors. The best thing about Intel is the people you find as you move around the company; be sure to cultivate the productive relationships, you will need it."
good,"MDO product development in Hudson, MA, was a good place to work  until it was closed.  A good team with good management created a nice work environment.  Critical mass at the site is being lost as job functions are removed."
good,I am glad that I had opportunity to work with this company. The companies culture is very open and friendly. People from early ages to middle age all can gel well with companies culture and policies
good,"Many meetings to synch large teams, communicate cross site managers of progress, review requirements, design, code, test plans, quarterly progress and other responsibilities. Attended classes on multiple programming language and technologies. Worked on project from various geographic locations which worked on various technologies. Alternative job roles were recommended by management."
good,There is no such thing as a typical day.  Everyday starts with continuing projects and any break/fix issues. I have learned so much and everyday brings a new challenge.  I love the team I work with and management allows us the freedom to excel.
good,I had a great experience at Intel Labs. I felt that the company treated its employees with respect. One of the most enjoyable aspects was the ability to work on multiple projects at once and the availability of middle managers for one on one meetings.
good,"First few years were wonderful. Training was top notch and management attitude was one of supporting and advancing employees.  The last three years were ones where the company made false charges against many employees.  The company used false charges to get rid of me, but got caught making false accusations and had to withdraw charges against me.  A year later the company came up with new charges and forced me to take a buyout or nothing.  I took the buyout as did many others.  I would not recommend Intel as an employer unless the company has changed back to a people oriented company, which I very much doubt from reports I've gotten."
good,Intel is a good company for benefits and compensation.   It is a very intense work environment and takes work to maintain a work life balance.  There is lots of opportunity for advancement with mentor programs and many different groups / division.  Remember that you the employee own your career.
good,"I joined Intel on the down side of the Dot.COM era; The hours and duties fit my lifestyle. They gave me the means to travel, learn and help people in three continents."
good,"meetings with counterparts in other regions; some might be scheduled during late evenings or early mornings (depending on the country) "
good,I enjoyed this job. I did wet etch process. I worked on robotics maintenance and enjoyed my co workers. I did work nightshift.
good,It was a great place to work. Encourage Team work ethics and made sure folks had a great work / life. Rewarded for hard work concept which was awesome.
good,"Job is to protect Intel from patent law suits."
good,"They value their employees. I've seen layoffs in the tech industry from many sides. I've never seen Intel treat workers poorly in this regard. In my experience, if they cut your division, you will have ample opportunity to move to another division, or they will give you a generous severance."
good,"Always busy at work. Learned how to multi task, meet deadlines"
good,"Typical day:"
good,"Working for Intel provided challenges daily and there was always more to learn.I reviewed data and trends throughout the work day to make sure our systems ran to specifications. When things needed to be replaced, or maintained, we would go into the field and do so. The balance between work at the desk and in the field as a technician was also nice."
good,"Intel is a good place for people with family and those who seek work-life balance. However, it is not a good place for young engineer to grow career and gain skills as each position is highly specialized and have little exposure outside the specific work area."
good,"A typical day at work involved performing maintenance defect analysis and trouble shooting. I have learned a lot about semiconductor manufacturing process. Management is well organized,  Co-workers are usually well informed and have a wealth of knowledge to share. The hardest part of the job walking form one end of the factory to the other to respond to different tool issues and maintenance requests. most enjoyable and work/life flexibility."
good,"You are expected to work hard, but are also provided great pay and benefits.  As a large employer, mobility is somewhat rigid; however the culture is very dynamic. People are great to work with."
good,"Very happy with IntelExpress as they gave me very much."
good,"More job opportunities for technical employees that for the non-technical ones"
good,"Work about 7~10 hours per day, depend on project statues."
good,"Intel is a great place to work. Work is very time consuming and break time is very limited when available. Intel provides great pay, benefits, and time off."
good,"great company with great benefits and work schedule. Shift work, alternating 3/4 day work weeks 12 hours shifts. very comfortable work environment, "
good,"Awesome internship program, the staff is fun to work with, the expectation is high."
good,"Great place to work.  Only problem I have is the obvious disconnect between ""blue badges"" and ""green badges"""
good,"As an intern, I was lucky to have Intel be my first experience of a professional environment. The group I worked with opened my mind to what a smart, hard working, friendly collection of people is capable of. By far the most enjoyable part of the job was the great people who work there. "
good,"Company provides Good Work life balance to their employees."
good,Intel will challenge your work skills.  There are always new technologies to learn and debug
good,Their are a lot of superficial benefits. The greatest stresser I've had to deal with personally is the constant worry the job would go away at any time..... (for the last 15 yrs)
good,"A typical day at Intel almost always includes a meeting. Intel believes that if you know where you stand in the ""big picture"" that you will have more job satisfaction and therefore be more productive. I believe that there are managers that do not follow Intel culture which makes for an uninviting work environment. Otherwise managers are easy to work with and communicate with. For the most part my co-workers were of the highest caliber. That's one of the reasons Intel is number 1 chip manufacturer. The hardest part of a mask designer's job is to find opportunities for advancement. If you do not have a job-specific degree, you will not be eligible for advancement. When I had hired on 14 years ago, this was not the case and this proved to be the case for a while. Then Intel reverted back to being ""degree centric"" again. The most enjoyable part of being a mask designer at Intel is that you can transfer to multiple departments at one site or transfer to multiple sites around the world. You will work on cutting edge technology. Every two years you learn a new process, new designs and new tools. This proved to be very challenging and exciting."
good,"Resolve issues from the projects, write scripts to automate the flow, get ECO toolsync release, regression done, new tool/flow tests, close tool tickets. "
good,It was good working in this company especially interaction with clients.
good,"A fast-paced environment with various responsibilities requiring critical time management, strong attention to detail and superior multitasking abilities."
good,"A 3rd party internship is a good way to get in the door and see how business groups operate day to day. Job tasks are not very complex, or ground breaking for an undergraduate. A lot of data entry, and admin. duties that otherwise take time away from full-time employees. Not at the level of an Intel sponsored internship, but well worth the experience."
good,"Maintenance on Ebara and DNS."
good,"Estressante."
good,"On a typical day, I would check in at 8-9 am, and work in the cubicle or lab doing excel spreadsheet calculations and ms powerpoint presentations."
good,"Flexible hours and laptops make it easy to work from anywhere. Co-workers are motivated intelligent people. Your success or failure is tied directly to your manager, it is important to maintain a good relationship with them."
good,I worked in the Data Control Department. Engineers would come to my department to check out procedures. I ran reports and kept track of procedures checked out. I looked up information for my Customers at Intel. I bound books for classes being taught.
good,"all about si manufacturing, 0 innovation."
good,it was fun helping kids learn how to use programs and providing a good place for them to explore wat there talents musically and otherwise.
good,"Planning, Co-ordination and communication with continous learning"
good,"Intel is a great place to start off a career. Relocation, stock purchase plan, maternity/paternity leave and top salaries are great incentives. However, after several years outperforming, young talent can get stuck in the same role, needing to change job scopes completely in order to move up. This is true especially at higher job grades."
good,"qui trình công việc chuyên nghiệp, môi trường hiện đại, thoải mái."
good,"Ive had a great time so far at Intel. Recently I was panned to a new GL (Group Lead) This transition has been horrible. She is a terrible leader and does not care about her team members. She is impossible to contact but when she contacts you, you'd better answer."
good,I really don't have much to comment this is a great journey so far beside as everywhere you can work there's always those people who never like some new fox to succeed but that is part of the road as long as you care you will be fine.
good,"Excelente empresa para el desarrollo de la habilidades de comunicación e interacción social, con grandes oportunidades de crecimiento."
good,I know what is expected of me after going through with  daily pass-down. I communicate with the rest of my team to confirm that there are no unexpected issues. I prepare the days work planning the execution.
good,"Buena experiencia y ambiente agradable "
good,"So far so good.  I have not been with the company long yet the company has a lot to offer."
good,It is a great company with numerous opportunities to grow your skills and career. Find mentors and sponsors early on. Leverage opportunities in multiple business units. It is NOT just a hardware company.
good,"I don't want to be writing this review. Why are you forcing me to write this review? this is stupid."
good,"Usual problems are compensation, management and older mindset of most people. Not many like to change the existing process or challenge industry. Work life balance is pretty good."
good,"I worked at Intel right after graduating from college. They really do try to take care of you. I was paid fairly and their benefits were really great. My manager was also a huge pro to this job. I left because of the compressed work week, and because I wanted to pursue a different career path. If I could get a normal 9-5 at Intel, I would take it in a heart beat."
good,"Past pace environment,"
good,"The pay and benefits are phenomenal, especially considering for a lot of positions you only need an associates degree.  The work itself can be monotonous.  If all you want out of work is great benefits, and a great paycheck, Intel is for you."
good,"Lots of very smart people. Very competitive environment. Lots of ""diversity"", for better and worse. Management has changed since I've been there, probably for the best and the stock price shows."
good,I worked remote from the rest of my group. It required me to be a self-starter which fit me perfectly. Intel was always providing company-wide celebrations and events to bring people together. The hardest part of the job was trying to get information needed in a timely manner due to the location and time zone disconnects.
good,Great place to work. Encourage learning and development.
good,"great work schedule, 12 hour shifts 3 days one week and 4 days the next, Work is constant and keeps you busy,  Culture is mostly good, but it was always hard to know where you stood during the annual review process."
good,"I learned a great deal at Intel. A typical day started with breakfast in the on site cafe. Design work and meetings until lunch. After lunch was more design work, customer support and meetings until soda break with associates. After break, finish design work and get ready to go home."
good,"Learnt a lot! People are great and the backbone of the innovation at Intel. Management could be better, but in a fast paced industry, some flaws are expected."
good,Intel is a great company to work with and it has so many areas where you can build your career path. l work performed inside of the engineering  building. A place with great culture where everyone is a owner instead of just an employee.
good,great place to work. good compensation.stock is doing well. well known. fortune 100. work and life well balanced. free drinks and fruits.tend to reorg a lot.
good,"It is an entire culture to get used to.  Fairly flexible, but they also expect a lot out of you.  Big company environment, has lost some of the smaller company feel over the last 20 years, even though it was big back then."
good,"Great healthcare, sabbatical, onsite gym and wellness team."
good,"Working in the fab is a fairly unique experience, even aside from the obvious differences (i.e. wearing a bunny suit at work).  Intel pays well, and the benefits are second-to-none.  That said, they require employees who can:"
good,Interesting and hard work with constant pressure to meet market windows.  Great opportunity to learn and increase skills.  Lateral movement quite easy.  Upward movement based on merit is fair and for the most part un-biased.
good,company has good benefits.. but it is busy most of the time in the factory. There is alot of pressure to perform but that is commensurate with the high level of pay
good,"great place with lots of diversity. work as a contracted employee"
good,"Great place to work.  Benefits, pride of brand, pay, etc.  "
good,I can work through my sincere and efficiently. And  i am interest to work through by an part time job and i can manage my time to work as an part time jibs through over here.
good,"Life at intel is no life, Too much politic and high pressure. Learn curve is good but no life balance. Sky is the limit, you can learn alot from Intel, gaining good experience but is it worth"
good,"Intel provides excellent benefits and competitive pay. Lots of opportunities to learn and experience work with limited qualifications. "
good,"The job was easy to do, but also monotonous. Twelve hour shifts aren't bad, since it gives you three or four days off a week depending on if it is a long or sort week."
good,"Intel is a competive. Fun place to work."
good,"Very nice colleagues and partners and always nice to come to the office."
good,"Great opportunity to work on substantial projects with real impact. Be prepared to encounter employees who are lifelong barnacles that know how to play the internal political game, even though they add no real value.  Competition for advancement is fierce and the selection process can be hyper-political. It helps tremendously to know what your division is up to, what the products are, and what is happening with the industry overall. It's a great experience to work here, but don't expect it to last until retirement."
good,"Part of my early work was on shift, 6 PM to 6 AM. Later I was on a regular work week, if there such a thing. I mentioned their punitive work culture.  I found the people/technicians I worked with and around were always afraid of making a mistake and being ""walked out"".  This in my opinion greatly reduced their performance and job performance. It was disheartening to see."
good,Intel was a great place to work. I would recommend others to work there and would gladly accept a job if there if it was a right fit. I had excellent work-life balance and all my managers were great.
good,"Admin Assistants are expected to be Jack of all Trades - calendar management, typing, scheduling meetings,  making travel arrangements, dealing with customers (internal and external), work closely with executive level admins managers, etc.."
good,Smart people is what counts at Intel. No job is secure any more but jobs are not secure anymore no matter what level of contribution one makes.  Job work/life balance is demanded but employee can manage that. Hard working culture that demands results.
good,"I liked my job, it could be very stressful at times,but it was very satisfying. I would get a pass down from previous shift about priorities for the day. I would see my boss for about the first hour of the shift and unless I had any issues through out the day I would rarely see or talk to him again. I worked with Eng. department to work on priorities needing attention. I feel like Intel was my second family, I worked with many of my peers for close to 20 years.The hardest part was just the uncertainty of job security towards the end. Intel always had some kind of function or celebration for specific events or Holidays, some of which would include families."
good,I got to learn lots of new technologies that will help me in future jobs.  I got to learn OpenGL 1.X and Python working on real projects and products for delivery.
good,"Intel has been a great company for me to work for overall. I enjoyed the work/life balance, the compensation and benefits are competitive, and the job culture is adequate. For the most part, I have had good experiences with management, with a few hiccups."
good,Intel is a fast passed and cutting edge company that provides challenges and growth opportunities. They provide great benefits and flexible work environments to allow you to maximize your results.
good,Intel started doing lay offs more and more often where large groups of employees were walked out of the building.  This created a stressful environment
good,It was a laid back company . Make sure you do your work core correct and you can move up. They give you alot of purks with the job and it is a fun and ergonomic place.
good,"I am working at Bangalore location."
good,Fab Engineers have little to no work life balance. severe on-call schedules with punishing hours and work load. Not a friendly place for returning or new parents
good,"Good people to work with. Stress is there, but manageable."
good,"replacing new equipment which reduces labor and time, and also send some of old tools to china, lay off, contractors,volunteer early retirement/leave, etc...."
good,Works well with the core team members 10 - 12 engineers. Plus he focuses on Intel external customers too.  This helps promote teamwork for the whole group.
good,"Full Hours, Good Benefits."
good,"Flexible work time, a lot of opportunities for career training, good work balance, but the functionalities of each team might not be every clear. So complex project management can be improved."
good,"Flexible time for work life balance, you can work from home in case you need one. Your job always works on new technologies and products which keep put your experience in advanced position."
good,"I was always able to continue to learn and develop my skills and knowledge.  Intel provided opportunities to cross train in different areas, finance, engineering, planning etc to allow growth in your career"
good,"great place to work with lot of benefits. Lot of smart people to learn lot of interesting things. "
good,"Great Work/ Life balance for contractors and certain departments. Management is encouraging and understanding. It is a big company and it has its own flaws. Overall, people are very happy here."
good,Intel/McAfee is a fun place to work at. But they tend to always look for a cheaper replacement. So its not new for them to get work done elsewhere on the globe. That sucks because you may end up loosing your role to some one on the other side of the globe.
good,"Although there was a Work/Life Balance program, we would also say ""how do you spell Life?  Intel.  Working at Intel isn't just a job, it is a lifestyle that you commit to.  I loved it and it worked well for me.  If you commit your Life to Intel, you will be rewarded and promoted for doing so.  You will grow in your chosen field, they will help you achieve your goals and the benefits are great.  "
good,"served in various roles supporting multiple organizations within the company as a finance analyst, team lead, and then as a manager. The company is very successful and has an excellent rotation program to develop their finance organization."
good,"Pros:"
good,"Belle entreprise, beaucoup de moyen et force de frappe indéniable. Management (2000-2006) aurait pu être amélioré, beaucoup trop de culte de la personnalité des grands dirigeants américains, messages internes qui frisaient le lavage de cerveau, ce qui nuisait parfois au discernement et au bon sens, afin de créer des relations durables et de confiance avec les clients..."
good,"Intel Finance is a competitive but helpful environment. The teams are very high performing (for the most part) and are quick to join other teams to solve cross-organizational problems."
good,"While I was a contractor, I was on a New Devices Group team, and really enjoyed the culture and environment. Intel periodically tries to purge out excessive levels of contract employees, only to wind up hiring more, but if you get on one of the teams, it can be really fun."
good,Uma empresa que valoriza o trabalho feito e de longe uma ótima empresa
good,"Most of my design work at Intel was ""design by committee"". They had  very strict guild line and methodologies that where heavily enforced. Many design reviews."
good,"Working conditions are generally flexible, but management is not always adaptable to your needs. It's generally easy to get along with most of your colleagues, but the annual review process involves ranking you amongst your team members, which hinders collaboration."
good,"As an intern, I have learned a lot about software and hardware testing/validation and networking protocols. I have also developed great programming skills."
good,Safety first and reliable employee who pays attention to detail. Careful process therefore minimal scrap of product. Always a team player and always willing to assist in other departments.
good,"The last few years, Intel has been scrambling to re-invent itself as its primary market, PC / laptop processors has morphed with the rise of smart-phone use."
good,Intel - is a great place to work if you understand that you are going to get paid based on your performance.  For those that don't put in the effort will not be considered for continued employment or advancement.
good,"Fast pace office environment with high expectations of productivity,  Because of that the Health Centers and gym with various classes throughout the day are very beneficial."
good,"Overall Intel was a good place too work, but the biggest downside to working there was that it is a very large company which makes it a little more difficult to make changes or get things done.  They have great benefits and bonus plans."
good,"Embrace multi-cultural environment. Good place to work good benefits, and stock options but poor raises and salary compensation. Overall all my 20 years have been a good experience expect for the Big lay off in June of 2016."
good,"we start morning meeting. then we assign a task for each member "
good,Typical day depends on the organization you are part of and varies from relaxed to fast-paced environment. If you have the drive and a supportive manager and mentor you can achieve great things in the organization.
good,Intel is a good company to work for.  Can be stressful and intense  They pay well and provide good benefits.   You do work hard but are compensated well .  Good bonuses.
good,The 11 years there where the education I needed to be the best at what I do. If not for the politics and management fight to the get too the top. I could not say a bad word about the place.
good,I didn't work here long enough to develop an opinion and this survey is getting on my nerves. I really hope I am not expected to do a review on all of the companies I've worked for.
good,You can learn a lot about your job and there is never a dull moment. The best part of the job is going home. But some days I did feel like I had a sense of pride in knowing I was working on one of the most high tech operations around. I always felt close to my managers but not anyone that was not on my shift.
good,"Intel has been and will continue to be successful in its main industry, but struggles to find new areas of growth. The company is too slow when responding to the market, and does not do a good job of attractive young people. There is an absurd amount of bureaucracy, and they pay their engineers on the low end of the average."
good,Fuerte cultura de empresa. Grandes oportunidades de aprendizaje en un lider del sector
good,"Hard work but great  money.  Great coworkers.  Not always 8-5 as many folks work with other sites in other time zone around the world.  Sometimes too many meetings, depending on the role."
good,"A great company offers stock options, health benefits, yearly bonus and pay days off.  Very competitive, high stress job.     "
good,Intel is a Great Place to work with great benefits. If I were a long term employee i would still be there. I would recommend employment at Intel to anyone.
good,"I can honestly say I was proud, to work for this company.  We worked a flex schedule, the pay was decent compared to the cost of living, multiple bonus, unmatched educational benefits, discounts and perks are insane, and there's a huge family atmosphere amongst the work teams. Its even a company masseuse, and personal trainer onsite."
good,"intel was a great place to get my start.  I learned a lot there.  the benefits were good.  I met great people there. stock option were enticing, but fruitless"
good,Very fast paced and always something to work on.  Intel provides a lot of great benefits and Pay is also good.  12 hours shifts in a clean room fab environment.
good,"Intel provided a great place to work for me for 20 years. The culture is relatively laid back, but there is competition. "
good,"Pretty stressful at work since it's very fast paced and during critical project delivery time, working hours can reach 15-20 hrs a day."
good,A lot of new projects and exciting things to work on. Easy to change groups and try something new. Upper management was supportive of career growth and self improvement.
good,This company really has a strong culture of treating everyone equally. They have very strong rules against harassment in the work place with a strong emphasis on diversity.
good,Great place for work. Advanced Technology and opportunity for career development. Technicians and Engineers get certify by manager as part of their daily duties.
good,the company focus on people training and advancement. Nice environment to learn and growth. Excellent leadership! Very nice colleague and warm environment.
good,The pay is less than some but the culture is better than most and the work life balance is better so it is a bit of a trade off it depends on what you are looking for.
good,"I still love Intel and consider it the best company I have had the privilege to work for.  The culture is great, and the products are cutting edge, giving you a great sense of pride when you see your contributions publicly distributed and in the hands of friends and loved ones."
good,"The learning here is not that much, Environment is very cool begin a very big organisation it is very hard to get the impact so early and learning curve is not great"
good,"This job has moderate physical demands. Techs will average somewhere between 12000 steps and 22000 steps a shift. Some of the parts are both heavy and awkward to lift. However, these parts are 2 person lifts."
good,"Intel is a big company producing semi-conductor processors."
good,"Lack of visions and effective leadership from management, major conflicts between groups, weak technology strength at the new development, lack of confidence from individual contributors, in-health communications,"
good,"Los puestos de trabajo están siempre dotados de todos los materiales que requieren; cuenta con espacios agradables y cómodos para trabajar; las personas y la compañía son agradables, generan buen ambiente y confiabilidad."
good,"Troubleshooting, testing, and maintenance of systems."
good,"Intel is a good company. however, they are struggling with their re-org and management still does not have a handle on how to get the company going in the right direction. There is an insane amount of training that is non-stop. It was fun at first, but Intel is at the front of the technology curve, so be prepared for a never ending training cycle."
good,"Good place to work learn with many  professional people with  great experiences and skill.  Everyone is provided laptop, tools and supplies to complete your assign.    the working placed is clean and nice."
good,"- experience in manufacturing jobs"
good,"Company encourages employee growth, and consistently provides good technical challenges. In addition to fulfilling work, employees are very well taken care of."
good,"Working at this pleace, was one of the best professional  experiences where I ve have learned a lot form the system and people, I had to quit for medical reason unfortunately otherwise I ll provably stayed at this company ."
good,I work as Manufacturing Specialist at Die preparation I responsible to load program in my Machine.I worked with group of people with good bonding I learned latest manufacturing procesess.
good,Great compensation and benefits. There is systems in place to reward you for your effort and achievements. There are also great training opportunities.
good,"I would work for intel full time. My team was unfortunately unprepared for an intern (previously had massive layoffs) but I enjoyed what the company overall had prepared for interns (meet ups, networking events). I was paid quite well and eventually enjoyed the work I was given."
good,"I went through a robust training period before starting my job which prepared me fully to understand the culture at Intel and help me become a successful employee. I had several good mentors helping me to expand my areas of expertise and allow me to be recognized well at ranking and rating. The hardest part of my job was working 12 hour days, but we had 3 or 4 days off to enjoy time for our outside interests. The best parts of the job were being able to contribute to improvements of production of product and to streamline maintenance tasks to expedite tool recoveries."
good,"workplace culture has shifted dramatically the last few years for the worse. performance review process creates unhealthy competition and animosity between technicians. benefits, safety culture, training and work/life balance are well above the industry standards."
good,Intel is an amazing place to get to work in huge impact projects.  The people is really smart and the job is always challenging.  The proble is that the job culture isn't great and there is no real intention to change that.  Is a really busy job and there is no much time for other times but is great if you have great passion in what you do.
good,"You drive your career path and get what you put in. If you want a good work-life balance, you can do that and be successful, or if you want to put in a lot of extra hours, you'll be recognized."
good,"It's a different culture in the way they expect you to manage your work time. There isn't much feedback on performance throughout the quarters, but if you do your best at serving your customers it will be rewarded. In the 4 years I have been here I've worked hard to support my clients and as a result jumped 3 pay grades which also paralleled my compensation. Your expected to show results and you have to be diligent to seek out the most important ARs to work on. Free fruit and drinks for Blue Badge employees and lots of opportunity for training if you ask for it. The tech is fun and if you make the right connections you can be a part of many different areas, maker clubs , demo volunteers, community outreach programs ect..."
good,Intel has an excellent work culture. The best part id that they think a lot about their employees and hence I feel valued as an employee.  I also like the quality of work that I get to do here
good,"Intel has very smart people as employees which keeps the environment very healthy and it is a learning experiences. I learnt how to conduct research on latest technologies and how to dig deeper to find some innovation."
good,"In all but Silicon Valley, Intel will be the best employer in its location.  I think sometimes it gets in its own way, but there are really brilliant people there.  I have lost faith in the future to some degree.  I feel like the success of the company is coming from decisions made long ago, and no decisions being made now nor in the recent past are likely to bear much fruit."
good,"Great place to work and surrounded by the smartest people I've ever been around."
good,"Intel is going through some big changes as it grapples with a declining PC business and changing global markets. "
good,"A good place to work, may be sometime hard to get the complete picture and to gain the necessary knowledge. traveling and relocating  willingness are needed"
good,Great experience working here on assignment from Ireland for 12 months. Learned a lot about the manufacturing culture from an Intel site in the US. Co-workers are very friendly and willing to make sure I was a central part of the team.
good,"Compressed work week is the plus to this position. If you do not work a compressed work week your pay is reduced by 17% is on day shift if working night shift add another 16% decrease in pay. This contributes to not advancing within the company to a 5 day 8 hr position, possible 33% decrease in pay, locking workers into the factory."
good,"Great compensation and benefits. In normal times there is visible and tangible reward for your effort and achievements. Excellent job mobility and flexibility for work. "
good,A fairly standard corporate environment. With the decline of the PC they are facing difficult times. It is unlikely that they'll recover market leadership.
good,Learned a lot of things at Intel. Normal working hours without any overtime needed. Good experience for an intern. Many benefits for employees.
good,"Intel is a good company to work for, providing excellent benefits and being on the cutting edge of CPU and GPU architecture development.  While it has the typical issues of a large corporation like clumsy bureaucracy and lack of documentation on major business group organization, it is still a great place to work."
good,"Meet with shift change balance goals commit to a plan. I learned how to manage work skills, needs and priorities. Management was pressed to reorganize and maximize worker output and safety. Co-workers were split a bit possessive of knowledge and skills but worked well with each other. Best part was the introduction to new procedures, equipment and the continuous change."
good,"Great people and projects. Lots of opportunities to give and get feedback. Always striving to do the right thing, the first time. Has a culture of collaboration."
good,Great Place to Work. Above average benefits. Their hiring is cyclic with intense hiring and layoffs. My team was great to manage.
good,"Good place for work. Good environment. Good management."
good,Great place to work with great minds. People are very friendly.  Not many perks involved. Not easy to move between internal teams. Slow growth.
good,"Good benefit, dental and allowances. "
good,Intel was a fast paced environment that challenges you to drive success.  There are allot of smart and fun people working there and the work itself was great!  I really enjoyed my time at Intel!
good,Enjoyed my job at Intel. Always took bleeding edge and challenging projects. I was a mentor at Intel for 14 years that gave me a great experience to work with various individuals and teach performance testing and project management.
good,"Intel is a very nice place to work! Promotion is based on performance, not seniority. Advancement and path of career is huge. Diversity culture is great. My typical work day include benchmark testing, hardware and software installations. Troubleshooting problems, data collection and bugs reports. The challenges of my work environment is to have a learn fast attitude. New computer technology comes out every year. I enjoy bringing dedication, efficiency and customer orientation of my work everyday."
good,"No doubt that Intel products and technology are top notch but, the its traditional markets are sagging and there is an immediate need to find new markets for its silicon products.  The people and culture is good, there is always something new to learn, and hard work is appropriately rewarded."
good,"As all jobs, Intel is a very stressful place to work but they do pay well.  I have heard this said many times, they make logic but don't use. it.  With that said, they have room for improvement in that area when it comes to management."
good,Intel is a good company to work for. Expectation are high and this keeps you moving in a results orientation expectation. My position involves the creation of a next generation test systems for Intel.
good,I worked at Intel for 16 years and I always felt taken care of.  However it still a very large company and sometimes you feel like you are just a cog in the machine rather than a valued employee.
good,"Intel has been a blessing to my life and has offered me prosperity, opportunities and relationships beyond my expectations.  My co- workers are my closest friends, and highly talented at what they do.  Management has been hit and miss over the years.  First line managers are typically motivated and helpful.  Upper management is largely out of touch with day to day operations in my work group."
good,"I had a decent time there. My only complaint is that our engineering management was mostly comprised of reluctantly promoted engineers. They understood our technical obstacles, but were lacking in the soft-skill department."
good,"Constantes cursos presenciales y suficiente adquisición de conocimiento para siempre estar actualizados, se puede plantear como un buen ejemplo para poder ser un buen instructor y crear la formación de ideas para la mejora de cualquier actividad en relación como asesor en ventas incluyendo la creación de necesidades para los clientes por medio de los conocimientos tecnológicos impartidos, extendiendo la creatividad para enfocarlo en cualquier asistencia.  "
good,"Solid company,  For the size of INTEL they treat their employees very well.  I would highly recommend Intel as a good place to work."
good,"Flexible working hours, good Management, friendly environment to work. Coworkers are friendly and supportive.Place to learn many things."
good,"Great working environment. Good opportunities to advance. Bad managers do not last long there, great one flourish. Clean campus and good food in the cafeterias. Safe work environment."
good,"good company, good benefit for employee and need a balance on employee life, management a bit lousy, co workers are good, work a bit stress"
good,"Depending upon your position, your work may be tedious and repetitive or interesting and varied. I learned a great deal in each position I held within the company. There are lots of available classes to take to further your career. For the most part, your coworkers will be highly educated and intelligent. Your management may or may not be great ""people persons"" and everything is results oriented."
good,"Long, tedious days but rewarding work.  Good management and culture. Love the give backs to the community. Excellent place to get grounded in working in a multi-national company."
good,"Very great company with a lot of opportunity to grow and develop. The future of america depends on software security. The management is very selective, and chooses you based of 'if they like you or not."""
good,". Making sure all molding machine working smoothly."
good,"happy work here because, not to give much pressure. from here i learn many thing. l learn how to preventive maintenance, how to do report and many more.the hardest part is when the machine."
good,"It is a very good company with very good benefits,a lot of resources and possibilities. It will always depends how far you want to go, and what you will be able to give/achieve, opportunities are there for all employees."
good,Worked with great people. Liked supporting the engineers with graphics and software needs. Company required reviews were competitive and did not always support management and their individual strength or weakness. Company acquires and changes things fast. Fast past with opportunity to grow with the company.
good,"Overall, I really did love working here. The benefits are great and for a long time, the company was very flexible with work/life balance. However, as we moved into 2014 ish, those benefits were taken away and many people really felt the burden of the balance. They do still offer some great volunteer opportunities and try to keep moral as high as they can. The manager can really make or break the experience you have there. I got some really great experience though and met some really great people. Overall, it's a great company, especially for new to the market folks."
good,Overall a large growing company with many resources and support for your professional growth. However it has its own difficulties as found in any other company
good,"Intel was an always changing work environment that kept you on your toes. Weather it be in the factory working on projects and operations, meetings with management and coworkers, or just playing pool or conversations during your break time. Friendly work environment."
good,"A lot of new things to learn. There were classes provided by the company to learn new skills."
good,Overall great place to work. Great advancement for motivated individuals. Great work/life balance and benefits. Compensation could be better.
good,"Traveled and taught employees how to fill out Employment forms, processed relocations, processed payroll, Contact for Garnishments. Enjoyed my co-workers and what I did."
good,"-Great place to work"
good,It was a good job to work at Intel with strong validation team with expert developers. I enjoyed time to work even though I worked hard to meet deadlines. Have a lot of good friends and fun to work with.
good,"I like working at Intel, but it is very corporate.  Was treated well, but they do treat contractors more like second class citizens.  It is not a deal breaker and would work there again, just an observation."
good,it great operating all the lifts and trucks.   delivering parts into the passthru for the clean rooms.   you get a lot of exercise just walking around intel but its very easy to get lost in the sub fab but try to always think safety
good,Well developed methodology while limited scope of daily jobs. Good benefit and suitable for first job position. Main product group is relatively stable while new technology groups have frequently reorg.
good,"Quite a diverse portfolio of products being developed each year.  So you will always will have a something new to work on.  Team's norms seem to be consistent so expectations are fairly understood."
good,"Good Working environment."
good,"Except work life balance everything else was fine. "
good,"Regular monitoring and optimisation of tool and process performance."
good,Intel is a great place to work. It's been a great learning experience so far at Intel. It has helped me hone my technical and time management skills.
good,You get what you put into it but you have to manage not getting consumed by work.  The culture is good and creates a solid foundation of stability from organization to organization.
good,"Receive & pick up cargo shipment & make the invoice."
good,"Overall is a good company and well know company however, I’m looking for new changeling  in my life for my career development."
good,"Overall a great environment and very talented people. They have a wonderful work infrastructure and encourage risk taking."
good,Staffing is one of the place in the company where things are changing very quickly. Be prepared for the high volumes and great amount of work. You will collaborate with different stakeholders which in my opinion is very interesting part of the job.
good,A great company but not applicable to my current profession
good,"Like any organization, Intel is a collection of people with individual talents and capabilities.  Corporate culture is very results based.  Cyclic expansion followed by cost cutting."
good,"From the launch of the Intel Foundation in the last 1980's, the programs and funding have supported great causes and made an impact in the lives of many diverse students."
good,Overall a great place to work but not the most uplifting environment -- if you want stability and an environment with a lot of smart people and great technologies then Intel could be it; but if you want a friendly environment where people say hi in the halls and go to group events then Intel may not be the best option.
good,Typical day you start early leave late but leaving fulfilled. Most days are full of last second change.Never dull moment!!! One can be as involved or not in the day by day blow of a normal manufacturing facility. Once up to speed management expects independence. Working with others on a team is a plus as far as learning more and reducing stress. In short the only thing that stays the same is change.
good,"Nice benefits and pay. However, no sense of responsibility given to MT's."
good,"I worked here for 34 yrs, grew up only knowing Intel and their work culture. I loved every minute of it, but it was time for a change. I was a Failure Analysis Engineer at Intel and did mostly technical work. (quality control in a lab environment) I created and improved continuously our failure analysis process, by creating and improving wet and dry etchbacks, using chemicals and gases. Then using it on computer chips and or full wafers that manufacturing made, but not up to par, so I located the problems and try to improve yield. I also maintained all the supplies and equipment's. I handled all our administration tasks by ordering supplies, organizing lab and writing and training all new hires on safety and procedures."
good,"Good and fast paced, almost each day. I learned lots of technical things-- good formal technical training. "
good,"One of the things which impressed me so much, Intel corporate culture. Company is cultivate and really taking care about main rules of Intel employee behavior. It's create extremely comfortable and open mind environment for better performance. I seen many times how new hired staff joining the team recently, has been integrated so quick, even brings significant deliverables as individual contributors in first 3-6 months."
good,The job load is reasonable and the management is very good. The working environment is very comfortable and the office utility is flexible to fit anyone's need.
good,I was well paid as a full time employee and a great place to be employed the 8 years I was a blue badge. It is a concerning culture difference when you are employed as a contractor.
good,I was an intern for Intel. Everyone was really friendly and helpful. The management structure is pretty flat but there are a lot of lateral job movements that can be made.
good,I had a great using my educated background Degree at this job and learn a lot about safety at Intel.
good,"Focus on Work-life balance."
good,The work is great but you will be pushed hard to get it done quickly and with a minimal staff.
good,The pace was very fast at Intel. You start the day with a meeting about the tools that are trending and will be taken down for trouble-shooting. Then you make a schedule with your co-workers to best handle the day. the best part of work was the connection between my peers.
good,I worked for DDE as a Sub-Contractor for Intel. We installed the electrical branch circuits for Fab 32
good,"Typical day will consist of technical development and debug, technical meetings and interaction with engineers world-wide to solve difficult problems."
good,"I have enjoyed the 19 years that I worked at Intel.  They have given me the opportunity to excel with Intel University courses as well as has allowed me to travel around the world.  Even though they allow their employees to work from home, they expect at least 60 hours a week from their employees.  I have gotten use to working at this pace.  Due to the nature of a global company, it makes it next to impossible to work from 8:00-5:00.  The instability of their ""constant layoffs"" is not too healthy of an environment to work in.  However, that's all I know."
good,"Driven group of people. Sometimes too much overhead as an overall organization. Learned a lot about design considerations not normally considered in classroom settings. "
good,Love science and hard wired for the labs. I really enjoy being a tech with freedom to create processes for FIB and FA.
good,Each day different.   Set up many new procedures. Lots of teamwork and support to get tasks completed.
good,"New challenges everyday, not 2 days are ever the same."
good,"company's culture is very good...:)"
good,It is great pay but the upper management does not like to fight for the lower guys to much.
good,"Busy but enjoyable as was gaining experience in call centers"
good,I enjoyed my work and the work environment until the 12hour shifts started wearing on me.
good,Once your through the door it's heads down.  There's so much to do and enjoy while working through your day.  I like being busy and this position has provided that.  There's not a moment or situation I can't learn from here.
good,"In the 12 years I was there I would have to say never a dull moment managing all facets of purchasing for the company from chemicals, parts and employee lockers.  I learned a lot of different purchasing techniques.  My co-workers and management were always straight forward and professional.  The hardest part of the job I would say would be the constant changes that arose but were also some of the most enjoyable parts of the job ."
good,"Flexible work hours, great benefits. Open culture.Less red-tape.Supportive management.Risk taking and innovative mindset encouraged."
good,"I have worn many hats over my career at Intel. Mechanical lab technician, silicon wafer process technician, mechanical design engineer, structural analyst, project manager, engineering mentor, User Experience researcher, Failure Analysis engineer, and an assortment of brief assignments. This is a testament to the variety of opportunities at Intel. "
good,Intel is actually the safest company i have ever worked for. They value their employees safety.
good,"I spent 12 years onsite as a contractor, Vendor or Full employee. I made good friends and money. I learned a great deal about technology I would not have learned anywhere else. I wish I was still there."
good,"Very educational was a lot of information to take in and learn about the process that is done with inside the company, management worked hand and hand with engineers and technician's to ensure that the Company goal's were meet... Safety, Quality, and Output..."
good,Intel is a great place to work.  Working compressed work weeks is something to get used to.
good,"The nature of the work was essentially all or nothing. During busy stretches (end of quarter), the job got tough and 60 hour weeks were required. However during light times you could work from home and focus on other side projects. It always seemed to balance out in the end. When Intel doesn't need you, you have a lot of flexibility. When Intel needs you, they really need you."
good,Intel will pay you well if you do a good job. It is very bureaucratic though and it has a funny way of ranking and rating people.
good,Very organized intern program - managers and mentors know what to expect and how to incorporate interns. Compensation is good to average for the area. Projects vary but have the potential to be both challenging and important to the company.
good,"Excelente empresa. Muy bien manejada por su líder local, pero con muchos problemas para adaptarse al rápido crecimiento y extremadamente demandante. Excelentes prestaciones y salario. Viniendo de Hewlett Packard, se extraña el valor de confiar en la gente. Comparativamente, son bastante desconfiados para todo."
good,"I was able to take part in a 6 month internship with Intel in Hillsboro, OR and I had a blast. The pacific northwest is a beautiful part of the United States for it is always teaming with interesting people and events to attend all throughout the Portland area. As for the company itself, Intel is a very huge corporation and it is easy to get drowned out by all of the noise that is going on but for those who truly want to succeed horizontally or vertically Intel is the number on place to be."
good,Intel provides an interesting experience with lots of opportunities to improve ones skills and produce quality software. I learned a lot about working in a large network of engineers to collaborate on a software project for the company.
good,Well-developed corporate culture
good,I worked here for 7+ years in 3 countries. Always challenged. Got out because I was not growing fast enough (due to recession and what not).
good,Role : Telecom Order Management for Intel Technology Global Asia Region:
good,"While Intel like any other company has its flaws, bad apples, and challenges in reorienting its business to face a new competitive landscape, it was still a very positive experience. Since I've worked for startups since leaving Intel, not sure how it'd compare with other tech firms their size...but I still appreciate the emphasis Intel put on career development, management, and inclusion. Especially for those early in their career, it's a great experience."
good,"The work was fun and the environment was great, but the deadlines were consistently unrealistic and nobody seemed all that interested in fixing that or promptly communicating more realistic expectations to customers. Kind of frustrating."
good,"You're placed on a team and help with whatever tasks at hand. Different teams handle and use interns differently. Some are coffee jockeys, others aren't much different from full time employees."
good,"Productive environment with decent compensation, and access to current and developing technologies.  I would definitely work there again. (Specific to Hillsboro OR.)"
good,"Successful and a great team player."
good,"I enjoyed my work here. The food was great, the sheer number of people at the campus was fun because you see the same people over and over and start to get to know a lot of people."
good,"Diverse, large (always something to explore and learn) environment. Good sabbatical, pay, people, work-life balance, and true to the ""roger rabbit gets quality cds"" value mnemonic -- risk taking, rewarding, great place to work, quality, customer orientation, and disciplined execution."
good,It was a great place to work and learn. I got to work with lots of great people and talent. It was a great experience and I do not regret the 19 years I spent there.
good,"I've worked at Intel for about 4 months now as an MET and have mostly positive things to say about it.  Having been to some terrible jobs (including the miltiary) where you are treated with no consideration, there is a sense of comradery that sustains the culture at Intel quite well.  "
good,Intel provided many opportunity to engineer.  Allow engineer to be transferred between groups.  Intel university provided many trainings.  I like Intel free coffee...
good,"It's a highly demanding place to work, but flexible and rewarding. The opportunity for growth and development is amazing. Intel will invest in you so long as you provide a decent return on their investment."
good,It was an overall positive work experience at Intel. I eventually left because the required work schedules conflicted heavily with family obligations.
good,Has been a great place to grow and learn over the years. It is a very technical and engineering focused company that is driving great cultural improvements.
good,"Work life balance was good. It was a great working experience and learning. New innovation and ideas can be executed in a well processed manner, I love Intel."
good,"Excellent benefits, and surrounded by extremely smart people. Campuses are large, and one can easily get lost. Had executive shuffles these past few years, and with each new transition brings talk of layoffs and strategy changes."
good,"Great place to work, Management is easy to work with and helpful. The product is only getting better and leads the world in quality. Hours are the best part, nothing negative about this company, pay is also nothing to worry about."
good,"Good working environment, One Intel, and good management for success as a group. With a flexible time, as an employee, we have a lower level of stress and become more confident in completing the job."
good,"I spent nearly 15 years at Intel as QA and learned many things at job and from peers. The skills and quality of folks around made a difference in everyday work. The company culture leans towards conservative side but it is slowly evolving. Management often tend to do activities for sake of ticking boxes. Work life balance is all right. Rewards and recognitions are average. Intel being a very big company, it is difficult to get promotions and move up the ladder. Most important thing is not to wait for opportunity to come but have to work towards it."
good,"Depending which business group, sub-group and manager you have, your experience will differ greatly.  I was lucky enough to have 2 great managers, and to be part of a cohesive, productive team there for over 10 years.  As with any huge company, you are subject to changes, including job cuts. Compensation and benefits were great.  Expectations and accountability were very high.  Not an ""easy"" place to work, but if you work hard, build strong relationships, and do well, you can find many opportunities."
good,"Intel is good company to work . As they follow best ethics in the work environment . "
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working for Intel for more than 15 years."
good,High volume production environment with collaborative team work ethic. Self driven job under supervision guidance from managers and engineers. Intense training with fast learning curve expectations. Continue to learn new methods of manufacturing process for technology development.
good,Great place to work if want to be apart of something big.  Lots of different opportunities and groups to be involved in.  encourage school and career advancement
good,"Job Work/Life Balance: Depending on your department you working, the task-force/AR/skype mtg can be assigned by your leader, manager as urgency even EE have to attend mtg/perform SQ/IQ plan as factory demand but EE can take a leave compensation/OT :). "
good,"I enjoyed my career at Intel and have learned a lot from co-workers and challenging projects which exposed me to  a diversified skill sets from fab, board and system manufacturing; giving me perspectives from design, production."
good,Intel is a great place to work.  You need to be driven and very much a self-starter to advance.  There are great opportunities to move around the company and experience different areas of management.
good,"The work culture is very nice, It is flexible. the job doesn't rush. but manger look on your weekly report. you can take rest any time as loong your job have to be completed"
good,I have to type at least 150 characters here so Im trying to do this without saying anything  Intel was a great place to work and would do it again......
good,"Overall Intel was a very good place to work. The safety, quality and production standards are top of the line, with heavy emphasis on having the absolute highest levels of efficiency."
good,"Intel has a mantra of ""Great Place to Work."" While the company has undergone many changes over the last five to ten years, many of which have detracted from the autonomy and ingenuity engineering groups once enjoyed, it is still a very good company to work for. Their total compensation package is definitely among the best in the industry and they are the only tech company I know of that offers sabbaticals."
good,"Flexible time work and healthy work-life balance."
good,"Great management, very connected to the team. The team worked well together and focused on each individuals strengths. A fun place to work, very flexible working schedule and was able to work remotely whenever I needed it---very valuable for work-life balance."
good,"Good Place to work for if looking for good work life balance. "
good,I had various positions at Intel.strong expectations and very good culture to work in.  I traveled outside U.S. and helped improve productivity as well as teach technicians.  I also supported warehouses with returns.
good,Process Control Operations at Singulation Automated machines. Operate Laser Automated machines and perform Separation process reducing a wafer containing multiple identical integrated circuits to individual dies. Learning useful skills for semiconductor career path.
good,"Career advancement is only for full time employees; they hire a lot of contractors who will be stuck in the contract cycle. Other then that, it's a good place to work with a lot of smart and knowledgable people."
good,"Good company with great benefits. So big that different business groups have different cultures. Got tired of re-orgs. Great products, easy to move around the company."
good,"Intel was a great company. By being so BIG you can lose the finer things along the way. Intel forgot their tech's was the heartbeat of their company. Which is now they are looking to ramp up again and I was contacted but not interested. looking for something different."
good,"Loved working at Intel if they didnt close their Hudson Fab would still be there.  Great creative culture awesome people, Management was always willing to help"
good,"A very discipline company and strictly follow its culture and ethics. No tolerance for violation of its ethics whosoever it is."
good,"Great place to work, helping teams, good benefits make one to join Intel. Enjoyed career there as contractor as well as a full time employee. One shouldn't miss working for this great company."
good,Running monitors on AMAT tools  and running engineering plan  on AMA tools  / Metrology tools computer skills / working with a lot of different culture
good,"Intel is a great place to work.  Job security is a little stressful, benefits are great, there's never a dull moment and you always have something to do.  As with any major corporation, there's a lot of bureaucracy and it takes awhile to find the avenues you may need in a corporation this large."
good,Got to talk to several different employees around the world.I learned a lot of different things. It got difficult when some people got irrate if I was not able to assist them in the manner that they expected.
good,"Really good working environment."
good,"i learned i determined my own career development. "
good,"Whether you're a contractor or a regular full-time employee, you're treated pretty fair and there may be some perks you're not qualified for, but aside from that they don't exclude you on all company events and makes you feel like you belong."
good,Work life balance is good. It is very tough to get things done when it involves management approval. Lot of opportunity for entry level to grow but not for experience.
good,Good team atmosphere. Management was swamped though. Allowed people to explore in their job. Learned a lot from going off the beaten path. Management made good efforts to team build and connect people.
good,Loved working at Intel - was there 18 years and was big part of my life. Made great friends and had fulfilling work for most of my tenure. I was able to retire from Intel as well and reap a pension.
good,it was a great company. I enjoyed every second of it. I liked people team building activities where staff got to meet each other and build a  relationship
good,intel is a great place to work. Organized and customer oriented.You are free to work with confident because lot of trainings are given to their employees
good,Highly recommended to everybody. Great company culture and athmosphere. Very friendly management and employees. Company invests in employees. Hard to get a permanent job when you are a contractor.
good,"Great place to work, opportunity for everybody who work hard. Great benefits and profit sharing, but lack of career advancement opportunity, lack of training opportunity"
good,Great place to work that challenges your creativity and problem solving skills.  Opportunity for advancement for those who demonstrate leadership and integrity.
good,"Fun place, lively people. Great project and enjoyed the flexibility. Overall great experience even though it was for a short time. Great manager and people I worked with."
good,I loved having the opportunity to work for a major corp like intel. they have a vast number of different cultures from around the world that worked as a team.
good,"It's easy to get comfortable. Might be my job but Intel isnt as aggressive as other tech companies. Flexible under the right manager, but some people have nightmare jobs."
good,"The employees at intel are great people.  very intelligent and passionate.  The culture of a large corporation can be challenging at times with a lot of meetings and ongoing projects, but over all an exciting place to work."
good,"Great company and work environment. Motivational place for employees."
good,"Working at Intel, was a great experience, it was like working with family. we had good communication everyone knew there jobs and helped others that needed it."
good,"A lot of times you are multitasking with no help, but at times you can relax. The more efficient you are the less work you end up doing. You are accountable for your own work, get it done on time and there will be no problems."
good,"Worked for Intel from a remote location, the majority of my team was located in a different timezone, but never felt less than part of the team. The benefits and compensation were excellent."
good,"Very good company and benefits, there are many challenging projects and opportunities to learn new technologies.Benefits are excellent and HR is better than other places."
good,"Hired through acquisition, was very good experience.  "
good,"Very good company for anyone at any stage in their career. One of the biggest companies in the world means there's roles for people of all backgrounds, qualifications, and skill levels."
good,"I had done internship over there. Awesome place to work. People are good, knowledgeable, and helpful. If someone wants to learn, then its good place. Work culture is good."
good,Great place to work. Opportunities to work with the  Coolest and latest cutting edge technologies all the time. Great people and great work culture.  Love the open door policy
good,"I loved working here was just so far away and was only a temp job, if it was closer to my house I would love going back also it just happened to be a temp job so it didn’t last"
good,Learnt a lot during my time as an intern; Worked on new and upcoming technologies as well as built up knowledge about current software and technologies being used in the team
good,"Great benefits and shift pattern with lots of training opportunities. Work place is stressful and fast paced so being able to consolidate new skills can be difficult to achieve."
good,"Started here, they helped pay for school, had good benefits.  But they sold off our division so we all ended up working for a different company with less benefits, etc."
good,"Great training and employees performance review rated on merit."
good,"Great benefits, paid sabbatical.Many capable engineers willing to mentor if needed. Facilities are updated and well maintained. Great break rooms and work out rooms."
good,it was a really good job. I learned how to cook new things. I really enjoyed having a new culture experience with food and trying out various cuisine from other countries.
good,For the most part Intel is a very fast paced job and I enjoyed that. Do not like to be bored or sitting for long periods of time. My job was very manual and physical and I really miss that lifestyle. I felt accomplished when I would leave for the day.
good,"Very relaxed culture with good amount of work, but supporting and friendly management. Management is very much supportive and understands your requirements and concerns."
good,"Fast paced environment working with a lot of smart young people."
good,"A reasonable place to work."
good,"Depending upon what job you have at Intel, it can mean a great work life balance, especially if you're very efficient.  I could easily do two people's workload in 30-35 hours a week, spending 1 1/2-2 hours a day in the gym.  Unless something has changed, there are quarterly bonuses, which is a nice little chunk of change.  RSUs restricted stock units are given annually too, which, with raising 4 daughters, I cashed in each year to pay off credit built up for various purchases.  They have very efficient, streamlined processes that are typically the same no matter what site you work at and, if a process is not working properly, they are big on fixing it, using Lean Methodologies to identify the root cause(s).

I thought they were the best, but my opinion was tarnished when I found that they were found guilty of conspiring with other tech companies to keep wages low.

However, one day a week, I lead a staff training seminar on a variety of topics, ranging from effectively communication.

We all had thing in common and that made work fun because we would always talk about our hobbies and things we did the other day and we would give each other advice. The hardest part of the job I would have to say is when we got new reworks that we had to do on all the new boards and we had to get them up and running within a certain amount of time.

It was somewhat hectic work on the manufacturing floor with multi million dollars of product. You were always aware of making a mistake. The benefits were great. If your a team player there is plenty of that. Advancement was available to those who took interest. The company provided schooling everyday.

good,"I worked here eight years and it was mostly a good experience. I left for personal reasons mostly, although I took a lot of what I learned from Intel to every job I've had since. The meritocracy method of determining compensation increases encourages employee growth, but it totally neglects years of faithful service, so you are only as good an employee to them as the awesomeness you can perform in the four to six months before the review cycle. However, the pay and benefits are truly outstanding, as is the challenge of the job (I got to work on robots in the fab). Overall I'd recommend it, it's a good job to have if you have a family to feed."

Required all members to function as one and meet extremely precise deadlines usually counted by hours. Working on the equipment was the most enjoyable part of the job as there was always something new to learn.
good,"Intel as a whole is a really good company to work for. If you have a good manager and desire to progress you can really go places. However if you have a bad manager chances are pretty good you will go nowhere. The downside is many managers are far enough up 'the food chain' that you will go down before they will. Intel does provide a good working environment both inside and outside the office. If you are hired for a 40 hour work week, chances are pretty good you will be working more. Personally I regularly put time in at the office and because of the global nature of the work, also had many early morning and late night meetings so the work schedule needs to be adjusted as appropriate. It is great however to have the technical resources you need and the benefits are great."
good,Every product was opening up new innovations and it was always exciting to solve the challenges.
good,It's a well-managed company. Work load is well divided and assigned among engineers.
good,boss at altour was great
good,Developing engineering project. Leaned new things every day. Good team players at work. Learn new things needed but it is enyoyable
good,Not possible for such a huge company to be a great location for everyone.
good,"Participates in requirements analysis, development, integration, and testing of the IT Systems Monitoring."
good,good working environment
good,"Starting with a team meeting, then back into work with a set goal and priority in mind."
good,Busy day every day.
good,It is a great company with great benefits. As a Remote Operations Center Technician there are a lot of manufacturing processes to be aware of. Multitasking is a key part of my job.
good,"Engineering technician of gasonics asher, maintained , trouble shoot repair"
good,Employees worked as expected because it was such a great place to work. Most managers did not micro manage.
good,Fun place to work and excellent co-workers. The hardest part about the work it's the rotation that goes around.
good,"Encouraging, and learned a lot in sharepoint teechnology."
good,I enjoyed the people and work environment the was provided by this company.
good,Interesting and challenging culture. I enjoyed the opportunity to learn from and interact with brilliant people from a multitude of countries and cultures. Empowering to women and a good corporate neighbor supportive of volunteerism and communiity responsibility.
good,"nice workplace.it is an great experience to work at intel.lot of team activity."
good,I loved working at Intel. It was both challenging and fun. Employees are rewarded and recognized for their innovation and hard work. I highly recommend working there!
good,"I joined as an intern and transferred to a full time employee. You can learn a lot from working with many professionals, but you have to take the initiative to learn the skills you want. Sometimes, when there's too much flexibility or open-ness, you kind of get complacent with how you grow."
good,There are many opportunities to change career path and explore other fields.  Positions available at sites all around the country and world for that matter.
good,"Understand you may not be getting paid as much as you will somewhere else, but Intel truly stands by their employees. They are very much family orientated. I love the work outings."
good,"Very fast pace environment. Plan to react vs working your own agenda.  Work environment is very good, game rooms, barber shop, fitness ct. prayer rooms, etc on site."
good,"Great Place to Work - supportive management, a lot of great colleagues, encourages learning. Not always easy to move around departments, however depends on who you know in the company."
good,"It was a great great experience to be at Intel as an intern, they have great work life balance, wonderful work culture and very productive, supportive and collaborative team to work with."
good,"It is a large company and it can sometimes take time to locate the right person or group to communicate with when trying to solve problems. Not specifically Intel's fault, but part of the problem with a company so large."
good,"Definitely a good place to work. The culture is very relaxed, people there are competent and I learned a lot. Management is very hands-off and give people the freedom to breathe, yet are always available when needed. Lots of team events and just a generally friendly team environment."
good,Very relaxed workplace. Many learning and development opportunities for employees. Clear and understandable company strategy. Strong management and transparent policies.
good,"I have work at Intel for over 15 years. Overall a good company to work for.  As any large organization, it is a bit bureaucratic, but this should be expected."
good,"I worked as a Process Engineer on shift.  This meant 12 hour long shifts with alternating 3 and 4 day weeks.  The long weekends were a big bonus and part of why I stayed for so long.  There were plenty of on-site perks for the job: free coffee, soda and fruit down in the cafeteria.  A nice bonus every quarter if we hit production goals and an understanding management team."
good,"-Hours are set but flex with not overtime."
good,Very good training program. Facility was very nice and pack with friendly workers. Very helpful colleagues. Work here for a few months but enjoyable and good memory.
good,"If you want to work for a company that has done the same thing for a long time and really knows how to do it, Intel is the place to be.  Highly recommend."
good,"Working at Intel was my first real corporate position. It was an enjoyable position besides the idea that everything can and will be improved. This is one of the few negatives. Positively, it's a great place to improve your work ethic while working in a comfortable, laid back setting."
good,"Lot of things to learn about semiconductors, CPU, Chipset, IP design, Process technology etc. Has good diversity. Encourages employee rotation. Can do better on pay and RSUs"
good,"worked there for 17 years, loved it! great environment and worked with super great people, I would totally do it again and always keep a lookout for opportunity. its definitely an ""inside"" culture and maybe not for everyone, but it worked for me and I recommend it."
good,I've worked at Intel for 22 years. I have been afforded every opportunity to develop and advance my career and have been rewarded for personal and business unit successes.
good,"Intel encourages lateral and upward job moves within the company, making it a great place for long-term employment because as your job become stale or you are ready for a change, you don't have to leave the company."
good,Un día normal de trabajo es relajado y puedes salir a tomar un descanso si lo necesitas (ir por un café o algo así)
good,"A typical day at work for myself was working the night shift at the factory, usually inside of the clean room. We have a pass down twice a day, once coming on shift and once coming off shift with the day shift personnel. We are made aware of any testing or changes made during that time and make sure the on coming shift knows what has been done and what is remaining. I learned a lot about what goes into the production of microchips that Intel uses as well as how the process is managed from step to step. The culture at Intel is relaxed and pleasant, most of the people that you work with are great and none of the managers have offices, so if you need to meet with one of them, you can go to their cubicle and meet them. The hardest part of the job is two fold. One is to be sure to utilize the publications for all troubleshooting and maintenance procedures, even if it is something that you have done before. The second is the hours, a typical day is a 12-hour shift with 1 to 2 breaks for lunch and to stretch outside of the clean room. the most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that they do a lot to keep employee's happy. There are lounges, games, drawings, onsite medical and cafeteria's."
good,"Atmosphere is pretty lax, you definitely need to learn to work and be a self learner.  A lot of project management work.  The bonuses were amazing, the workplace culture was very diverse which pleased me."
good,"Intel has a unique culture in that you feel like family even though there are over 100,000 people world wide. You have the ability to take your career as far as you want to go. In fact, it is encouraged for employees to change jobs every 18-24 months to diversify their career at Intel and learn more about all areas of Intel. If you get a great manager, you can work together on accomplishing your goals for a work/life balance, taking classes at ASU, or even teaching classes held at Intel. The 4 week and 7 week sabbaticals are definitely a plus. It's a challenging work place but employee's are encouraged to take risks."
good,"Facilities for employee development are the best."
good,"Good management system, process system, culture."
good,"Working at Intel comes with many challenges (professional growth) and many benefits (medical, dental, 401k, stock purchase, discounts, and culture).  "
good,Very busy place with constant changing priorities and standards as well as procedures constantly changing.  Required constant focus due to all of priorities. Good pay & benefits but you earned your pay as very tired by end of work week.
good,The benefits are great and the people are easy to work with.  Each day is a new day and each has its challenges.  I have learned a lot in my years at Intel and having the ability to get further education and access to professional certifications is a plus.
good,"Intel has excellent benefits and a work environment that seem to care about the health and well being of the employee.  If your desire is to advance your career, with a little hard work it can be accomplished at Intel."
good,"INTEL is a great company to work for, the basic package is normally directly middle to upper-middle for like companies. Vacation is accrued at @ 80.5 hrs a year with personal absence at the same rate. All the benefits are beyond most companies. Working nights was stressful but being on compressed work week was cool as we had 3 nights off 1 week and 4 nights off the next. I had multiple managers with verying backgrounds, this made for some difficult times but also some good learning as to how to build relationships."
good,"Intel gives you option to either fast pace your career, take on multiple roles, hop from one group to another doing completely different products and roles, OR, take it all in a relaxed way with great work life balance. Its your choice."
good,"Career growth and learning is slow. Apart from that fact, it is a great place to work. Management always consider hardware jobs as best work and software engineers are not acknowledged."
good,"No time in/out requirement , Employees are having good time to balance work/personal life, culture is good , spacious office,  big cubical ,  people are technically good."
good,"Incredible benefits, flexible work environment, dynamic growth opportunities.  Through my career I working in manufacturing, engineering, and management roles."
good,"Perform scheduled and unscheduled maintenance on large chip manufacturing equipment. Strict safety culture that actively promotes and enforces a safe work environment. Everything is done by following written specs or procedures. A fast pace and constantly changing situational work environment. Technicians have to respond quickly to address equipment issues. So every day is different, base on the current production conditions. You have 2 breaks and a lunch break every day. There is a lot of time standing on your feet, so it's best if you are in good physical condition. Which Intel promotes by having their own site gym. Management communicates what the priorities are on a daily basis."
good,"Future is not quite defined as PC's decline. It will continue to be a large chip manufacturer and is looking at IOS and other potential markets .Lot of great innovation and product groups, somewhat top heavy in management. Tend to over engineer and be slow to market with non manufacturing innovations."
good,"Great company, very high tech, very strict anything to be done."
good,"Satwinder is willing to take on new challenges, and works well in team environment. He is always looking for opportunities beyond his assigned duties."
good,Intel was my number one place to work. I loved working there. Would go in suit up in a bunny suit and would go in fab and work on my job for a few hours then take a break and lunch and beak as scheduled. Great bonuses for meeting quota's. Excellent place to work
good,I liked do the preventive maintenance on the machines that I was assigned to work on. The hardest part of the job was to make sure that you were following procedures.
good,"My role was in the field of finance. I was assigned to a special project which is confidential. My typical day involved researching about the product to gain familiarity."
good,"Although i worked there for one year, it was a good learning experience and it opened many other doors for me. Got laid off due to company downsizing."
good,"12 hour shift compressed work weeks."
good,One of the best semiconductor company i have ever worked with. the job culture and salary packgae was good and people here are soo much helpful. Very proud to say that i working with the worlds top class engineers
good,There wasn't a clear goal and a lot of my co-workers either left the company or transferred to a different group. The group overall were a great bunch but management was another story. Intel was going through a workforce reduction while I was there and the emotions of everyone were high not knowing if they would have a job to go to the next day. Support on tools and general guidelines/methodologies were also lacking. I took a permanent position hoping I could help improve certain things and had high hopes for the group but instead people were either laid-off or were actively looking to transfer out. I was discouraged at this point and decided to leave the company as well.
good,Very good company in term of work life balance. their management is very precise that most of the day within 8 hr you can complete work. Even for intern also they are not create differentiate with respect to permanent employee.
good,"A typical day of work begins with a pass down from with the previous shift. Intel (validation/engineering) is a 24/7 company and you deal with engineering teams from all over the globe."
good,I had 22 years of great working experience in Intel. I would recommend as a place to work. Intel has excellent training programs and look after their employees very well as far as work life balance.
good,"made sure all the stations were the workers made there calls were clean and ready for them the following day cleaned the lunch room, bathrooms, hallway, cleaned windows to make sure there were no streaks and collected garbage"
good,"The salary, health care benefits and sabbatical benefits at Intel can not be matched easily.  There are no time clocks for salaried employees and everyone is busy doing their work.  On the negative side, if you want to have blocks of time for your kids in the evening, then this might limit your career."
good,Excellent employer with a great life/work balance. Very demamding work environment provides a lot of experience and opportunity for growth.
good,"• Communication and prioritise tester usage"
good,"Intel is a good place to work. Benefits are good."
good,Intel provides a very competitive working environment and good opportunities for challenging assignments and advanced opportunities.  People work hard and are compensated accordingly.
good,Helpful coworkers make challenging work interesting. Fun environment and the work life balance provided is really amazing. Flexible hours make it easy to spend time with family.
good,La cultura de la empresa es la mejor que he conocido. Pero la estabilidad se vino al suelo.
good,"Intel is the leading supplier of electronics and software solutions to the world.  Its products enable the world of computing and the larger Internet.  I learned how to be an effective leader, coach and a successful manager.   I interacted with diverse cultures groups around the globe and learned how to bring teams together to work on common goals. The experience at Intel was invaluable and something I am proud of.  I hope I can demonstrate those in my next job."
good,"Work days can get long but breaks are required for safety reasons as well as law.  I learned a lot about safety and developed goals of eliminating risks.  It is a solution orientated, data driven company.  I enjoyed the cohesion and comradery of my team."
good,"A typical day at work is doing attending meetings and getting your job done. When you meet with someone, you are expected to be on time and last only as long as you scheduled it for. All the co-workers are really nice and helpful."
good,"Intel is a great place to work. Lots of opportunities to take on more responsibilities and grow skills set. The only drawback is the work force is very old. While this provides room for work-life balance, it's not exactly the most exciting place to work."
good,Working in Intel is stressful. Safety is number 1 and we need to follow exactly SPEC without mistake. I learned a lots from Intel like how safety it it and quality. Products are inspected carefully every areas.
good,"I worked for intel my entire career and was able to advance through the ranks.  Overall I liked it, but over time Intel is getting bloated with beaurocracy"
good,"The company as a whole is a great place to work. The typical work day consist of typical wrench turning activities. A manufacturing Technician will learn preventative maintenance, and corrective maintenance activities on his/her assigned machinery. Most co-workers are good and very knowledgeable. In my opinion there are too many levels of management. The hardest part of the job is working 12 hour shifts. The best part of the job is getting 3 or 4 days off because you work 12 hour shifts."
good,Productive and structured company who look after employees very well whilst setting very high level expectations for individual performance
good,"I meet, worked with and worked for some really good people.  Loved the culture and the values placed on safety. A typical day would be to get pass down from off going shift then head to floor to set up our shift for the night.  Check maintenance schedule and inventory to allocate resources and then start working. End of shift meet with engineering staff to give them pass down of our shift events."
good,"I loved working at Intel.  The company doesn't hover over your shoulder and the culture there allows freedom to be able to make your own decisions and not be micromanaged.  Everyone is friendly and the benefits and perks are top-notch.  Great retirement benefits, you get a sabbatical every certain amount of years.  Telecommuting is possible and they are pretty flexible.  They have great events to help employee moral and team building."
good,A great place to work and build your career. Positive culture. Provide the environment where it will challenge your thinking as well as providing a structural career path that guide you to the next level
good,"Some of the smartest people on the planet work at Intel, and the education one receives working here is amazing.  If you love to work, and are a Type A workaholic, you will fit in very well and find the company you keep will drive you to success."
good,"Had opportunities to work in different environments & learn to work within a global engineering environment.  The company is large, with a breadth of products, which leaves opportunity for individuals to find roles that align with their talent & passion."
good,"working for Intel was 80% good only when it comes to job. revues."
good,Intel has a very good management and corporate culture.  It has a very dynamic work environment.  Intel encourages innovation and risk taking among it's employees.
good,"At Intel you meet people from all around the globe. You learn to work with different cultures and the way of making things, so you become a team player and practice active listening every day."
good,"Overall rating*                                      4"
good,At my 10+ years with Intel i grown to find that i had a friendly environment and helpful people. It was focused and challenging at the same time. Inspiring as well as humbling. it was the best company i have worked for.
good,Great company to work for. Challenging but rewarding with room to develop and grow. Benefits are great with a work schedule that I was comfortable with.
good,"Balance work place on safety, career development, and benefit. How ever some low cost product has moved to other low cost geo as a result, VSS was given."
good,It was a great way to see the world and get paid to do so. Hours were no good most of the time with no overtime benefits. Would not recommend to those having families that are not used to being away from each other for months/years at a time.
good,"-Whatever the marketing group need us to do and supporting the Intel systems"
good,"Love working here, not only is work fun but the benefits and work / life balance is good also. safety is the number one key while working."
good,The server business was awesome; diverse employees were sharp and using cutting edge technology to develop great things and fun to learn and teach others from within the organizations.
good,"Job was very busy and satisfying. Hours are flexible as long as you get the job done. Very rewarding and I would love to work there again. The management is hard core but can be understanding. The hardest part of my job was not the job itself, it was the nature of the industry."
good,"Actually, I really enjoyed work in Intel / Aepona. Due to some personal reasons, I decided to move to New Zealanad. Unfortunately,  Intel does not have a Software division in Wellington, otherwise I would be relocating my self to Intel Software, Wellington."
good,"On a typical day at work we always make sure that the station we are assigned is workable and the product we process is in place. We handle the process as it is prioritized."
good,"Great place to work! It is shift work, so you'll be working a lot half the week, but lots of time off!"
good,"Learnt life literally at this company right out of graduate college - survival of the fittest in its true sense! :)"
good,"I worked 12 hour shifts 3 days on and 4 days off and then vice versa the next week. A typical day for me was running the fab support group making sure that all areas of the fab were supplied with there test wafers and wafer starts. I also was the only one responsible on my shift for the upkeep and maintenance of all wafer handling tools. I  learned with my time there how to work well with others and how to grow into leadership positions. The hardest part of my job was learning patience to wait for the opportunity to advance my career. The most enjoyable part of the job was the friendships i have because of it and the knowledge i learned on how to troubleshoot, lead a group, and  become a continually improving employee."
good,One of the best companies I have worked for. Great people! Great teamwork! Promotes work life balance!
good,We worked hard and played hard.  Made tons of money for investors.  Most every other company I have worked for since could learn about discipline from Intel
good,"Planning and organizing great place to work events while managing extremely busy calendars.  Work with all levels of management.  Team player, get co-workers involved in activities.  Hardest part of job was, not enough hours in the day to complete all task. The most enjoyable part of the job is the employees, knowing that i've put a smile on their faces by help making Intel a Great Place To Work with all the fun social/network events."
good,"Long time employee.  Intel has good management practices, allows you to transfer to new jobs in the company.  Many good co-workers.  Good retirement benefits.  Global company with multi-site teams can drive late or early meetings."
good,"The biggest challenge, for some people, when working at Intel, is that you are surrounded by 'extreme' type A personalities who are also very proficient at politics.  You can be a part of some great teams and take on some very interesting challenges but you will need to ""play the game"" to advance."
good,"Increasingly high expectations to performance as you as promoted through the manufacturing grades-but not without reward if you are up to the challenge.Intel says it best to their employees-""you own your own success"".Some of the best managers I have ever come across and some of the worst-this should be expected in an organization this size-because we are all trained in Intel culture does not mean everyone will live up to it.People after all,are still people.Working compressed overnight shifts is quite difficult and your physiology never truly acclimates,but they offer generous differential as incentive.Learning about people and cultures from the world over is the best thing about Intel-they embrace and perpetuate diversity!All in all I would encourage anyone who wants to work in semiconductors to shoot for the top and that means Intel-not for the faint of heart though."
good,Very good company to work with. Good core safety team and easy to get along with management.
good,In Intel you can learn about the latest products that are used in many IT hardware today. This is a leading corporation in it's industry. One can learn a lot from it.
good,Intel is a great place to work! I am a contingent employee so there exists differences from those who are actually employed by Intel. Overall I work with an awesome team testing software.
good,"nice work life balance"
good,"learnt a lot"
good,Lot of Opportunities to work with different teams in Intel.
good,"Maintenance on Hitachi."
good,"Intel is a good place to start your career, lot of learning opportunities, nice people to work with."
good,"Busy, fast pace, interesting. Learned a lot through a variety of tasks. Enjoyed the work and co-workers. Intel is one of the best places to learn how the microchips are produced and how the microchip industry works."
good,"Typical day was to design validation tools,design hardware,write tools to debug"
good,I have worked for many major semiconductor companies and Intel is #1 for a reason. There is a lot of politics but overall I would work there again. They do listen to their employees. There is truly a team environment and as a maintenance technician I was respected.  They say Safety is #1 and they mean it! They stand behind what they stay.
good,"Have good chance to learn."
good,IT workplace is always under modification. Musical chairs with management and staff. Reviews are self/peer/management driven.
good,A excellent place to work if you like a very structured and organized work environment. The training is overall good and it sets the employee up for sucess.
good,DAY AT WORK
good,"Intel is a fast pace working place. Working close to the Manufacturing would constantly require the attention to resolve the defect issue and to ensure high quality and reliability of products. I was encouraged and provided a lot a opportunities to improve my learning and skill sets. I was able to work with a lot of cross Intel functional groups around the globe. We all worked with each other as a whole. As a Product Quality and Reliability Engineer, I would need to work with Assembly Test sites which were located in different countries. The different time zones would create a delay to resolve the urgent product issue when there was a customer needs to meet. Our group was always recognized for every new product certification and we had certified various products before the goal date."
good,"Having opportunity to meet managers and people from other disciplines and having 1:1 meeting with anyone we wish to talk, even upper level managers."
good,"As a technician at an Intel Manufacturing Facility, you have the opportunity to be exposed to several different learning opportunities. It is a diverse culture with the chance to advance your career as far as you want to take it."
good,"Intel is a great place to work. Compensation is very competitive, and work life balance is great! However, the culture can be a bit stifling."
good,a great place to work . Opportunities to grow at the same time always demanding
good,Good place to explore your potential and apply your engineering and interpersonal skills.
good,"Intel has great workplace culture. If you are in the technology space they are in the top few companies and it shows yearly. In my numerous years at Intel, I was able to learn and grow a great deal."
good,Great company to work for.    Balance between focus on core business but willingness to experiment with emerging market opportunities which provided years of exciting and challenging work.
good,Good culture.  Excellent work experience.  Clear management.  Team work is essential.  Good benefits.  Challenging work.  Good mentorship program.  Great location.
good,They really try to balance the work life balance with family function and the breakroom area and great cafeterias with all the different food choices and a doctor on site and even a bank and gym
good,"The work environment was a easy going place there were some days the workload was a great deal while for the most part it wasn't too bad. The people I work with made the work environment a lot more tolerable on those stressful days. What I like the most about Intel was the compressed work schedule one week I worked 3 days 12 hours a piece, while the following week was 4 days 12 hours a piece."
good,"Intel gives it's employees the freedom for work from home ,subsidized travel options, free fruits everyday. It gives it's employees the freedom to make decisions, all the required resources to learn."
good,"amazing place to work, amazing opportunities to learn and grow fast. Company culture is very positive. Process engineers work on shift hours which are impossible to sustain."
good,"involves few hours of coding, couple of meetings, lunch and few more hours of coding , great work life balance. Many onsite training and development opportunities"
good,Intel was a great place to work. I was involved in many different types of job roles as well as working for many different business units. I worked on many very interesting teams/projects.
good,"enjoyed the period of working in Intel"
good,"In general Intel is a good place to work. But as you work your way up the corporate ladder naturally it becomes much more stressful. Mostly the management I worked with was good, but over my 36 years there I had some bad managers too. I suppose the hardest part of the job was when projects didn't go as planned. The best part of the job was in my opinion the sabbaticals they offered every 7 years."
good,"Working at Intel was a good experience for me. I got the chance to work on different parts of the project, interact with many different teams, and learn a ton. "
good,"It was a good place to be as an intern. Found out big companies weren't for me, but don't regret the experience. Exposure to a lot of different teams and kinds of work."
good,"One need to have multitasking skill. Being a team player in industrial level is a must quality to have. Appreciation and recognition for innovative ideas. Inspiration and guidance to take it forward. "
good,"The management system is a different than what I had been exposed to prior to Intel. It was at times confusing but overall it always seemed like an invisible force guiding along. My peers were more flexible and open to conversation. There were a lot of former military service members employed there. The job culture rewards honesty and commitment. There is something to be said about the ""work-life balance"" as the long work hours allow for corporate work weeks to be split evenly between shifts so half the week is to working and the other half is to relaxing."
good,"Healthy work-life balance"
good,The decision making process is always speedy and data driven. People are very smart and they understand things very quickly even if situation is complicated. Flexible working time as long as you get things done.
good,I did chip manufacturing in a cleanroom. I learned a lot of electronic troubleshooting skills. Intel used the team concept in their work environment.
good,"Somewhat of a mixed bag around the business in terms of performance and approach, but I would count my years with Intel as some of my best.  If you are patient and attentive and prepared you will do well there."
good,"A world class organization and manufacturer. Hard to document all that I learned over the years, other that is was appreciated that they provided for employee improvement."
good,Intel is a very good company to work for. There are a lot of talented people from whom you can learn anything you want. Projects are good and work environment is excellent provided you get to be part of a good team. There can be instances where you might get stuck with wrong team which makes you do work that you dislike. Like other companies Intel does have politics between teams and sometimes within your own team.
good,"If you have the ambition and fortitude to survive in a fast paced Type A company, Intel is for you.  "
good,"It's a pretty rigid place - after all, they make chips. Their values include things like integrity and collaboration, so those sorts of things are really really strong there. If you don't mind having a lot of structure, it's great. If you thrive in structure, it's awesome. There's a lot of flexibility in some of the orgs and a lot of opportunity. I had the misfortune of being in an org that came to be very political, and my job was kind of redundant because of the senior fellow who basically ran around convincing various VP's to sign up for commitments before the planning got done. It saved a lot of time, but it left a lot of annoyed people in the wake and my job was smoothing things out."
good,"I enjoy the core of my job, but middle management have created an environment which has driven out many good people, reduced funding while increasing requirements, and generally made work stressful. I still think the company can be a great place to work, but I am not particularly happy in my current group, and broad hiring freezes have made it difficult to move within the company."
good,It was one of the best places I have worked at! Very good work culture. Good work life balance and if your manager is supportive you can grow very well!
good,I really enjoyed my time at Intel. I had a long commute which really took the stuffing out of me. It was 45 miles and when it got to 2 hours each way I had to look for another job closer. There was always something new coming out to test and try out. People from all around the world with many experiences.
good,This company is a great organization.  They are always on top of keeping top notch trained employees.  I dislike their rank and rating system.  It causes employees to suck up tp their management.
good,"Intel was really a great place to work. There was a great work/life balance and the benefits were awesome and competitive. The hardest and most stressful part of the job was during downsizing and times of uncertainty from location to location. The most enjoyable part of my jobs over the years was working within the great teams and the people I worked with. Over the years I learned the benefits of teamwork across all types of job roles (operations, maintenance, engineering,management and training) to provide a productive and quality work environment."
good,"Cafe gratis"
good,"Hours of meeting combine with manufacturing process issue resolution. Training provided was adequate to do my work easily."

good,Temp position working with Kelly Service at Intel for a special project at the Ocotillo Campus.  Hoping to get on at Intel as a blue badge.  The work is not difficult and the hardest part is getting over the negativity that co-workers have.  It is a relatively safe place to work considering the amount of chemicals that are laying around and unfortunately Kelly didn’t do any MSDS training so most of the people that are contingent workers at least are unaware of the chemicals they are working around.  Kinda scary since they use a lot of acids during their manufacturing process.  The management seems to be in the dark about what actually happens on the manufacturing floor but that is no different than any other manufacturing facility.  If management would take more time to see the process they might be able to see how and why to make their product better and or cheaper which is always the bottom line.
good,"Job Work/Life Balance"
good,"Bad Managers galore at Intel India. 3 failed back to back projects , strict suffocating deadlines leaving little for after work life. Micro Management by immediate managers left little room for innovation."
good,"I was a logistics coordinator for Intel via CompuCom.  I bent over backwards and went above and beyond in my role.  I overhauled the IT department's organizational clutter problem and made the surplus department a well lubricated machine.  I put my department in the black financially.  One day I show up five minutes late, and bam - I'm filing for unemployment.  The place is run by merciless jerks who want to get the best Silicon Valley talent for pennies.  My seasoned team lead of 8 years quit for that very reason.  Management opted to replace the experienced team lead with someone unexperienced they could get for cheap, and in turn the entire department suffered.  I made only 1/3rd of what the market rate is for my skill level!  There are San Francisco McDonalds workers who made more than me on local minimum wage.  It's a great company to work for if you are not a contractor or temp worker.  Don't expect respect.  You are always a nobody unless you are a permanent non-contract manager."

I have come to learn a lot of hardware design, from the early stages of design planning to the actual implementation and late design changes in post-silicon. I have coded RTL and synthesized it myself, as well as have validated several other functional parts. There is vast amounts of inspiring leadership in Intel that I have come to admire. People who are so adept and knowledgeable about chip design that it has always been an honor to work along side of them. There is nothing as rewarding as figuring out the next hard problem, and to know, that you are working on today's hardest industry design challenges, along the very best."

good,"I've worked graveyard for 15 years, which is my entire employment at Intel.  There are 2 shifts for grave, each is 12 hours long.  Night shift is a small community, and I really enjoyed the autonomous work.  Plus, night shift work is an extra 16% in the paycheck.  However, you miss all that Intel offers to people who work during the day.  There aren't any special events for night people.  There are no special classes and even the ""special meals"" in the cafe are second rate compared to days.  Intel has a huge picnic for most of the employees during the summer.  I say most because some departments, unknown to the employees in it, opt out of the picnic to save money, only to offer an alternative that isn't quite as good as the picnic.  My career opportunities were limited within my department, and transferring departments was a pain.  If none of that matters to you, then it's a good fit and the benefits (medical, dental, vacation) fit the industry standard."

good,"A typical day consisted of learning to use test equipment, testing WiFi and Bluetooth chips for performance. Sometimes I also helped with shipping, cleaning the lab, upgrading computers, etc. Management overall could have been better in many ways as they did not give assigned tasks so we often had to look for things to do to keep busy. Management then changed and they were unprofessional due to inexperience. Most co-workers were great but some did not work well as part of a team."
good,Excellent place to work. Long rewarding hours.  3 Bonuses a year.  Advancement available. Lots of support and training

good,Continuously pushing the boundaries of silicon manufacture and design and expanding into complimentary areas means there is many opportunities inside the company to grow and learn.
good,Great place to work and employees seem very happy most of the time. The work is hard but rewarding .I have worked as a contracted worker for at least five times each time it may have lasted for only 18 months (DUE TO CONTRACT LIMITS). Also I have been recommended twice by my direct Intel GL at the time and still was not hired?. I feel I have all their requirements to do  a great job at Intel. I have a AOS degree and over 30 years within this industries .

good,"Awesome company if you are a type A personality. Problem is that there are a lot of people who think they are impactful when in reality they are not. In a company this large it is expected that there will be pockets of mediocrity, petty politics and other stuff you have to deal with. "
good,"Se desarrollaba el trabajo en los horarios que uno mismo establecia, aprendí a manejar estrategias publicitarias y a compartir informacion y opiniones, la dirección excelente, lo más difícil el estudio de mercado para implementar las politicas y la filosofia de la institucion y lo que mas me gusto la colega con quien trabajé."

good,"A typical day at work involved operating and maintaining critical HVAC systems supporting production, working with vendors and other teams like construction and safety. I learned a lot about wet side mechanical cooling systems. Management was good overall. The work culture is fast paced, you are required to be on top of things, the work life balance is not very good. The most difficult thing about the job was being on call. The thing I liked most about the job was operating various HVAC systems and getting to learn about them in the process and working with vendors and other teams."
good,Great company. Innovative and forward thinking. Lots of learnings and travel opportunities. Great people who share culture of ethics and doing things right. However they constantly changing their business outlook so job security is not the best.

good,I felt good about the positions I held at Intel and my ability to learn my jobs and then perform them flawlessly.  I became the lead technician on my shift and the primary trainer.  Intel did not hold anyone back if that individual wanted to advance professionally and personally.
good,"you would think that 12 hour shifts over night would be very taxing, and it sure wasn't all fun and games, but great coworkers, plenty of break time, and shift differential made the suffering much more manageable."

good,Work at Intel is fast paced all the time.  A new CEO may take the company in can quickly change everything.  Can be a good place with freedom and the associated entrepreneur opportunities and just as quickly become more topdown controlling in nature with managers watching and controlling everything the workers do.   A good place for young engineers to get a start and many learning opportunities.
good,"I started at Intel in 1988 and saw a lot of changes in that time.  During the highly profitable times, Intel offered me tremendous career opportunities to learn and grow professionally and I will always be deeply grateful for that.  During leaner times, the culture changed as they enacting many cost-cutting programs.  A lot of the support structures were reduced or canceled, leaving the critical tasks to be done by the remaining staff which put tremendous pressure on staffers.  I always appreciated the great benefits but the workload could be soul-crushing, frankly.  And it was very frustrating that support functions were often put under managers with no background in the support functions (due to headcount cuts) which caused some unfortunate decisions.  My co-workers were excellent and I always enjoyed the professionalism of my peers there."

good,"Typical day at work was fulfilling, enjoyed coworkers and facilities.  I learned a great deal about systems to double check work for accuracy."

good,You own your own career. Network to reach your goals and get the position you will enjoy. You have the ability to work for a world class company and have real international business experience.
good,"Intel is a great place for recent college graduates, as well as experienced employees.  It is a fast-paced, high-pressure, high-risk, high-rewards environment that hires only the best.  The hours can be long, and the pressure to perform is high, however for those who can make the cut, the rewards in terms of opportunities and compensation are worth the effort."
good,Used to be a GRAT place to work!  Unfortunately with the economy Intel like so many other companies has gone through some changes.  Workers are not as valued as they used to be.  That's everywhere I think.
good,"Intel is a great company to work for but moving up the ranks from a contractor (green badge) to a full Intel employee is tough (blue badge). Often, contract employees are used for 18 months and no benefits or likelihood of advancement. "
good,The management encourages the attitude of troubleshooting the issues. That is a much needed help in testing.
good,"The typical day involved a daily meeting followed by coding and server maintenance. Bi-Weekly code push. I learned quite a deal at Intel, although it was a bit of this and a bit of that. Management and co-workers were nearly always helpful and cheerful. The hardest part of the job was working for a year and then not getting a full time position, but this has also allowed me to really expand my resume and job skills."
good,I loved working for Intel. I loved New Mexico. My first 2 bosses were great. My co workers were all supportive.

The company is full of brilliant, smart individuals who bring their A game to work every single day. The benefits are fantastic, and the company has a lot to offer from a personal and professional development perspective."
good,"My work with Intel was a contract position that only lasted a couple months. "
good,"Compétence générale de la société"
good,"Starting as a recent college graduate I was able to learn and grow as rapidly as I wanted to.  Unlike so many companies, Intel was willing to let me show the ability to learn new things continually.  I deviated from my degree many times and was always taken more on my skills and talents than mere paper.  Mostly a positive place to work and grow."
good,"I did my 18 month stint at Intel and enjoyed every single minute of it. It really matters who your working for and I was blessed with a group of professionals who accepted me as a peer, went out of their way to share and nurture the skills I needed and treated me a a member of their group. I only wish I could have stayed and still would return in a heart beat! I have heard a lot of horror stories over the years of being a contractor at Intel, my experience was awesome!!!!"
good,This part is truly unnecessary. I answered all the questions so my review is not important....it’s a good job ...the best in the state ..nothing more to tell
good,"No shortage of technically challenging problems. Unfortunately, frequently there are somewhat unreasonable time to complete objectives. Strong encouragement to take on and try out various roles ; has the unfortunate side effect of resulting in a high proportion of novices in almost every role. But, does encourage change and results in more broadly skilled coworkers."
good,Una de mis mejores Experiencias laborales en la cual ha ayudado a mi desarrollo profesional y laboral
good,The company is very supportive of career building.  Intel culture promotes mobility between projects.  There is strong encouragement to pursue greater contributions and responsibility.
good,"Intel is a great place to work. There are a lot of perks to working here, great benefits, and job security. Depending on the position, don't expect to stand out. Intel employs thousands of people at individual sites which may make it difficult for others to notice your hard work."

good,Learnt scripting and about graphics and processor methodlogy. Had flexibility of timings. Was recognised for quality of work and meeting timelines at many times.
good,Intel is a large company that allows you to progress and grow. Many employees feel stuck but this is usually because they do not understand all of the opportunities available to them.
good,"Very disciplined and results oriented company."
good,My everyday challenge to meet quality and quantity made my job much more productive. The company included the contractors to some of their company event which was a great gesture and felt rewarding.
good,I have nothing bad to say about my time at Intel.  It was one of the best places I ever worked.  Maybe the best.  Management was good and they gave me the freedom to do my job without any oversight.

good,"One of the most employee friendly companies to work!"
good,"Intel has a good work ethic environment."

good,Intel gave me a great job skill that can be used anywhere.  I received a lot of training and traveled when it was needed. I was able to finish my college education while working at Intel.
good,"This was my first real job after transitioning from the military. It was a great ride. I went from Technician to Engineer to management. This opportunity gave me the inside look at how a True tech giant operates from conception, to development, then mass production."
good,A Positive experience. I thought of it as being on a technologic volleyball team. Working together to create great products and learn new operating techniques.
good,"Intel is a great place to work for. Lots of opportunities to immerse oneself in leading edge technologies. Its a large organization, and hence decision-making can be slow. Very competitive work place."
good,"Intel is a great company, but be advised that that you have no long-term job security. Due to the nature of the business, layoff occur every 2-4 years. It is a young culture, and they have eliminated the majority of people aged 45 and above, per the last layoff..."
good,Great place to develop skills and management. Good work-life balance to maintain. Competitive working environment. The hardest part of the job is to learn time management.
good,"Good workplace, good mentor ship and team. Encouraging and positive attitude."
good,"its a fun place to work-lot of technically challenging problems and opportunities to work on solutions. Management open for suggestions and ideas "
good,"As a general manager, I often arrived at ~7a and spoke with Europe on any situations or problems concerning my product lines. After 8a most of my time was spent in 15-minute chunks, walking around talking to the people in our teams or having them drop in to my office to chat. Meetings took the remaining time (my staff, my peer group of managers, technical reviews, etc.); there were more lunches eaten at meetings than anywhere else. After 5p I began to receive the calls from our Asia Pacific region, with issues similar to those from Europe. I learned that I had to keep learning; our peer group generally agreed that we all had to completely cycle our technical knowledge every two years, as nothing stayed constant longer than that. The workplace culture was hard-charging, schedule-driven, financials-driven, yet we all took care to work with our people to ensure that they were satisfied in their work. If an employee had problems, it was up to the line managers (not HR) to resolve them. The hardest part of the job was getting the work/family balance in place - it was too easy to justify putting more time into the job and letting family obligations coast until the weekend. It was also hard to disband groups as we re-organized, which happened every year or two. The most enjoyable part was seeing individuals and small teams succeed, which we celebrated enthusiastically with parties and recognitions."
good,"Very FUN and productive workplace with ping pong tables, in-house Gym with complete weight sets of dumbbells, barbells  and weight machines. Employees are encouraged to take walks on the nature trails  in the surrounding nature of the Agoura Hills."
good,"It was great when I started. Amazing technology, very fast paced, a bit of an aggressive culture. It grew too big too fast on the labor force side, lots of redeployments eventually got old"

good,"good to their people... you could end up living for the company..."
good,"As an system architect at Intel, I have been enjoying the opportunities of surfing the cutting edge technologies, and research the best ways of balancing product feature set, reliability, cost, time to market, etc. The most fun part of my job is to build Prove of Concept systems in the lab for testing innovation ideas. When it works, it is a great thing for an engineer, and when millions units sold on the market with the idea, it is a life time achievement."

good,"Intel embraces diversity, encourages creativity and inclusiveness, pays well, and keeps you busy! Intel is on the cutting edge of cleanroom semiconductor manufacturing. This was exciting, because as an employee, I would get lots of experience with the newest forms of support, measurement, inspection and automation tools. Who doesn't love to work with high tech robots? The environment was fast paced, so never a dull moment. Intel also implements a continual improvement policy, which means you have to continually find new skills and new projects to complete. I liked that."
good,"Beside all of the cool perks, they are mostly enjoyed by daytime employees on mini breaks. As one of the  many night managers, We'd be lucky to make it to the gym. Be ready for a pager that goes off all night then prepared for a 07:45 passdown. Pretty brutal."
good,"Great hard working people! Fun place to work."
good,"A typical day would start with putting out any fires that have cropped up over the night. As a high tech manufacturing site, many problems were novel and complex and some defied root cause analysis. As a support team we spent most of our time fielding requests from around the site and troubleshooting issues."
good,"I worked as a member on the Platform applications engineer. Duties included constructing demos, setting up and testing customer reference boards in a laboratory.  Installing OS, installing peripherals, debugging."

good,Worked as a Paperwork operator and Secretary for the Engineering Department. It was a growing experience while working at Intel. I learned a lot but didn't get paid much. Wish I could of finished my college and became a tech.
good,productive varies every day. I learned that electronic can be very vulnerable during its processes. The management and co workers were good kind. the hardest part of work was working 12 hr. at night. things i enjoyed was when i was busy with work to kill time.
good,"Intel is a fantastic and challenging employer.  Great benefits, great compensation."
good,Gained a lot of manufacturing experience as an operator and further developed into the role of equipment technician.

good,A highly focused company with renowned management style.
good,Enjoyed working at Intel for 14 years. Management needs to be overhauled and held more accountable.
good,most difficult part was that this project was overstaffed and then delayed
good,would not have left given the choice. Company was instramental in advancing my career
good,You learn something new everyday and you have an opportunity to help a team accomplish something collectively and unique that will impact everyone in this world!
good,State of the art equipment. Training though has a lot to be desired. Had a a great manager. Green badge contractors not treated well. Overall a good company
good,"Lots of opportunity for growth. Different pockets have have different processes & cultures but the tops down culture is healthy & positive. Don't expect to be molly coddled. You own your own career and advancement, but you will be supported and treated well. Informal and formal networks are critical. Doing your job and not whining is expected."
good,"Great Place to Work, typical work day is filled with learning opportunities, Tasks are somewhat challenging, hardest part of the day, waking up to start your shift."
good,Working with Intel has been very challenging and very rewarding. They hire very skilled people and the culture is very results oriented. Lower management is very grounded and helps to coordinate projects. Upper management seems a bit disconnected and more focused on company profit than employee wellness.
good,it a great place to work the managements are good. it is a contract job no benefit all. no salary increments. but the employees are nice to work together. new projects are undergoing.
good,"Superb company, great career boosting experience, team work and collaborative environment, benefits are very healthy, however of your career focused at some point you need to make the decision whether to stay or Leave"

Tipo de procesador, memoria, disco duro y su correspondiente precio. Llegan los primeros clientes y se acercan para preguntarme por un ordenador para su hija."
good,"Very fast pace environment at times, but the experience reward at the end makes it all worth it. Management is great, but the team I was part of seemed to change projects very often due to customer needs, and in the end it led to our overall organization being bought-out to another company, which led me to find another job."
good,Had a good time. Great work culture. Could learn alot. Great services. Encouraging people. Could work in on-going projects. Challenging tasks given. Enjoyed my work.
good,"A typical day at work for me was discuss they day's work, discuss the plan for the day at the morning meeting, and then proceed to do that day's work. There was almost never an excess of things that would overload a team as the management knew what to expect of each task."
good,It's been over 5 years since I've worked at Intel so a lot could have changed. Established goals and key operational metrics that were used to measure work group's performance.

good,"Obtained broad exposure across all engineering disciplines including design, validation, manufacturing, test, security, quality with accountability to executive level."
good,Great place to work.  The company is changing and requires flexibility and a sense of self-worth. Management is under pressure for revenue and reducing costs.  Sometimes it's not always clear.
good,I enjoyed work for Intel.  Great place to work.  Fastpaced and challenging job.  A great working culture would recommend Intel. Expect a lot of changes and challenges.
good,My only complaint would be the velocity in which projects are canceled or downsized. They rarely give enough time to validate the viability of project/products outside of core CPU products.
good,"Intel is a great place to work. Their benefits are outstanding. They are very generous with time off. You are expected to perform at a sustained high level. Shifts are long and tiring, both mentally and physically. The compressed work week is great; however, expect to spend your first day off recuperating."
good,"I have been working with Intel form past one year. It has been a very good productive journey. "
good,"The work culture at INTEL is amazing.  The benefits are out of this world.  Advancement is not typical though, you can advance but the process doesn't make much sense.  All in all it is one of the best companies to work for."
good,"El ambiente de trabajo es muy bueno, para la empresa es muy importante que los empleados tengan un equilibrio vida privada/laboral."

good,"Due to a competitive market, Intel has suffered in recent years. Huge growth in the past and slow going more recently let to people being let go for often silly reasons. A friend of mine with 25 years  at Intel was let go due to a safety cert lapsing. A safety cert that he didn't use in his current job. He was a great employee too."

good,Intel has a great environment to work at. Dealing with HR when your sick or calling in sick is a little confusing. But overall working here as been a great experience.
good,"Safety, Quality, Output... a good mantra. It was a great company, but the downsizing of experienced technicians may prove it loses more than it gains. I was lucky when i volunteered to leave, not so for many others"
good,"I am involving several projects, and had chances for challenging new areas. I have a lot of  good colleagues for  discussing and  helping each others."
good,"to deal with customers face to face meeting- over phone, mailing, admin, quote/pricing/dealing with  all sales environment internal and external."
good,"Intel for me has been a great place to work. I love the work I do. I am happy with the salary that I get and I love the quarterly and annual bonus. With Intel, you never know when layoffs will happen."
good,"I still have friends that I met at Intel in 1993."
good,"Nice place to learn and work. Staff and Manager very cooperative."
good,My last assignment at Intel Aloha was fraught with harassment and lack of proper training from my colleagues. Unfair accusations! Managers are not H.R. savvy.
good,"As a Technician, atmosphere was generally relaxed to slightly competitive over-all. Corroboration was necessary since equipment components could be large and PM/ repair needed to be highly effective and efficient. Management varied, but the over-all culture was one of encouragement to learn and be excellent, so if expectations were not met, it could get stressful if learning did not go as well as management expected."
good,"neverending meetings and emails and change that password on those 3 different email accounts but they can't be the same as any other password or the same as a previous password and must contain one letter, number,symbol........"
good,"Good and productive work place. Collaborative, competitive and good work life balance. Good compensation, quality of work needed is very good. Learning is significant."
good,Compensation; benefits; freedom to come and go as you please as long as you get the job done; lots of different job opportunities with a company so big. Tons of smart people to work with and no lack of money to complete projects. Felt they did TRY to make life good for engineers but the nature of the beast is just 24/7 go-go-go-go and that will never change. It's too expensive to have down time.
good,"When I started at Intel, Intel was the epitome of an amazing company to work for. It was fun, they really appreciated their employees, and rewarded them handsomely. "

good,"Great place to work. Not very flexible on hours. Being present is important. Excellent management, clear and concise work instructions and expectations. Good team to work with."
good,"Good company with lots of opportunity. No longer a growth company though, so budgets aren't what they once were. Fairly flexible with work-from-home and work hours, but there are lots of hours required... whenever you put them in."

good,management care for thier employee and good salary all fair no hidden agenda i learn a lot about costomer services and to handle important materials item

good,"Very good company to work for. Excellent opportunities to learn and grow intellectually. Management is very good, for the size of the company. I had to resign for family relocation reasons."
good,"Get with a good team and you will be successful in learning and have a good benefit package. There are opportunities for POC projects that are risky, but interesting."
good,Intel provides continuous improvement for each individual that works there.  You are treated fairly and have a path for escalation when issues occur.  I just wish that the corporation helped the NM site stay a large production facility.
good,Enjoyed working for Intel. Wish I wasn't layoff in 2013. Best job I ever had. If I could return and work for Intel again I would. I miss all the people I use work with and teams.

good,The Project was offshore and we communicated occasionally through mail and voip and the Management/team was easy to work with
good,Great place to work. Work/life balance was awesome but layoffs were beginning to be more frequent and unpredictable.  My management was great but there is still the good ole' boy system in play.  Some managers need to be eliminated for Intel to truly strive.
good,Una de las mejores empresas creadoras de excelentes equipos de computación. Excelente experiencia pero por la extrema situación del país cerro el gobierno muchas empresas Privadas y sacaron a todo el personal
good,"When you work at Intel, you are surrounded by smart people. It is a results driven company but they know how to treat employees by offering lots of perks. Most locations have a state of the art gym onsite with free fitness classes. Drinks and fruit are always available and free. You can get free massages and they have a doctor's office onsite for your convenience."
good,The people are great to work with. This is a great stepping stone for growth and development.   Management trains and everyone is willing to teach.
good,"Great company to work for with great benefits and great life balance."
good,"Team effort to establish best practices. Compressed workweek balancing work and home."
good,I really enjoyed working for Intel.  The people are great to work with. I got to help implement Salesforce. I help the sales associate set up accounts.  The sales team was a awesome group of people.
good,"A day at work is great,everyday is a new learning in process the management is very accommodating in terms of new ideas, my co-workers are very supportive, the hardest part of the job is meeting the daily quota the most enjoyable part of the job is success on the target quota/deliveries and getting bonuses through out of it."
good,I loved working at Intel but the only reason to leave is that i want to do new and different projects. Unfortunately Intel has become too stagnant for me.
good,"Intel works on a condensed work week. It's nice to have 3 to 4 days off but on your working days you don't have time to do anything by the time you get home. Other than that I love my job at Intel, I just have a hard time working the 12 hour shifts."

good,to grow technically strong and in parallel life is well balanced. company has good care of employees in terms of health and other aspects too.
good,Intel is a great company. The work is satisfying and you can advance with hard work.  The culture is very competitive and can be quite stressful around review time.  I would recommend Intel to anyone who can get a job there.

good,Work life balance is really good and the rotation program is a huge plus. You get to work with a lot of really smart finance professionals.
good,Intel has brought many wonderful challenges and they will let you grow and learn as much as you want to.  Development training is always an option as long as your are open-minded.  Intel hires the best of the best and you meet a great diversity of folks who are smart!  They share their ideas and even though you may not agree you commit and disagree and move forward as a team.  Working for Intel has made my brain work and think outside the box and it is certainly a great place to work.

good,I was a Software Validation Engineer at Intel Service Division.
good,"Intel is a great place to work, lots of brilliant people. Work is always interesting and challenging. Open door policy, no offices for managers, everyone sits in cubicles, including the CEO. Employees get to review managers. 8 weeks sabbatical every 7 years is great."

good,"Excelente balance entre trabajo y vida personal, conociemientos"
good,"Intel is a solid company- they're not going anywhere. I got hired on while they're expanding. I'm surprised at the amount of leeway and freedom I have to do my work and to innovate. I'm also surprised at how many typical minor problems they have on the inside, but there are a ton of new people in my department and we're still adjusting. "
good,Compressed workweek. I worked mostly night shift. Hard to advance once you reach upper tech positions. Intel offers a lot of activities for employees and families.

good,High caliber co-workers and very interesting work. Great place to learn/grow. Reasonable paid time off is given and in most cases working from home is an option.
good,"My first experience of working in an industry environment in the United States. And it was as dynamic and challenging as most of the things I’ve experienced in this country. I got this opportunity due to a bizarre combination of luck and recent knowledge gained in microelectronics packaging course. I was selected to work in thermal and fluid core competency lab which is a part of ATTD. This group works mainly on mechanical and material aspects of chip packaging design, testing, and analysis to support advanced chip architectures and technologies.  This lab is lead by a cool, fun, smart manager who happened to a big football (soccer, if you will) fan and some very smart, hardworking folks in it. During my scanty tenure of just over two months, I made a good bond with everyone, shared drinks and learned a lot."
good,"Job Description: Responsible as a lead global instructor, developer and Manager. Provide On-Site and remote training sessions for True-Scale and Omni-Path fabrics.  Primary webcast and course developer for OEM, New Hires and Customer audiences.

good,Great place to work with awesome Benefits and compensation. Can be very stressful and chaotic at times but overall Intel is a great place to work. I like the extra time I get off from working a compressed work week.
good,"I worked a number of contracts at Intel before being converted to full  time. The contracts were interesting and challenging and I greatly enjoyed them. Once I was converted to full time I continued to enjoy the work I was doing, but I noticed an increase in the number of meetings and general office politics that I had been shielded from as contractor up to that point. I understand the interplay of employees in a work environment is largely not reflected in most contracting situations. Intel is like any other company in that sense. The challenge that was most notable is that Intel is a meritocracy, which tends to pit teams against each other and sometimes team members as well for recognition, raises and bonuses. The people at Intel are generally very professional and do not let this interfere with their work relationships or performance (in most cases it pushes them to try harder.) I enjoyed my time at Intel and the knowledge gained from the experience."
good,"Excellent pay & benefits but difficult to get to the next pay grade. Most years most everyone gets a good raise and bonuses who meet their expectation, which most do meet. I worked at 3 different sites spending a few years at each one and found each site to have very nice intelligent people thru out each site,  I really liked the 12 hour shifts the manufacturing has that rotate 3 to 4 days on then off. Most of the time most of the employees have a heavy stressing work load. I like staying busy because the shift goes by quickly, but  3 to 4 hours out of the 12 in the manufacturing part the work load will get to be stressing.  The company word wide has big layoffs on the average of every 4 years. If your willing to move you have a good chance to get picked up again at another site."
good,"Great place to work, great benefits, decent pay, lots of growth potential, I worked compressed work weeks 3 on 4 off then 4 on and 3 off. Would love to go back but I had to relocate for wife's career ."
good,"I enjoyed working at Intel. The Campus, security, and people overall were top notch and never had an issue. The management was very flexible to individuals needs which I liked a lot. Never had any problem support or the infrastructure and would recommend Intel to anyone wanting to work in the high tech industry."
good,"Great place to work.I have worked for Intel Corporation for over 14 years. It is a very good place to work and they treat their employees well. I would recommend this company to others who are considering Intel for a place of employment."""
good,The work is very structured preventative maintenance is scheduled daily. For corrective maintenance you follow procedures that have been written from lessons learned on previous failures. The hardest part for me was working nights. Most enjoyable is working with the people that work there. There are some very nice people that work their. Management for the most part is very good.
good,Loved it miss it and would love to go back . Long days at work Training is great buddy system in place to make sure your trained correctly  .

good,I worked for Intel for 13 years and had many opportunities to advance and shape my career. They offer great benefits and you get to work with some of the best and brightest mind in tech.
good,"An overall good place to work, even as a contracted worker like I was. There is a cafe in the building, only a short walk away from most places with GREAT food.

The environment was fast-paced and high-stressed, some times pretty chaotic, which I found to be fun and challenging most of the time. I was there for over 25 years, and I continued to learn new things everyday, and I had the opportunity to work with diverse groups of highly, intelligent people from all over the world. We had management teams which consisted of group leaders, who usually had engineering backgrounds. Their jobs were very demanding, and they worked with us to set company goals and maintain the safety of the employees. In my opinion, the workplace culture spoke for itself. We worked hard and played hard. I was fortunate to be on Teams with people who were like family members. Regardless of how hard a work day was, we were there to support each other without question.The hardest part of the job included the long hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with great people and meeting the challenging goals!"

good,"Intel working life was amazing/difficult as I worked for some 33 months away from home in UK, but enjoyed the experience as has often had to work on projects which required very short completion times. Learned great deal as I had to balance family time with working away from home. As the team size was small, had to complete total design from schematic capture from concept to final PCB layout design and was responsible for generation of all manufacturing documentations. Pressure of short completion often meant that changes had to be implement on the same day."

good,"I managed several production data centers and development labs at Intel Corporation, which provided 24x7 mission-critical support to Intel Automation products. This position included managing Infrastructure L2 teams and partnering with support teams from Networks, Corporate Facilities and Information Technology. I understand the variety of hardware platforms needed for integration and the infrastructure needed to support these different platforms in the data centers. I realize that Data Centers have limited resources.  Utilizing data center management tools, strategy planning and forecasting would allow for future sustained growth. Collaborating with all partners to deploy products on-time and providing the highest customer satisfaction are results that I would strive for in this position."

Management is great and encourages thinking outside of the box and risk taking. Teams and co-workers are great in that everyone is supportive and helpful and respectful.

good,"Managing a program at Intel is very challenging and very rewarding.  My day always started before 6 am because I worked with teams around the world.  Interacting with these teams was the most enjoyable part of my job.  Working across cultures brings along it's difficulties and being able to overcome these provide job satisfaction.  The hardest part of my job was having the accountability of the program but having no real authority over the people doing the work.  Because of other program priorities, as a Program Manager I had to be creative to make sure the work was finished as planned."
good,"Enjoyed job, Great benefits, Good People, Great training opportunities."

good,"Typical day was running meetings, driving schedules and meeting deliverables. Updating Senior Management on program status, risks associated to meeting schedules and plans to mitigate risks. Never wanted management to be surprised but also learned to bring issues to management only after throughly understanding the problem, showing plans or strategies to get to a solution. What the impact would be etc."
good,very good work
good,"A typical day at work is calendar management, handling emails, some fires that need to put out. What I learned from Intel over the past 11.5 years was how to get along with all different types of people and cultures. Intel is a very divers company and I believe that skill will carry me through life. Management was good, through most of my tenure, however, I did have my bumps in the road. I think the hardest part of my job, was anticipating what was going to happen next. Intel has lots of org changes and last minute interruptions. It taught me how to be one step a head. The most enjoyable part of my job, was know I made a difference in the group or someones career. Being an admin, you have to be the "" mother"" figure. You have to go above and beyond for the people you work with, to help make them successful, which helps the company be successful."

The coworkers I've had during both tenures at Intel were fantastic! They're quite friendly and knowledgable of theposition they're hired for. Noone is afraid to help one another with a task, operation or question. Intel has the extra ammenities that make you want to come to work everyday and do the very best job you can day in and day out."
good,"Intel was a great company to work for up until 2003 to 2008. Cost cutting suddenly became more important, and many good people were released. The few that were allowed to stay, had to make sure they were in the correct locations. Advancement for Intel was one of the more challenging aspects of the job. Expectations varied widely, and were not clearly defined. Different locations for the company had widely differing metrics."

good,"There is so much cliches about team work and group mentality, but Intel is the only place where the team around you makes or breaks your career. Everything is approached as a team. Work well in a team, and this is the place for you. Even managers approach problems in a collective manner. Its fascinating at first and maybe even strange, but its refreshing and rewarding in the end."
good,me parece una enpresa agradable. y con un buen apollo para el crecimiento. y porsobretodo la seguridad q nos brindan a los empleados.

good,"I worked for Intel for almost 14 years, on most jobs I had very good managers but some times you are surprised how Intel could appoint a person who has no job related education and doesn't want to learn anything about his job..."
good,"A typical day at work starts with standup in the mornings, free starbucks brewed coffee, and wearing as many hats as you would like to wear. Groups I've typically worked in for Intel employ some form of Agile development, and as such, you get to be a software developer, software validation, and automation engineer at any point. While it can be demanding, this GREATLY increases your overall useful skillset and has helped me immensely in my professional career. The hardest part of the job is that sometimes there are some VERY demanding schedules, but you get paid back on the other end with recognition and having easier weeks/months as well. My co-workers are some of the brightest minds in their respective fields and getting to work closely with some of Intel's Fellows and Senior Fellows was its own reward. Management can swing wildly however between the two different styles of groups. Money making groups tend to have happier employees and plenty of budget to make work fun. As such, management in these groups attracts the best managers available. On the other hand, money ""saving"" groups, or groups that only look to make certain parts of Intel process more efficient tend to have low turn over rates and higher job security at the cost of deeply unrewarding work. These type of groups tend to foster a mistrust of your co-workers as everyone is directly in contention for promotions and good reviews. On the other side, the money making groups tend to take the approach of ""a rising tide raises all ships"", so if they group does well, everyone in it tends to WANT to do well and works hard"
good,"Excellent company and great growth opportunities! Intel has been great throughout my 21+ years career. In addition to our many benefits and programs, employees get a bunch of other perks! Here's a peek at some of the cool stuff that makes Intel Penang a great place to work."

good,"I enjoyed my time at Intel, I would still be there today if I was not caught up in this latest layoff.

I have worked in all three facilities at different times throughout my 17 year career based upon which technology was being produced in which facility and where I was requested to work.  Intel utilizes the three facilities to rotate technologies as they advance to each new technology.  The facility which was manufacturing the oldest of the three technologies will eventually become retrofitted when it is its turn to bring on the newest technology.  Personnel on campus typically rotate with technologies to keep the skill sets balanced or they move to where critically needed."
