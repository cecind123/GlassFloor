bad,"I wouldn't recommend Group 1 Automotive's Service Development Center to my worst enemy. The root of many problems there is management. The morale has been down for years, and things like wellness programs, and free drinks in the break room don't make up for being lousy employers. We receive quarterly reports about the billions that this company makes, but the majority of agents don't receive a yearly raise, or if they do, it's mere pennies. This place hasn't been properly staffed in years, which means the current employees are being overworked. The turnover rate is extremely high, and the job is always listed online, or at job fares for a reason! Pay ATTENTION! DON'T DO IT!"
bad,the people and the place are the most corrupt business operating in Texas. They lie and steal from customers and break vehicles just to make a manufacturer pay for them in warranty.
bad,"Where do i begin. This place is a joke. Management lakes manager skills and peoples relations. I would put my name but group 1 may put a hit out on me to have me killed. They are deeply racist and sexist, and the nepotism is at an all time high. They basically made the bonus impossible to get, only just to pocket the money. The steal from the poor and like it. management having affairs with employees(initials M.R) This place is sick and the EEOC needs to shut it down. NOW"
bad,This has to be one of the worst jobs I’ve ever worked at. Management is a joke and they treat there employees like. Ppl are leaving daily. They make it impossible to get your bonus here. There is so many issues with this company it will be shut down soon. They have veterans agents leaving. No pay raise no nothing you are just a number here. As long as they meet there quota they don’t care about anything else here. Run as far away as u can else that goes I
bad,"Expect many hours, many days, very little pay, no recognition, management unprofessional and illegal activity.  Good ole boy network, must be in it to succeed."
bad,DO NOT WORK HERE!!!!! Managment is a NIGHTMARE! They do not care for their employees at all. Every time there is an issue management tries to convince you you’re the problem and if you don’t like it quit. They literally sent out an email from leadership saying if the job isn’t right for you quit instead of fixing the morale... THEY DON’T offer advancement nor pay raises oh and if you’re 30 seconds late you can forget about your bonus!
bad,"The management here is the worst! All of the managers. They are very unprofessional,  they lie to the accounting director about you when you don't kiss their behinds. They treat their staff like children. They have you doing $25 an hour work for $14."
bad,This was probably one of the worse jobs I ever had. The benefits were horrible and there was no flexibility with management to compensate for the horrible traffic on 290. They do not offer any type of performance incentive payments or paths so working there is status quo. Not a job I would recommend.
bad,Where do you begin? This place is HORRIBLE!! Accounting department is a joke! It's all a bunch of cliques. The accounting manager and the accounting director were not only daily smoking partners but they had a relationship! It was obvious. Everyone at the SBS hates it! DO NOT WORK HERE!!
bad,"Stressfull and unorganised, treat employees like rubbish and don’t reward in any way. Shame management are corrupt across all dealers. Wouldn’t recommend in a million years!"
bad,I have worked for over a year and my manager is a bully! Talks to you like dirt expects everything done now! Group 1 need to get in the real world and value their staff
bad,"Unless you work in sales you will struggle to get anywhere, 3 years of constant hard work with little or no reward just an increase in expectations"
bad,Management takes money from employees earnings. Extremely unfair company. Decent benefits. I learned my lesson the hard way. This job is okay if you can afford part time wages for 60 plus hours per week.
bad,"I applied for, was interviewed for and was hired for a finance position. I was asked to come on and work on the sales floor while they made the nessasary adjustments and I would be transistioned within 30 days. After 90+ days and the Finance director giving me attitude anytime I asked for a progress update I had to quit."
bad,"No work life balance, get ready to be cussed out and treated like your 5. So much disrespect from management to sales agents and customers. Lots of favoritism"
bad,"Management treats you as if you lack any intelligence, and takes the side of team leads even when it is proven there is wrong doing. The director plays favorites and does not have a heart or show empathy in any way. They preach integrity, transparency, etc but lack all of the above. There is no room to grow and they refuse to give raises. Don’t have kids, get sick or have any type of personal problems in your life."
bad,"They cant keep enough employees to do the job required because they expect way to much for what they pay, people are always being shuffled around, minimal training"
bad,"It’s just your typical car dealership. They preach honesty, transparency, teamwork and professionalism but, they couldn’t be any further from that if they tried. Just another big city dealership trying to get their piece of the pie."
bad,This has to be the most dysfunctional and unprofessional business I have ever been associated with. Management operates through fear and intimidation toward employees and disrespectful toward customers and employees.
bad,Worked here for just under 2 years and saw the company progressively get worse. There was little room for progression or career prospects. Was put on minimum wage considering the role I was in. The showroom I was in worked very hard and staff always hit targets however as some centers weren't hitting targets the whole group was penalized with the removal of a staff Christmas party or any kind of celebration. Heads of business took away gifts given to staff that were received from suppliers and gave these to customers instead!!! Absolutely no compassion or care for staff don't fall into the Group 1 trap.
bad,I left because management would micro manage people and treat us like we were in grade school.  Nothing professional whatsoever.  I would report them to HR but they did not help one bit.
bad,"You are only a number and not a person here.  They are only looking at what you have done for them lately and nothing else, i.e.   (how much money have you made them lately)  The management are crooks, most of the technicians are crooks and stealing from customers, but that’s ok as long as the cooperation is making money and the stock is going up.  Although they have core “values” they don’t follow them."
bad,"Understaffed to cover amount of users in the group in an IT helpdesk situation, stressful, too many hours (9 hours) a day and days a week, not enough pay for the role in general and amount there is to do, working with extremely outdated clunky CRM systems based off ancient operating systems which are too complex for the modern day we are in and the level of corporation they are used by."
bad,"When I started, I was promised $3500/month plus bonuses, with the opportunity to move to $4000/month with bonuses plus commission. Been with this company going on 18 months now, never seen a bonus or a pay increase. Have far exceeded everything they have asked of me and “broken records” every month I have worked there. Good people to work with, terrible company to work for."
bad,"While you are healthy and working, management never seems to have an issue, they'll treat you well and can be really pleasant, but should you ever get sick and go on medical leave, they will terminate you faster than their hiring process. Group 1 also never seems to listen to employees regarding issues with other members of management, even regarding how procedures are being ignored or when policy is being violated."
bad,Do not work here as a service advisor The training is horrendous s amount of work placed upon you is ridiculous the rude customers you have to deal with and your chances of getting bonus have nothing to do with you personally I can do with 20 other things involved with the store the manager is of no help worse position I’ve ever held
bad,"The hours are terrible. You will work at 7 in the morning until WHENEVER. If customers come in during evening hours and purchase a car you will be there until 10 or 11 at night or longer. It's the worst. There is no life/work balance. Your customers come when they can come in, so you will need to work on your off days, so there really isn't a 4 day work week. You'll work all day, 5-6 days."
good,"Training is two weeks and after months a class for 3 days in Houston, which everything you learn there will be null and void when you return. You learn by making mistakes and being told after the fact. You can ask questions but management is unavailable most of time when you need answers in the moment. Peers will help but tell you that your always going to be screwing up because they are always in trouble to for not doing it correctly"
good,"When  I first started, there was an air of opportunity and genuine comradery on every team. People came in for the opportunity to earn a good wage and make great bonuses that help change people's situations. "
good,I was constantly given extra job tasks on my already stacked load. I reached out to management about it and the GM never really had no solutions for me.
good,"Used to be a great place to work, now, not so much. Too many rules and regulations geared towards the elimination of the bonus and the people promoted relays on the POLITICS of the office."
good,"For the car business, it is one of the better companies to work for.  They could improve in so many ways if they would listen to their employees and VALUE their employees."
good,Loved what I did but felt like it was a battle when issies arouse.  Never got evaluated until you made a error then you got a verbal warning or written up.  Never felt secure in my position.
good,"Very fast paced environment. Managers varies depending on which store you’re with. Very competitive and high in sales. Must have thick skin, and be willing to work. Overall pretty good experience to gain knowledge"
good,"A good place to work if you have experience but if you do not have experience then you are in for a rough time. You do not start with a commission and have to hit a certain amount to earn it. The only problem with that is they lie to you about what you have to make in order to get the commission. The customers are mostly rude people and don't treat you with the respect you deserve. Only work here if you have a strong will and are not easily bothered by rude people and some rude employees. Again, not a good place to start your service advisor career."
good,"-Customer Service"
good,njo training store managers on the companies fixed asset policy and procedures.  I have also assisted the some managers in creating the capital budget for the store.  I also enjoy performing the physical inventories and put controls around special diagnostice tools.
good,Customer service/sales for over 50 stores nationwide such as handling incoming and outgoing calls to schedule appointments for the clients to visit the showroom.
good,"Very good place to work. Very nice environment,  good, intelligent people,   with normal payment for the type of job. I really liked it. The management was very nice."
good,"I covered the HR Manager role for a 9 month period as maternity leave cover and was welcomed into both the HR team and by the Site managers."
good,"Work life balance is tough, but reward and opportunity is high. Over very happy with time I spent there. Better experience compared to working with other auto dealers"
good,"In this company I acquired a lot of knowledge in accounting, my superiors had a lot of knowledge of the area and the work environment was great. It was a good opportunity for my professional growth."
good,Do not apply. This please is very stressful not good. Management has no clue on how to manage people. Upper management does not care about there employees
good,"It is a good company we’re you can work, with all the benefits, flexible schedule"
good,"Employees have the wrong idea when it comes to taking care of the employee, educated employees with the tools and knowledge to complete their task properly is the most important function in a organization. If we invest the know how, they will multiply their salaries"
good,"Friendly people to work with, committed to work with high targets to hit, long day need to be focused on a daily basis, management have a relaxed approach to flex working"
good,I enjoyed working for Group 1. I was able to find my skills and also work in an environment that was outside of my comfort zone. The training process was amazing.
good,I get to meet people from all walks of life and help them find the perfect car.  I love working with the public and meeting new people so this position is great in doing just that.  I love working and representing Group 1 Automotive.
good,"I have worked for Group 1 for over five years now, and have been lucky enough to work for two great franchise directors and have progressed within the company."
good,"Ótimo ambiente de trabalho, pessoas muito carismáticas, todos se ajudam e da para crescer na empresa."
good,"I worked for two of the Group 1 Automotive Dealerships and I loved my time there. I was able to build lasting friendships that lasted even after i left the company. I was able to gain a lot of knowledge and skills that transferred to my current position. I even learned a lot about cars such as changing my own oil. I was able to learn how to time manage, work under pressure, and also how to deal with a variety of personalities while keeping my composure. Group 1 Automotive gave me the opportunity for growth (and quickly I might add). I would welcome the opportunity to go back at any given time."
good,The company provides a good training program to get you started. They cover a lot of material to give you a good start. Being a service coordinator requires the employee to continually develop their skills with the tools provided. Setting appointments is what we do and we set those appointments correctly.
good,"Follow up on leads and customers.  The Automotive Industry (BMW, MINI COOPER, MASSERATI, PORSCHE AND AUDI.  Management was supportive.  Workplace was a true team effort.  The hours could be very long.  Customer Satisfaction and Follow up was extremely enjoyable."
good,"It's the automotive industry. Any one that is in the business understands why there's no business like automotive business. The harder you work, the more you will benefit."
good,"Having now worked for Group 1 for over 2 years i have felt the benefit of learning from the best in the industry, my leadership growth has been enhanced with excellent guidance and support."
good,"Great Company . "
