bad,"Do not apply! Stay away! High turnover! Very hostile atmosphere among union workers! Lots of drama and fake stories made against people! Union does nothing! Management is ran backwards! People are very miserable to work with! Very negative! If you’re someone that has a head on your shoulders and are ambitious to start a career somewhere, do not work here! This job isn’t for smart,positive minded people. . Even though everything is seniority base, people still try to"
bad,"General Motors the company is far different than working with Unifor which is owned & operated by the Local 81/Freemasons. The union has zero respect for new comers, and they will try to shoot their own guys. If you are lucky enough to be targeted by union you will experience threats that regarded your home, family, and whatever else those goons can use to scare you. The union targets hard working young people, and anyone who knows what is really going on in there knows that young women will be harassed by the men regardless of how good they look."
bad,"They treat temporary workers like slaves. There are temporary workers who have been there 3 to 5 years... With no paid vacation, no sick days, no vision or dental insurance."
bad,Terrible company with terrible work atmosphere run but a bunch of ignorant clowns. I would never recommend anyone buying there product and certainly wouldn't recommend anyone to work there. Once upon a time sure but it's a toilet company with grabage work.
bad,Wouldnt recommend this company to anyone anymore .You are walking on egg shells at work every day and it is high stressfull . Lots of other and better places to work . No job securuty any more
bad,They aint that  grand of company to work for anymore they find every way to cut pay to there employess like right know they bring you in as a temp any when you get close to get permit employment they will let you go saying that you aint needed anymore and the union lets them get away with it
bad,Would never recommend this place to anyone. They do not want to hire new people and use there temps til the end. The people that already work there may act like your friend but when it comes to money they don’t care about the temps that work right next to them. It’s all about what they get from the company while they lie to your face.
bad,"No employee value, especially as you age. Discrimination against disabilities. Human Resources and Leaders do not support employees being discriminated against. Workload is piled on these employees."
bad,During my time at General Motors I was a full time part time worker for 6 years then became full time. During my employment there I learned multiple jobs.
bad,Do not take a job at the Pontiac Power train HQ Center.  Very evil environment.  Everyone is back stabbing and no one can be trusted.  No sense of inclusion at all.
bad,"la entrevista muy pesada, exigen demasiados conocimientos que comparado con el sueldo es muy poco, además tienen preferencia los contactos y las mujeres"
bad,I was a temp that work six days a week for almost three years before I decided to quit because they never let us know if we were going to actually get hired on full-time to receive all of the benefits that everyone else received.
bad,"The managers were contracted and were only worried about their jobs,there was a lot of blaming and shaming by them and that caused a rift between departments"
bad,"GM has had plenty of opportunity to do the right thing by their employees they choose to make them all suffer keeping us at a lower wage with no days off no vacation time no equal pay, And absolutely zero profit sharing why would any temporary worker ever want to work here knowing that they will never have a chance for advancement or to be hired in!"
bad,Honestly cant stress this enough the people are worse than the job drama fest middle school all over again ..nobody cares about you your just a number and thays all you'll ever be
bad,Little to no chance of ever being hired on. Your pay caps as a temps after 3 years. You pay union dues but get no representation. They can fire you for no reason. They can move you to 3 days and back whenever they want. If you have time to waste go for it.
bad,Very harassing and racist place. No union representation. The fellow employees hate and despise any outsiders. Management is a joke and the racism is appalling. The union only cares about a select few.
bad,Run don't  wast your time. GM and use doesn't care about you. Don't listen to there lies.  They promise the moon and deliver you lies. They always have a reason way they can't do what they promise.
bad,"poor management ..no days off"
bad,You are better off at another company and this company is currently going through massive layoffs. Out dated technology and old staff members that don't know what they are doing.
bad,"Your typical evil greedy corporation that cares more about the bottom line then anything else. They cut every corner possible resulting in poor work conditions and bad products. Management would rather pretend problems don't exist, and use bully tactics to keep you complacent then actually look into matters to get this fixed. The company is an embarrassment. Not only will i never work for them again, but i will never buy another GM product."
bad,Empresa com líderes com posturas e mentalidades dos anos 50.
bad,New management every 9 months. No support. No growth. Unrealistic objectives. Replaces experienced employees with new employees fresh out of college to save the company money.
bad,"The main problem at General Motors when I was there is that upper-level management from Dell hired all their friends.  It seemed to be more of a cash grab by ex-Dell employees, then a genuine attempt at a proper IT buisness.  Which is probably one of the main reasons they had very large layoffs at the end of last year."
bad,"No se preocupan por sus trabajadores."
bad,"Been a temp for almost 4 years. Still not working full-time (not by choice). Do the same work as everyone else, get paid less, worse benefits, not hired in full time. Cant call in sick. Only 3 unpaid scheduled vacation days a year as a temp. Union isn't that good."
bad,"General Motors - one of the largest employers in the United States, annual sales of over 1.45 ""Billion"" dollars per year is a racketeering influenced corrupt organization, and I have personally got to experience this companies illegal power when it comes to blacklisting and ruining a person's career.  "
bad,worked there for 8 years. mind-numbingly boring and hard on the body. Make you stay over on second shift every friday and you never knew when you could leave til maybe 10 minutes before quitting time.  Always have to ring to go to the bathroom and sometimes you gotta stand there a really long time waiting for someone to come so you can go to the bathroom. Sometimes they never come.
bad,"GM is the 2nd worst job I ever had.  Your soul dies a little more.each day. Imagine being surrounded by 100,000 people who's souls are also dying.  It's not a nice place. Hopefully they'll go out of business."
bad,"Completely terrible company to work for, racist company, hard work for a little money. GM used to be a good company to work for. They will never hire you full time."
bad,"Worked several contract assignments at GM for 17 years with many promises of direct hire but never followed through. Had to file unemployment at Christmas and summer shutdowns, as we were not paid. Strikes too. We got the worst assignments, paid 1/3 to 1/2 to do the same work as direct employees, paid more for benefits and was blocked from many site celebrations and benefits. Most weeks worked 8-15 hours overtime with no payment - was expected to complete overwhelming meeting schedules and work assignments."
bad,"I worked for GM for 11 months and was bounced from job to job on an hourly basis."
bad,"Racism, HR is not your friend if you have an issue dealing with discrimination unless it's something out in the public eye they will reverse the complaint and hunt you like like a lion. Good company operated by the Good Old Boys Club."
bad,"GM is a lousy environment, with poor management with lack of direction.  The company terminates people at will every five years.  Lousy CEO, the company never learned from prior mistakes."
bad,The office politics were very unfair. I trained a person to get the raise that I truly deserved. I was responsible to issue accounts for repossession. When finished I would assist customer service. I also relieved the front desk for breaks and lunch. In addition I trained a girl in customer service and she got the promotion. I pulled the files from the computer and proved that I had closed the most customer service complaints in the whole department even though I was just assisting that department in my spare time.
bad,discriminatory. unfair. cut-throat mentality. people are disposables. no value for talent. work there only to put an MNC on your resume and move on and up. not a place to spend a career. I've seen many regret having given 40 years to this once respected icon.
bad,would not recommend a job to anyone at General Motors. They do not treat people right or fairly. You work very hard on the assembly line have to learn all the required positions to cover any employee.
bad,"very toxic environment unless you smooze with management you will never move up, even that is not a guarantee,good employees dropping like flies here."
bad,"You're nothing but a slave to them. I saw someone pass out on the line & the supervisor demanded that they move her to the side & keep the line moving without even checking on her. You are disposable to them. As far as the union goes, they're in bed with management, so enough said."
bad,"I am a temporary employee, I worked in metal assembly and I really really like it at first. I was on 1st shift I had my rides figured out and it was nice, but I kept getting shipped out everywhere not having any jobs to do or when I would get there the team leaders would look at me like I’m not wanted there saying what are you doing standing there “get to work” LIKE I know WHAT IM DOING! Seeing this is the first time I have ever done this work. They are so mean, they HATE TO TRAIN you and they don’t want to show you at all how to do things. There are too many  oldies who need to retire and let the new generation come in. Quit being so grumpy and mean to whoever comes in as a temp. Treat them with respect. You were once NEW as well. The union doesn’t care about you at all. It’s like managment that’s it. They just want to make sure your there to be there and work like there SLAVE. They will have you on a shift and bump you to another shift. Mess your whole life up!  And still not care about what you have to say. I pay union dues, can you guys have some respect for me?"
bad,"No advancement poor place to work."
bad,every time in a meeting I was talk down too. My manager was a control strong armed monster.  had to take holidays off to finish work and lost time with family
bad,"never work for GM, they does not treat contractors well and all managers feel on top of the world. they are insane.GM is one of the worst place to work for, they care 0 for their employees."
bad,Worked there for 20+ years and they continued to take everything from their employees working their the longest. The first 15 years were great working there. After bankruptcy my job became a contracting job and they took 23% of my pay. Moral changed and the great place to work became less and less.
bad,"I started as a full time Temp at GM.The trainers were very good. The managers would not allow the trainer to train people properly. The manages try very hard to get rid of people. Waited 3 week to get the first pay check. The work at this plant was very hard and they give you a 10 min break the first 4 hours. A lunch for 30 min.  A 5 min break if you work 9 hours. I cannot believe the UAW would allow people to be treated in this fashion. Almost everyday you work 9 hours. Some people have been temp for 3 years. Everyone on 2nd shift was a temp except for trainers, team leader. The pay is horrible. Do not wait your time. GM wants to keep a culture of Temp employees at the Baltimore Location."
bad,"This company brings in company temps. Doesn’t offer benefits to you. Lays off constantly. Won’t allow you to miss unless you a “full time GM employee”. The standards for the guys that will only dream of becoming a “full time employee” next to the regular employees are much higher. Be prepared to work awful shifts and 3 out of 4 Saturday’s per month. You won’t get vacation time, FMLA, benefits, retirement or anything that the “regular full time” employees get. You will be paid less than $15 per hour doing the same job that the guy next to you is doing for $30. You’re forced into the union, but have no rights even though you pay the same amount in dues as the other guy who is “regular full time”."
bad,"Anything you have heard about GM is probably true and then some. This is an aging out of touch company. The folks at the top are too busy high fiving each other and back patting over mediocrity to notice the dumpster fire happening in the midlevel. No one does ANYTHING in the RenCen. Literally, all the work gets handed off to vendors. The folks who work for GM spend all day on the phone talking about what they are going to do then go on vacation before it gets done, only to arrive many days later without a recollection of what they were working on. You will not develop your skillset at GM. You will learn how to push work aside, navigate weird suburban people, and get a glimpse at what is easily the most out of touch company in America. New GM is the same old GM."
bad,"Either you are in 10 meetings a day, work on 10 projects, or do nothing. Its all based on how your role in the company and the management does not feel like they need to change anything."
bad,"They have every 2 years employee feed back surveys ."
bad,"If you work hard you get to help the people who won't."
bad,"Company needs new hires with new coding experience , therefore they have developed a system that foregoes all your civil rights . They do this with very creative language , policies , and manipulation of the facts."
bad,"If you are an ambitious person, this is not the company you want to work for unless you are a really good buddy of the director or anyone at a higher level, then you are good. Otherwise, stay away."
bad,"You will be lucky if you get to work every Saturday. There is no room for advancement and supervisors favor certain employees. However, I wish any one who applies the best of luck."
bad,"Not a place for disabled vets at this company at all according to management. Never late, never missed a day never turned overtime down.Everything based on my disability."
bad,Un trato muy mal con la gente de laborales no contamos con apoyo
bad,"supervision lacking in integrity"
bad,Not fun to work at because of lack of knowledge. There are too many supervisors and all of them tell you something different to do. Not all supervisors have the proper training or schooling. Bias attitudes towards salary and hourly. Stressful and judgmental place to work.
bad,Management was very unprofessional and my pay checks were always incorrect the place was unclean and co-workers were unprofessional not a great job to work
bad,"You almost give your blood, "
bad,No new people will ever get a pension. I was left out of a signing bonus despite being an active member because I was on educational leave. I did not have a chance to return to work. The bonus was about $8000. That's a lot of money for a young person. I'm not sure if the American revolution was fought for more money than that. It certainly would have helped my 401k.
bad,Currently working with the Concentrix company is very disappointing due to the low salary and benefits. Currently the company has not given an pay raise in the last 5 years. Right now we are also working with GM products due to the Onstar products becoming obsolete.
bad,"I don't know if all GM manufacturing plants are like the experience I had at the Wentzville, MO location."
bad,"Good experience, learned how to deal with stressful situations, very long hours, not a lot of time to spend with family"
bad,"Very terrible work place, no lunch break! Very short breaks, hard work, no time for restrooms, terrible management terrible work place, works people like slaves"
bad,Hired as a temp. They never make you permanent. You dont get paid days off. You dont get profit sharing.  Temps have the worst shifts. You cant miss a day of work. They dont hire temps for atleast 5 years
bad,"a typical day at work was extremely hard labor, standing for 8 or more hours with very short breaks. The management showed favoritism and nothing was enjoyable about the work environment."
bad,"Don’t do it. No job security, reward the worst employees, bad place to work. The days of GM being a good job are over................................."
bad,mangament sucks to work for. they do whatever they can to make it a horrible work experience. Its like walking on egg shells the whole eight hours you are there daily.
bad,"Very poor management, low salaries, unpleasant work conditions. Minimal training and advancement opportunities. Location not convenient. Overworked, unpaid."
bad,"My overall review at International Paper was excellent. I was able to utilize my experience after moving back to Louisiana from Michigan."
bad,"It was a okay place to work. some what fast paced taking part to the assy, line as called for. the over time was great when we got. it great to see how a car was built"
bad,temporary employees should be able to have at least 3 sick days and 3 scheduled days off without pay... they shouldn't have to worry about their job if they have been there at least a year without any issues or absences.
bad,"Non productive work.  Harsassements from Development managers who never developed any programs."
bad,"Most of the Co-Workers are very cut-throat. Managers are terrible. Temporary employees DON'T stand a chance because they're part of a union. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone. If the full time employees are doing wrong, it wouldn't do any good to tell a manager, because, they won't believe you. Working there was horrible."
bad,"The days work was reviewing welding engineers proposed work plan and programming of welding robots. Often, 65% of the time, I had to make corrections to proposed designs were the welding engineers wanted to swap materials without reprogramming the robots and expect the robot to conform."
bad,"Not an ideal place to work.  If you are new to your career - looking for experience, this might be good.  But, if you are experienced at the management level, run away.  They are in this for money, and have little to no interaction with their employees once assigned to a specific customer."
bad,They do not care about work life balance all they care about is production ad keeping the line moving continually. Good money but the politics and drama is not worth it.
bad,"Typical day at work is very stressful. The customers are so disrespectful."
bad,Company has little direction for future.Lacks talented engineers. Pace of development in any area is extremely and agonizingly slow. Bureaucracy adds further woes to the lackadaisical pace.
bad,I was a temporary employee for 4 years and was laid off two different times during my employment. I also had no vision or dental insurance due too being temporary. I lost my job after exactly one year of being back with the company due to an unfair judgement made by a supervisor. Even though I had a bad experience with management I did learn several jobs and gained many hands-on skills. I worked with a variety of people with all different back grounds that really made the job enjoyable.
bad,"this job will drain you. Worked as a tier 2 representative for 2 years. Lack of management. You get written up for absolutely everything. Even if you do everything the customer wants, you can still get written up. If you love life and enjoy being happy, please do not work here. The moment you walk through the door, your life will be stressed out."
bad,"Muito ruim,a gente se mata e quando bate uma crise nem dão bola para o funcionário"
bad,Gm is a great place to work for. The people and management are friendly and easy to work with. The work environment is generally fast passed but very manageable.
bad,Jobs are very easy to catch on to. People and management are fair and reliable. The most enjoyable part of working at General Motors is that its not micromanaged
bad,"I started my day reviewing my objectives, daily collection strategies. I learned how to manage my time with proper speed and be efficient. I worked effectively with peers and contributed to cooperative environment. Hardest part of the jobs was hangs ups with out getting acceptable arrangement due to angry customer. I enjoyed the respect that each employee had for one another and we could work as a team."
bad,I was a temporary employee for 3 years and was never hires in full time. Hours are awful and you are treated like a slave. Management are rude. Everyone is miserable which makes for a depressing 12 hour day.
bad,The worst employer in the US.  Working for GM is like rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.  It is no wonder they went bankrupt.
bad,"work in the morning and in afternoon,past pace environment,punctual,the management are nice and approachable people,the hardest part of the job is working at night shift.I have a friendly co worker"
bad,"N/A, the contract company was good, but there is no communication among employees. The managing is poor, and the policies are not together."
bad,"Foi uma grande satisfação trabalhar nesta empresa! "
bad,Have a bad boss. Don't want to work here anymore to do his behaviors. I've gone to personnel with no gains.
bad,"A typical day was waiting to be told where to go and of course being a temp you got handed the worst jobs. I did learn about 25 jobs in the year I was there. The co-workers were ok. Ugh, management there was absolutely horrendous!!!"
bad,"GMS learning,"
bad,"All of my experience is pre-bankruptcy... hopefully they have gotten better."
bad,GM was a horrible place to work and I wished I had left sooner than I did. If you like to be verbally assaulted and have your job threatened daily this is a place for you. If you want your career to be based off of your merit then Run! this place is not for you. It is who likes you and who does not. Culture is cutthroat......
bad,The people that I commanded did not follow the chain of command protocols.
bad,Like two different worlds from an assembly line to  working in material  management in assembly treated you like a slave. In material management was down to earth and friendly
bad,"My day usually begans with achecking of equipement, how to do various things from building an auto to inspecting,at gm the were a lot of people that I met along the way some remain as friends till this day, I enjoyed moving to diffrent cities through out the world"
bad,"learned how to build cars, how they work, hardest part was to learn how to assemble a car while you are walking, once you learned to get the pace down it was enjoyable. learned what it meant to have good work ethics"
bad,"dia tipico de  trabajo , aprendi cosas muy buenas , silao  , los colegas muy bien  , la parte mas difisi era los turnos,lo q mas megusto fue aprender algo nuebo"
bad,Good Money but stress on expectations from Shift Leaders and area manager.
bad,Good old boys club mentality.  Upper management makes very poor decisions.
bad,el trabajo se basa mas en la actividad fisica es algo pesado y no se cuenta con la suficiente herramienta para realizar los mantenimientos
bad,"vendas de imagens religiosas por telefone, com publico de idade avanada."
bad,Fabrica injusta com os funcionarios da fabrica e muita perseguicao
bad,"This job was a joke at best. And not even a good joke that makes you feel all warm and fuzzy. The management worked against you and not with you. It's like they were out to make your job harder, but yet when they succeeded at this, it was YOUR fault that productivity was down. And the Union...UAW should be renamed SCAM."
bad,Too much to do and not enough time to do it and when you do it is never good enough. Not a good place to work if work life balance is important. 10 hours a day at least six days a week.
bad,"I would run the other way    Management loves management.   One guy told me he started there with Pomeroy making 10 per hr..,,,I started at 25   But have 5 degrees and 16 yrs in Engineering.  Could never get past my education making me feel stupid every chance him and his friend from Detroit could.  And since I had only been there 6 mo.   I was a Target even for the guy who ran (operative term) the PDC."
bad,"Management at the General Motors location in Bolingbrook is completely the worst, that was the reason I left was because there’s a lot of favoritism and others being treated poorly then other workers."
bad,"Everyone is afraid they could be impacted if they support an employee that the company deems should be released."
bad,Company eliminated too many jobs based on salaries.  People over 50 were walked out even though they were hard working people that received good evaluations.
bad,Management structure and leadership use bullying tactics to get work done.  Very poor planning is the norm throughout the organization.  Leaders are not open to employee feedback.  Promotion to the ideal level eight is given through nepotism and not individual performance.
bad,"I worked at the Defiance, Ohio General Motors plant for five years as an Hourly Production Worker. The physical and mental toll that it took on me will last forever."
bad,If you read this and end up working there you’ll think back to this moment and say they were right GM really does suck. If you read this and you run for the hills then you just saved yourself a horrible experience and your welcome.
bad,"Trying to be ""Agile""?  I don't think that word means what they think it means.  Stuck in waterfall.  PMO is not looking to provide value to the customer - only to complete projects on-time and check the box."
bad,"I have not progressed or learned any new technologies . The place is heavy in friendships and easily spooked by strong leadership or personality if you display it . Favoritism over rides skill sets or even education in some cases . A Very toxic environment , heavy in incompetence and always finding fault for trivial matters . When I left, I felt like I got rid of the cancer"
bad,just wish they were not laying people off.  The group I worked for was responsible for all service parts for every vehicle GM makes. the management was also good to work with
bad,"Job description was very misleading. Overall just a mismanaged department with 0 accountability. Very much a ""Do as I say, not as I do"" company. Poor pay compared to every other dept."
bad,If GM calls you to work for GM subsystems manufacturing do not do it. You make half of what normal GM workers make that are doing the same work as you. No profit sharing. Horrible benefits. No dental or vision.
bad,"If you work in the connection center this place is absolutely THE WORST. "
bad,"i worked Under Sub-contractor, so after your sub-contractor time is over about 4 years you are laid off, because General Motor looking cheaper sub-contractor"
bad,"a typical day at General Motors is stressful and the managment is terrible. the work place is hard the hardest job is bending and lifting"
bad,There are much better ways to make money. This place eats you up and spits you out broken. Management threatens your livelihood and now the union is just as bad
bad,"Management cared only about themselves. Pounced on anyone that didn't fit their mold. To worried about finding who made the error instead of correcting errors.  To many ""clicks"" within organizations."
bad,"The Litigation and Legal Department at General Motors is very poorly managed. The workload itself is pretty simple and easy to handle, and most of the attorney's are a pleasure to work with. However, there is very little organization and management, the workload is divided per the managements discretion, and if the managers do not like you, you will not get enough work. The management lets some of the legal staff bully and mistreat the other members of staff because they don't want to deal with the problem individuals. There is very little room for improvement or career growth. Contract legal assistants are treated like second class citizens with no change of moving up, your future at the company is threatened whenever you make a mistake."
bad,"That place ran on having band-aids put on everything. Machinery would fall apart every shift and management was never concerned about fixing it properly. The whole mantra was just to keep the line running, and quality suffered because of that. "
bad,"There is minimal advancement in the company unless you are willing to play politics and do no work. If you are looking to make a change in the industry and grow, them location is not the most optimal for you."
bad,"The job that I was responsible for included working on an assembly line in the Trim department. I was shown and trained on how to put on trimming for the Chevy Malibu. As for management and co-workers, I did not have a  lot of interaction with any of them, per I did not feel safe. The hardest part of the job was the hazing, bullying, and the major toll it made to my health. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help provide for my family and begin to pay back some of my debt."
bad,Wentzville General Motors is not reflected of corporate standards set by headquarters.  Wentzville lacks management and leadership visionaries that are able to take it to next level to compete with other plants.
bad,They want people to work 24/7 and there is no compensation for OT hours for engineers.
bad,"consistent lies about work hours and conversion. full time hours came to a screaching haul but they told us everyday we will work 8 hour, 1 day we only got 2, over 17.00 a hour but you need hours, so they start firing people for any reason. TERRIBILE!"
bad,Generally incompetent managers who never accept responsibility for poor decisions but eagerly take credit for other's accomplishments. Pay was good but not adequate when compared with executive compensation.
bad,"Upper management has no loyalty to temps (by the way your a temp for a minimum of 2 years!) You get no sick days or any kind of benefits until you are hired on. If you happen to get hurt and are out on leave as a temp you go back and either have to start back at square one and redo the 2 years as a temp or you get fired.. i got fired because i was pregnant and sick my dr took me out of work and gm sent me a letter saying i ""voluntarily quit"" because they dont accept drs notes"
bad,"I worked in multiple departments over my eleven years of experience at General Motors, from team leader to line assembly. I have worked only in the Wentzville plant but have worked all three shifts."
bad,Really don't care about the employees!...tell you one thing and do another...do whatever THEY need to do to get their money $$$.this place is not all that it's cracked up to be!!!!!
bad,A politica de redução de custos a qualquer modo está acabando com a empresa.
bad,"Employee suggestions to management and even on corporate surveys are discarded. People are now so afraid to give honest feedback in fear of being labeled negative. Micromanaging is so bad that half the time your scared to make a decision. When sales are down the answer is to buy bad deals?! Then turn around and scold the employees for buying the bad deals! We all love the belittling emails from management and the best are from the RCM. "
bad,"If you are family with someone at GM then you are taken care of. I witnessed blatant nepotism where managers would talk up other managers kids to get them hired direct over contract employees that had been on the job for 10+ years, nausiating! If you did say anything, you are targeted and retaliated against."
bad,management  was unreasonable .  people had too many cases and people would breaking down in tears on the floor due to the stress of the job.  Toxic work environment.
bad,Horrible place to work. Promotions based on popularity not merit. HR doesn’t support ethics or Diversity. Don’t relocate based on promises. People that stayed after Americredit merger were promoted to VP and manager roles with absolutely no experience and they resent new people being hired to correct their huge mistakes. This place has tons of EEOC violations!
bad,Worst place I ever worked UAW is a joke all they want is your money. They don't care if you see your family or why you might need off work your just a badge number to them. Everything they tell you at orientation is a lie just to get you in the door then your buttis theirs. UAW will only help you if it benefits them so your screwed if you depend on them. I suggest keep job hunting
bad,"Horrible experience.  Was given a job assignment that was impossible to complete due to union restrictions.  Moved to Maintenance team leader only to be let go so another could be advanced.  Lied to and stabbed in the back on a daily bases.  My last evaluation i recieved was a complete lie so i could get pushed out the door so a coworker could advance.   At the end of this experience it cost me my marraige, family, and all of my savings.  By far the worst decision i have ever made in my life to work at GM as salary."
bad,"A dinosaur of a company that is driven by profit and investor greed since accepting a government buy out.  Given their current path,  anothet bankruptcy is likely imminent as they purged all their automotive knowledge with the last round of layoffs."
bad,"Good pay and decent benefits. Poor work/life balance, long hours and many weekends. Company frequently ignores safety and quality to achieve production schedule. Communication from upper management is poor. Expectations are often unrealistic."
bad,"I worked the afternoon/night shift at GM. This was one of the worst and most depressing jobs I have ever had. "
bad,"Work with people who dont care about the job. Most employees are under the influence of something. People steal food, equiptment, gloves, etc daily. Biased attitudes from salary employees to hourly employess. treated like a number."
bad,I've worked at general motors for almost eleven years now and its been nothin but high levels of stress for me personally. It's like a giant high school with alot of he said she said things going on. You're constantly micro managed and treated as a bidy to fill a job and not an individual.
bad,"This department is bringing in a H1B worker who is currently working for another company.  The safety and crash CAE leadership is pushing HR to hire some people as a salaried employee at GM, when there are other qualified US citizens who can perform this role. They are going through back channel without giving a chance to highly skilled US citizens who have the similar experience and more knowledge.  This is happening in lot of departments in GM, specifically in Global CAE"
bad,"No proper direction from management and no sense of ownership. Middle management is lost in the power struggle and favoritism game and not identifying true talent."
bad,This is the worst work experience I have ever had and I have had a lot of jobs.  Don't take the moving package. It is like making a deal with the devil.  Management is horrible and office politics are everywhere.  Save some yourself some grief and dont work here.
bad,So.....glad i left the place it was so....taxing on the body and the cut throat environment was as bad as it gets. I was laid off and i never went back.
bad,Stay away from GCCX/CEI (Connected Ecosystem Integration) in Roswell.  The management in Roswell is told from Detroit how to treat the Atlanta employees.  Very ugly scene.  You can give all you have and still not be noticed.  No chance for promotions.  Very political.
bad,As an intern there were was no structure or routine.  I barely had a chance to follow the lead engineer in the plant. The only thing I learned was that you have to find your own way because the program is not set up for you to learn anything.
bad,"I don't recommend working at GM- QA. A lot of politics/favoritism/ discrimination. Very stressful. Loss of good quality employees. Employees that provide quality work let go or forced to leave. Too much back stabbing.  Americans are treated as minority. Poor leadership. They don't hire qualified employees. It's all about who you know, not what you know. No career advancement."
bad,"A typical day at GM consists of being clocked in and at the team lead board before 5:58 am. By 6 am the bells ring and though it feels like school the atmosphere and environment screams isolation. The team lead will go over the level 5 board discussing pros and cons of the previous day as well as going over statistics and data that most do not know about. Then our assigned work stations are picked out, provided we have enough personnel to work the floor, more than one persons may get stuck with more than one operation to run. What I learned working at GM are the fundamentals of a plant line assembly from start to finish products as well as materials coordination of products and supplies from first in first out sequence. Management is very harsh and not people friendly! at 6 am the mindset of everyone is ""It doesn't hurt to be safe"" however management is rude and unwilling to listen to their operators whom know about the machines an issues with equipment, yet our words go unheeded. The work culture is beyond boring and quiet once your ears adjust to the white noise emitted by the machines. The work culture is keep quiet and keep to yourself, for if your caught talking, management reports you for a write up. The hardest part of the job is keeping awake at 6 am in the morning doing repetitive work for 12 hours with little to no human contact. Management doesn't side with you nor back you up, when issues arise with machines or daily number isn't met for quotas. The most enjoyable part is being able to leave at 4:30 pm to look for a better job!"
bad,"Coming in as a temp expect to get treated like an animal , we have to pay union dues but get no support form them. they cut our hours and days whenever they feel like it, during work they throw you any and everywhere regardless if you can perform on the Job or not. the managers blame you for every little problem that happens, short staff, your fault, a robot breaks down when you had nothing to do with it, your fault. most but not all TLs are lazy at the Wentzville,Mo plant where I work over all if you want to get treated like a human at work don't work here."
bad,"General Motors é uma excelente empresa, o que estraga é a liderança que se acham DONOS da empresa e acabam barrando muios funcionários qualificados de subirem de cargo. Liderança força o trabalho escravo."
bad,"Ambiente desorganizado, admiten personal sin titulo de alguna profesion"
bad,"Eu aprendi a ter orgulho pela empresa, vesti a camisa mesmo, a direção sempre deu liberdade e aprendi a trabalhar em equipe, a parte mais difícil é o excesso de trabalho e mais agradável é ser bem remunerado."
bad,Cant believe they are still in business and that anybody wants to work there.
bad,"typical day - non stop fast paced washing dishes, and silverware/cookwear in a hot, loud and smokey kitchen."
bad,"Little to no direction from upper management.Seniors in order to save their position, will play all kind of games even though they do not qualify.Everyone that is good at what they do leaves the first chance they get to work elsewhere, and new employees rarely last through the first 6 months because management is just that terrible.you won't regret not working for this company."
bad,This was the best and worst place to work in my lifetime.
bad,Negative atmosphere and no morale. No protection by union for white collar. Not recommended for people over age 40. Unskilled management and too much extra activities and training required at HQ. Terrible HR. Which is new and inexperienced.
bad,"Upper management NEVER learns from their mistakes.  All employees are interchangable and experience and advanced degrees are all meaningless.  Just do what you are told.  Thinking is not allowed.  If you are not identified very quickly as one of the very few high potential employees, just get some job experience and move on!"
bad,"I was within a splilt second crushed by a metal rack filled with parts. It was pushed over & fell where I once stood.  Management did not care.  I had to get the safety person involved to correct the situation. I was not paid my holiday pay & I worked the day before & the day after the holiday. I was giving less of work hours per week  because I am a short person. GM does not care about their "
bad,"If you like seeing your family or can’t be forced to work under pressure. This job isn’t for you. Bosses harass you, workers harass you. If the line isn’t running, there’s an issue. Gas leak happened and they made everyone stay there even with breathing difficulties."
bad,"They hire you and then spend everyday looking for a way to fire you"
bad,Gm is a very difficult environment to work for. Some Management make it very difficult to accomplish daily tasks. Mismanagement leads to working 7 days per week at times.
bad,"Normally, it takes a long time to get hired in. I know people who have been in the status for many years, 8+ years. 6 plants closing, all those employees are moving to other plants, temps have no chance. No time off as a temp, can’t be late or miss work at any time."
bad,"Management was terrible and had no knowledge of the department, policies or procedures. It was a very stressful environment. Constantly missing shipments due to lack of parts to enter into production."
bad,"Worked at GM for total of 12years, in two different jobs, 2005-2012 and 2017-2019. Unfortunately, I strongly realized that GM management is prejudice and have serious cultural issues. "
bad,Worst place to work but money is good. You can't go to the bathroom unless you have someone to cover you. Want you to give everything up for them but no security
bad,You work 6 days a week with a 30 minute lunch and no cafeteria so you have to leave to get food but don't have time to eat it. management is Poor and Union is ran over.
bad,Not a good place to work unless you young and work for cheap.  they practice age discrimination laying off  5000 people all mid to senor level so they could make their workforce younger and cheaper
bad,The worst work environment I've ever experienced. Got tired of fighting poor language name-calling that came from my immediate supervisor I love working around cars I love most of the people at work for me management is horrible
bad,They buy your soul. They use money like a drug to get you hooked and in trade they offer seven-day a week work schedules. There is no work life balance here.
bad,"Top management going in wrong direction, trying to impress investors by giving false and impossible targets and goals. Invested  so much money in autonomous segments  where not much scope to do business. Wasted lot of money on autonomous vehicle and you will never get that much business."
bad,"General motors and it's management teams do not care about work/life balance or about their employees in general.  People with disabilities and health issues are treated like trash.  This is not a healthy environment to work and I would never recommend it to anyone, ever."
bad,"Could be a steppingstone for somebody going to college supplemental income temporarily there’s no more pension or benefits for new hires be careful don’t get injured on the job. Sedgwick is there insurance company for Worker’s Compensation,You better hope you never have to use it they pay some quack doctor to say there’s nothing wrong with you when you were totally disabled.They will chew you up and spit Are you out just a number.Not a place for A career anymore Pensions and benefits are gone."
bad,"General Motors does not care about you or your family, to them you are just a number and you are replaceable. Very understaffed and they refuse to hire more employees. They only care about THEIR paycheck and nothing else. Temp employees are held as temps for YEARS and only given 3 unpaid days off per year. Management does what they want and the Union watches. This is the NEW GM, DO NOT WORK HERE!!!"
bad,"Relationships cannot be sustained in GM as they require so many Saturdays, young people can't date, people with children can't see their kids.  Management nor union protect you from injury anymore, I was very injured and now I can't work a normal job at all and live every moment in pain."
bad,"Unless you like to be assaulted by coworkers, forced union dues with no representation, lowest pay in the industry, no time off and no medical or dental"
bad,"The company treats its employees as subhuman. Anything that goes right is immediately entirely managements doing and they reap all the benefits and rewards for that, but anything that goes wrong is blamed on the line workers and they are punished, regardless of any evidence of managerial incompetence. The UAW in Wentzville spends more time protecting the company from the union members than the other way around, and the medical team there puts corporate profits above the health and well being of its employees."
bad,"General Motors is a very stressful work place.  Jobs are overloaded and management does nothing to make our jobs easier.  Management is lazy, work culture is very stressful and doesn't provide enough family time because we work 6 days a week.  The hardest part of my job is overseeing 18 different jobs without any help.  My counterpart is constantly on a job and I'm have the responsibility of making sure my department runs smoothly by myself.  There is nothing enjoyable about my job."
bad,"Middle and floor Management is treated very poorly. Upper Management to often disconnected from floor operations daily life. Thankless job, very frustrating."
bad,"Management is not friendly and will throw you under the bus when any issue comes up, fast paced at a tempo that is hard to keep up.  The culture is old school with yelling and hectic work requirements."
bad,They cut hours whenever they feel like it. Also they talk and treat you like less than human if you are not perm. NO  work life balance if you become perm.I wouldnt recommend anyone work here
bad,"A job, not a career. Very dysfunctional management. Get used to working shift work six days a week, every week. Minimal training. Poor corporate culture."
bad,"Management are Monday morning quarterbacks and have no clue."
bad,"GM is the worst place to work for... No wonder they've gone bankrupt; they are literally idiots.  They are incompetent at project management, they are incompetent at program management, and they can't understand metrics whatsoever.  They sit around pointing the finger at each other."
bad,"Management at this company has no problem stabbing their employees in the back. They talk about ""Innovation"" but do not mean it. They are only interested in keeping the status Quo."
bad,"They have no clue what they are doing in SAP. The new IT people are left out of key decisons even though they are the most experienced and knowledgeable. Too many people who do not know what they are doing and they will stab you in the back if you say they are wrong. Good luck with trying to implement best practices as there is no interest in changing anything. They adhere to a ridiculous amount of policies that are not necessary. Lack of access in SAP is the norm because the idiot who runs support will fight you on access you need to do your job. "
bad,"Very difficult to get anything done, frustrating. A typical day: management during the days will assign a task for the skilled trades to do at night and there will usually be some reason it cannot get done. It can be something management knew or it can be some obstacle due to the UAW and/or safety."
bad,They don’t let u miss a day and want you to be a robot senority rules so they don’t hire they want to keep you a temp long term. No way to grow and very bad work environment and temps are treated like machines.
bad,The company does not value its workers.  Upper management will lie to you to get what they want.  If you question their reason you will be punished in some way.  Area managers always threatening to fire you if you questioned them.  MGT will not stand up to the new hire/workers continue to dump more and more on the guys with time.  There is definitely a double standard at this company.  Pay is good
bad,High turnover in management.  Too many like minded individuals with extremely poor attitudes. Very clique-like environment that makes for uncomfortable work space.
bad,"Overall good experience but I would jot recommend anyone to work there, it’s very stressful and very fast paced, which is fine if you have understanding management, however the management was very rude almost like they were power tripping because they felt superior to you. The pay was decent and they had good benefits in place. Just not enough to make a career out of unless you don’t mind verbal abuse"
bad,"If you want to work for a company that lies to you, then General Motors and the UAW is the right place for you. The union is weak and has no backbone to stand up to management. As a temp you pay union dues but you get zero representation. One last thing and this is the most important don’t believe anything the union tells you, they have there own agenda and you are just there pawn."
bad,"If you like bullying and being intimidated at all positions this is the place for you. Salary was good, but not for the hostile atmosphere that you are required to work in"
bad,"Gerentes e diretores, com raras exceções, são carreiristas e não possuem capacidade técnica e de liderança."
bad,Working at general motors is a completely different environment than any job ive ever had. Its not for the weak minded or easily upset. Its management vs the employee.
bad,Wouldn’t recommend the place! Wasn’t impressed. After 12 years was victim to layoff. Management was constantly trying to squeeze more out of the employees. They treat temps terrible!
bad,They treat the temporary worker like they have no life outside of GM no time off if you need time off you may not come back and as adults you know when you are sick and need to go home managment seem to think nobody gets sick
bad,"i loved the actual job i performed every day, but it was ruined by the leadership. There is not one single reason that Pontiac needs to be ran the way it is. You have the blind leading the blind. Too many big egos in the way and prevent open minded thinking or put the block on projects/moves. Literally the worst group of people i have ever worked for."
bad,"My overall experience at Flint Assembly was fantastic but the one glaring dark spot was that of the management of the material department, if one shift didn’t like you then they black clouded you and the other shifts didn’t like you either! HR just goes with what the managers recommend instead of doing the do diligence and thoroughly investigate the problems. The material managers were unethical, immoral, and just down right unprofessional!"
bad,It’s not a bad place to work the reason for bad review is they bring u in as a temporary which isn’t bad if they would hire u if ur a good worker but they don’t they just keep u as a temp as long as they need you thing get rid of u with hardly a notice
bad,"For a place that supposedly has a union, you get treated as completely replacable. Temps stay temps for 4 years at a time. You don't get benefits or days off until hired in and then they are 3 days to a week. You barely get paid enough to afford your cost of living. Personal property is often keyed and/or stolen. You never work an 8 hour shift. Its 9 or 10, 6 days a week mandatory."
bad,Work as the two tier worker never will get hired in to be a Traditional GM worker.  Subsystems LLC is your title. The workers have been there almost 8 yrs and still not hired as a traditional employee. Can be racist
bad,They use you and have no loyalty to the workforce. Management is a joke and the union is no better. The pay and benefits are good but they get their money’s worth from you
bad,"Those who rate General Motors great have been there for 30 plus years or hasn't been to the Martinsburg location. They will start you out on day shift making you feel welcomed and telling you the greatness of the company, which it is but it won't be for you."
bad,"Working there is very stressful and management doesn't care about you. Yes there is a union but they won't do anything for you if you are a temp. Temps get the worst of the treatment. Even if you're not a temp, they don't help you out for much. They put you where ever they want and don't train you very well for the job. The only thing they do care about is making sure the assembly line runs. 90% of the jobs there are overloaded. So just after a couple of hours you are tired. They do have good benefits. You get full medical with only $25 copay for doctors visits. Vision insurance is limited. Good pay after a few years of being there as a full time employee. But it may take to or three years before you get hired in full time."
bad,"Very little job security, company does not care about there workers or families. Only thing good is the pay and benefits, other than that I would not recommend working at general motors."
bad,Excellent pay and benifits that's it. Everything else stinks. Extended hours without notice. 5 min of training on jobs then left to struggle to keep up with the line. After 10 years have 2 weeks of vacation but have to take during 2 week shutdown which can be different dates. 5 sick days per year. Can't count times I struggled through day of being sick at work.
bad,Since 2009 added back too much middle management that was necessarily cut in 2008.  Latest transformation actions has really hurt the company short term and long term.  The older respect is no more.
bad,"Being a Full time/Temp, management is just flat out AWFUL, they do not care about you, as long as they have a body working on that job, that's all that matters. They don't accept doctor's notes as an excuse for an absent day(s), etc."
bad,Good job as long as they keep the place open. Need to be able to stand and keep moving during your shift. Work is during the same thing over and over. Pay was good.
bad,"If I knew then what I know now, I would not have taken the job. It’s a man’s company. They do not welcome change.   Culture is very cut throat.  Disrespectful to women."
bad,"Fast paced, stressful, long hours, long work weeks. "
bad,"Arrogant, insulting, disrespectful management not following GM values and discriminating against employees, screaming at employees, using favoritism and nepotism. In total a VERY TOXIC and hostile work environment."
bad,"Come to office. "
bad,"No matter how well you do in your position at GM you are never acknowledged. Managers will find a way to pin anything they can on you to get you fired and replace you with someone that makes half as much. Even though the plant has a Union, it doesnt stand up for its members and just takes extra money to let Management single out and target employees until they Quit, retire or are terminated. It is a terrible place to work and I would not recommend it to anyone."
bad,"Great place to work if you have been there all your life, and you are waiting out your time until retirement. Daily work is juggling work politics, working in your own function without concern for other functions, and finger pointing. Corporate culture and mid level managers never changed from pre-bankruptcy in the current post-bankruptcy GM."
bad,"lousy work environment, constant lying by management, ever increasing work load, dangerous atmosphere, needless harassment. Management wants to find fault."
bad,"General Motors in the bowling green assembly plant has poor management skills and very weak union UAW. the only way in to gm as a full-time employee is through being a temporary, and being hired in through a national agreement of how many people will be hired. it doesn’t matter if someone don’t come to work and you are behind them on the list and you are a hard worker they will over look you."
bad,"As you know striking a balance between work and life obligations requires some of the more difficult decisions in anyone's career."
bad,"This company needs to be revamped overall.  You never get what you are promised and management is all about their selves. If you are looking for a lot of drama then I would say yes, if not do not look this way.  If you want to work with a lot of ex-cons then by all means have fun."
bad,"This company has old ways. A lot of people at the top who are not trying to change or grow with the times. They are old, lazy and not willing to modernize process to challenge today's new employees. If you do not assimilate you will be pushed out. If you do not do accordingly to them, which means take a blind eye and just accept a pay check and move on, you will be pushed out and told you are not a good cultural fit. If you need a job place holder then ok, but if you are looking to come in and hit the ground running, this may not be the place for you and they know it. Nepotism and ""the way we have always done it"" is live and well here."
bad,"I worked for the Arlington Plant not as a temp. ANYTHING GOES!!! If you want room to grow, THIS IS NOT THE PLACE FOR YOU!!. Very stressful job, lack of morals and you are overworked.  Anybody can become a supervisor- per diem, but the odds of actually ""growing"" with the company are slim to none. Seniority is everything. It's not for everyone- so be careful"
bad,Working at gm at first was a good place to work in up until the CEO 's of the company decided to move the company overseas and they only told us within 2mnths time that made me realise working for a private sector is nt good.
bad,While working with this company there were numerous times that I was either not paid correctly or at all. Also there was not much room for growth.
bad,General Motors has to be the worst job I have ever worked for. This is located on Ben White Boulevard. A typical day at work does consist of managing inbound and or outbound calls and relaying information to customers. I've learned great customer service skills and was coached greatly for improvement. Management on the floor there are unprofessional some supervisors that are available and do love their job. However when you don't like what your doing you tend to not really worry about performance of employees. The hardest part of the job well that just usually depends on challenging situations with the people that General Motors chooses to hire through the contracted company Concentrix. This was not a very friendly environment or perhaps I should say don't get too friendly with these people. They will do what they can to make sure you do not succeed if you have potential for growth well you almost would have to be a part of the gossip and alliances that seem to be happening among the HR department and supervisors on the floor.
bad,"Laid off half of the group to rehire at a contract company for half the pay and benefits. After that, treated us as if we should be grateful. Then hired people back but took them from the street before they took them from the contract company. Just before they did all of this I had my first bad review in 10 years, go figure."
bad,"Unions suck, be prepared to move several times over your career and watch other employees goof off all the time and do drugs, lose their job, and be rehired with back pay. Too many stories to tell, buy some good luggage, cuz you will be doing some traveling....."
bad,I was let go one month before I could retire. I worked for GM for 20 years. Now I will never purchase another GM vehicle. I don't understand why GM wouldn't have made the allowance with only one month to go. Now they have lost my business. I bought and/or leased a new vehicle every two years.
bad,"If your hire in as a temp don't get your hopes up. I was a temp for four years then let go the last day we worked before Christmas. Always being told that I was going to lose my job, so I was constantly on edge. The UAW did nothing for me yet I still had to pay dues."
bad,It was horrible nasty people who want to see you fail cause they got 30 plus years in there. No one wants to help you learn the job. they all say its not there job to train or apparently do anything. Just a long horrible 6 months at this job. With as lazy as the employees are I am surprised that GM is still in business the all want to get paid to do nothing and complain that they don't get paid enough.  This was the worst place ever. Management does not have a clue what they are even doing there.
bad,"Overall, the worst experience I've had outside of getting divorced or going to a funeral. Even funerals usually have decent food."
bad,"Hired for an 11 month contract, summarily fired on Wednesday with my co-contractors and expected to work through Friday. Manager threw tantrums. Traded my Chevy for a Volvo."
bad,Steady work but management does not care about anything but Production . Mandatory Saturday Suck.Great plat have a life or want a Divorce.I got out at a good time and reclaimed my life.
bad,Very disconnected between the top and the bottom.  Upward Managed organization a Manager will never push back on anyone above them.  Makes the workers jobs miserable.
bad,In the 3.5 years I worked at GM I was assigned several positions.  I loved doing the actual work I was assigned to do.  Many of the people I worked with were very knowledgeable.
bad,"My body of work was irrelevant. The better I did, the less my manager cared. There was no opportunity for advancement within the company. "
bad,Can't say much....not sure who's reading.  Just google GM Oshawa in the news and you'll find out all you need to know.  It was a decent place to work but they slowly eroded benefits and DB pension over the last few years.
bad,"there's a bad culture of bullying and harassment. Management and the UAW work together to get rid of anyone who questions the status quo. The union will constantly lie about everything to trick people into signing a contract that hurts employees and only benefits stockholders, which the UAW is a stockholder."
bad,"The IT organization holds almost unlimited potential that is not being attained due to management inadequacies.  Leadership at the director level and below continues to manage as if an outsourced organization with no strategic vision for organizational development or associate development.  Singular focus on the ""metric of the month"" regardless of the strategic cost to the company.  No managerial courage to fight for what is in the best interest of the company.  Cookie cutter ""yes man"" technology leadership team below the executive level."
bad,"Empresa ótima na formação de um profissional, Porém não valoriza os funcionários."
bad,"Bad policies for contractors, the worst actually. Don't look for long term here. If furloughs (unpaid days off) and layoffs are for you. Go for it. No recommendation from this guy."
bad,"Good compensation and benefits. However, this is a very unstable work environment and very inconsistent. Make sure your financial responsibilities are minimal before deciding to work here."
bad,"Ótimos beneficios,ambiente agradável,mas a empresa se comporta como empresa pequena no rh,contrata pessoas e não tem plano de contingência quando aparece uma crise,simplesmente dispensa o pessoal,tambem não existe rh,uma verdadeira bagunça."
bad,"A pesar de ser una empresa multinacional, las condiciones contractuales son pésimas."
bad,GM treas their employees badly and I was terminated wrongfully while I was on sick leave
bad,colleghi che amici davanti e ignobili dietro .la ditta su questo ci marcia .stipendi buoni ma con 5-6 mesi di ritardo
bad,"The complaint cases you deal with are generally the same, just different vehicle."
bad,"More cuts likely to be on the way - think they want to close this location."
bad,no job security as a temp. the work environment for a factory isn't all that bad although everyone complains. very nice facility. after all you're building the vette.
bad,Overall great experience but the culture has changed and not for the positive.  Sad to see things going in the wrong direction  Hopefully things will change for the future
bad,The management at our site lacks to enforce any rules concerning client rules. Officers are found sleeping on duty being intoxicated on duty and no rules enforcement
bad,"Process more complicated to what it needs to be. Managers have very low competencies in the field they are required to manage, hence they can not support you because they are ignorant."
bad,"The jobs are very hard on your body, care more about profits then the people that work for them. I learned how to be somewhere else in my head while carrying out my duties as a worker. I presently have a job that challenges me and makes me use my head, this is a job i very much like and am enjoying going to work and completing this assignment daily. The moral since the announcement makes it bitter sweet. I finally have a job after 30 years that I truly enjoy even tho it is physically hard on my body after 30 years of repetitive line work.The most enjoyable part of the job is the many people I have worked and become friends with."
bad,"I was part of the Global Service Desk and a Blue Badge. There was a organizational restructuring in December of 2017. Instead of being put in a role that utilizes my skill set, I was pushed down to answering level 1 phone calls. Then a month later another organization restructuring. And this time all service desk agents were being let go (blue badge and contractors). Applied to 2 job postings that I know I qualified for only to be told that I didn't. I would not recommend GM as an employer unless you like being treated like a number or a statistic. Now that I look back at the whole situation, I'm glad I was forced out. I wouldn't have felt job security there."
bad,"I worked for this company for 3 years as a temporary hire, 1 yr as a permanent hire and then I was laid off. I would advise anyone trying to provide a decent lifestyle for their family to steer clear of General Motors."
bad,"General Motor was nothing that I expected from one of the Big 3 companies.I expected an American Company to care about their employees but what I saw was a very toxic environment. "
bad,"not valued at all.   Everybody is just a number           "
bad,"8-9 hour days with mandatory over time.  The pay is good or at least used to be but chances of getting hired withen the next decade are slim to none.  Management wants to kill you and the union is useless, just awful turf war between two gangs that are both wrong and just want to ruin the other."
bad,"Empresa paga bem, mas sem qualquer noção de gerência,chefes mau preparados e sem noção de gerenciar."
bad,"This company is exceptionally disorganized. It is highly bureaucratic and slow. There are not enough experience hires to speed up the company. It could be a hit or miss, depending on what you want out of life. My experience was a miss."
bad,"In recent news GM has been recognized for allowing racially active people to exist and express unfortunately it lives in several of their operations.  The company is very large so this does not apply to all of its departments; however, when any company employs a large number of people there's a chance of having racist views on the payroll and it spreads like a form of cancer.  I used every method of reporting my violators some were in management rolls.  This eventually lead to my termination.  I may never get the salary GM offered for the same job elsewhere but I have regained my safety and wellbeing and removed the added stress imposed upon my family."
bad,"Hired in engineering without an engineering degree and was lied to about advancement opportunities within engineering. Though they will take you with any bachelors, unless its in engineering specifically career growth and compensation are severely limited."
bad,"If u want a job paying well I would recommend this job. But just be aware it will ruin your body, mind, and soul. Only one day off a week,Sunday's and the management is so terrible and unprofessional it is literally unbelievable."
bad,"For me, general motors was physically and emotionally draining. Hard on my body and mind. When I first started it was easy for me to work as hard as I did. Four years in and after having my child made it difficult to put the same energy into the job as before"
bad,"My role at GM was manufacturing production foreman, This is a high paced and high stress position. Constant battles between management and union with you on the front lines."
bad,"Had a very terrible experience. Worked in the plant as an operations supervisor and worked 80 hours a week. There was no balancing work and personal life, and I was blocked from leaving my position because the management believed staying in the plant was the best thing for me."
bad,"After 20 yrs and after turning down buyout, was fired for very flimsy reason. No insurance, was told not eligible for Cobra, no profit sharing, no unemployment. GM treats their experienced hard working loyal employees horribly. As you are being walked out totally humiliated and dazed, you cannot believe they would do this to you."
bad,"What i've learned is that GM does not care about it's employee's."
bad,"As GM has bragged about in the news, it is the best place globally to work for women (or any other diversity group).  As one could guess that comes at the expense of everyone else."
bad,GMC was one of the worst places i could ever work in the short time i worked there there was alot of work harrassment and the management there was horrible i reported the harrassment to the HR and nothing was ever done
bad,"Labor intensive is the best way to describe it. The jobs are considered ergonomic but many times they were not. The training was chaotic and difficult to keep up with the changes as many job instructions changed on a daily basis. As a team leader it was my job to do quality torque checks and maintain control of the quality of the jobs as they move through my team. The culture and environment of the job was very stressful. Rules were not followed consistently by the Supervisors."
bad,When I started in 1€71 it was a great place to work . about1980 it got really difficult to work there addtitude changed I ended up on disability with lumbar arthritis and bad discs
bad,"Did various jobs on the line.  The job was very stressful and physically demanding.  We are working 6 days at week.  So now time for my family.  "
bad,en general motors esta bien el salario es una de las empresas negras y en ambiente laboral esta pesado
bad,Only care about numbers not employees. Horrible manager. Union will fight for all employees. I was a temp at General Motors  the different times and was forced to gbp freon 40+ hours a week to 16 hours a week.
bad,"Terrible place to work. Management doesn't care about their employees or what happens to them, as long as another vehicle is rolling off the line. To that I say Adios! Enjoy Mexico."
bad,"If hired, you will be a temporary employee for YEARS, receiving half of what seniority makes, expect to live there. "
bad,"The team leads have no respect for others that aren't hired on to the company so they talk very unprofessional to you. It isn't any room for growth for a temp and the union only stands up for its workers that are hired on to the company. Some team leads act like they don't want you going to medical, they also have a large turnover rate do to a lot of weartear ."
bad,"Well first off, the union told us that they only had 3 positions available & there were 25 of us that showed up. So therefore they let us go for all sorts of stupid reasons. I was mainly let go bc I had a blow out & was late to work."
bad,Salário ruim para tipo de trabalho exercido. Mas com bons benefícios.
bad,"They dont know how to care for their employees."
bad,"At one time people loved working at GM yes it was hard work and hardly any time off.  1000 cars a shift do not make themselves.  Now the company does not care about employees, the standard of cars just the bottom dollar"
bad,"No room for advancement, horrible bosses, and little benefits. I Would never recommend to a friend. Pay is decent but the work is hard. The job is definitely not worth the pay."
bad,Does not respect talent and does not take care of the real managers!  Investigation process sucks!  HR does not do there job and there is no structure in management or order of who’s working for who!
bad,"I was a temp at the metal center, 2016 /17 If you are hired you have NO CHANCE of being offered GM employment. That is the carrot that they dangle in order to get people to apply. You are considered lower than low in the plant. You will be bounced around constantly, There is virtually no training there. I would not go back if they offered . Some of the full time people are cool. But the vast majority know there job is protected, and act like imbiciles. Of course, if you are a hot chick the married guys will be all over you. Bottom line, please dont make the same mistake that I did..."
bad,It was a great places to work for the short period I was there. The 2nd shift hours worked great for my family and I. I met plenty of nice people while working all the different jobs I got assigned. I still speak with them still to this day. All in all if the ceo and board could get it together it would be a nice place to work again
bad,Prefer not to leave a forced review about a company i currently or have worked for. This should be entirely optional. and the amount of characters one chooses to write should also be optional. Thank you.
bad,"At one time, Dayton was home to 6 General Motors divisions including one assembly plant. At this point in time, all divisions have been either closed or sold"
bad,"People would say Good Morning to whom they want, even though I express a good morning I would not get one back. Management in The Account Service Dept is horrible. The AVP has favoritism in the work place which is horrible and it's sad because the new hires can see it. There is no room for development, and they train and skill people who they want they shows lack of enthusiasm in the work place when the work place is a sociable place."
bad,A empresa enquanto o funcionario esta com a saude bem e uma coisa porem o funcionario a partir do momento que sofre algum acidente e colocado de lado e depois descartado. sindicato e totalmente corrompido.
bad,Bad working environment and doesn't suit the employee well
bad,"starting working here at a young age and learned numerous jobs , safety tips and how to work with a team or work individually "
bad,You would not to wish the workplace on your worst enemy. Those that work in management are treated like dogs.
bad,This was a fine job but the plant closed. I enjoyed the benefits but the work is too closely tied to market demand and is thus unstable.
bad,"Worked here with my dad , wife and father-in-law. Worked inFlint Michigan for 18years. Then moved to Kansas to work at the GM plant there. They closed the Flint plant. Retired in 2006. Please see resume about working here."
bad,"I loved working there, but when I got injured they treated me like I was nobody and got rid of me. Age liability. was treated unfairly. Never was late, always did a good job. Was told by the union and first shift superintendent that I was to report to work and when I did, management told me that I didn't."
bad,You'll never get permanently hired in. You'll fill in for people who are missing or on vacation. Clean safe good place to work. You'll never get hired in permanently.
bad,"Good Place to work, Lot of time away from home work life balance is non existent, Pay is very well management is very knowledgeable and willing to coach"
bad,"A very large company"
bad,"my career in auto manufacturing has been over 30 years, i had intended to finish up my time with general motors at wentzville assembly, however the plant decided differently as the plant laid off all of the flex trades people due to corporate and plant man agment decision to cut cost."
bad,"fun job to work fun like it every time great benefit  great pay"
bad,"Daily activities included working with all 50 states to answer discovery, respond to subpoenas, and opening and closing lawsuit files. Work was steady all day."
bad,"Empresa com salários baixos , muita cobrança , muitos acordos para tirar direitos dos trabalhadores , muita chantagem , muita lavagem cerebral."
bad,"Im always here even on holidays, I always have to chase my pay check every two weeks, they ignore the fact that I cant see my pay stubs and nobody care."
bad,General motors is good job to have if you arent a temp. Because if you are you will watch the permanent people around u get bonuses even though you do the same or more work then they do
bad,"I love GM, but if you miss a day, your manager will grill you until your cooked fine and well."
bad,good place to work good pay 8 hour shifts no weekends. Good pay good people to work with. good breaks. Getting to see the new cars come off the line and seeing the stuff that goes into the cars .
bad,"Medical department is stuck in the 50s. "
bad,"GM has a reputation of  two separate class of employees.  It creates a culture of them (permanent) against us (temporate)  Every perm.  treats the temps as sub-human no respect. Gets no credit for doing extra work. None of the perms will give the temps any respect.  Temps are treated with discuss and called names in a effort to degrade them. By the way perms can take off when ever they want,  do what ever they want.  Come and go as they please.  without any accountability.  Management turns a blind eye the union supports the behavior. Not to mention the huge gap in pay temps end up doing the same work as perms but for half the wage, and cleaning up their screw ups. Benefits are not the same not even close. In my opinion that is no way to run a company.  The co is only supported by the temps because the perms take off when ever they so desire.  Who's going to stop them??  Nobody!!"
bad,"A rotina do departamento jurídico é pesada, os advogados gestores não se preocupam com o desenvolvimento dos estagiários. A direção / gerência é de pouco acesso, e a cultura da empresa é totalmente voltada a resultados rápidos, sem a preocupação de treinar os recém chegados. "
bad,"The place is driven by 2 people , a inner circle network that needs to be broken to deliver fairness and a new vision to success. Sadly Sr. management needs to be replaced to allow this place to thrive.  People do not interact with each other , all worried about staying employed, ratings , and keeping up with the processes that are not clear.  Only if they take the time to talk to the staff"
bad,lunches and breaks become shorter. Waiting 10 years for full pay is ridiculous and things don't seem to be getting any better. Company constantly looking for ways to exploit employees and make the working environment more stressful for the people actually doing the job.
bad,"Healthcare benefits are high."
bad,You don't have sick time and if you call in sick they keep hounding you to make up the time.  they dont pay you if your out sick. the holidays either. They promise you a certain amt to pay you but they don't pay that amt.
bad,Empresa ruim. Aprendi apenas como operar ponteadeira e parametrizar robôs.
bad,"This company does not give any respect, especially to those that are contract employees. I worked there for almost 5 years and when it came down to getting a raise or bringing up the prospect of becoming a GM employed employee, it was ignored. After six months of battling for a raise and proving all the work I was doing, they still treated me badly. I worked 6 days and 50-60 hours a week and when I wanted to take a long weekend to see my family out of town, management would be mad and there would still be work left from the weekend for me to hurry up and finish Monday morning to make sure inventory was accurate. There were so many politics between the management and the Union, that I could barely do my job without a grievance being filed. When budget cut backs and layoffs came, me and others who had been there (as contract employees) for 10 and 15 years were cut. And the people that replaced us were paid $5-$8 less an hour (my position was down to $8/hr). It was a slap in the face. What's worse is that 8 months after I was gone and at a new job, I got a call from a contract house asking me if I was interested in working at GM since I had previous experience. When I talked to the recruiter, she realized that it was MY OLD JOB and asked if I wanted it back at the rate that I had left at. Told her no thank you, I didn't need that stress ever again. I would never go back there!"
bad,"This was my first experience and I would not recommend to anyone. The culture has everyone angry and hating life. I ran into only about a handful of people who were happy and content. Management takes every opportunity to degrade you. It become very evident to me quickly, why those that have 25 plus years are still there...no one would hire them elsewhere with their lack of professionalism. Miserable is an understatement."
bad,"Management is HORRIBLE. Rude, degrading and not worth it. Stick to education kids. You could be fired over text message one day and have nothing to do about it"
bad,"They offer you salary then fire you, they will see what you can do them expect more out of you for less money. It was terrible and slow. Not for go getters, everyone puts their work on others."
bad,"Working at GM was the worst 10 years of my life. Firstly the management was as inept as the keystone cops, ALL OF THEM, and a good portion of them(I'm talking gl CT,TK) were bullies of the highest order. Of course the ones that were not outright bullys were weasels(LF, MD) and they all sat up a very adversarial atmosphere between contract and contract, contract and direct, technician and engineering, management and higher management. Fear was the order of they day, so every day was miserable they had no respect for the individuals who worked there and would work you 7 days or change your shift at the drop of a hat you life or family didnt matter. God forbid if you called in sick as I once did which was rare, got a long speech from long winded CT about not supporting the team and was made to work 6 weeks without a day off. I'm at a job now where my stress level is non existent, and you never know how toxic the place was or how miserable you were until you leave it."
bad,Management was horrible didn’t care about workers at all just cared about keeping the line moving and not shutting it done. If you shut the line done you got verbally punished.
bad,"Stressful would be an understatement. Management continually messed with our start times, stop times, break times to the point it seemed it was their plan to keep us off balance."
bad,"Pay is great, you will work long hours, and its a union based environment. The leaders are hands on, you must meet production goals. Not a fun place to work."
bad,"I started at GM as a Temp and 3 years later I am still a Temp with no clear answer on when they will convert any temps to permanent.  Pay is good and you get Health Ins, Holiday pay after 90 days and thats it.  You get only 3 unpaid days off a year and they have to be scheduled.  We have also been working 6 day work weeks since I started and still continues after 3 years."
bad,"Buena empresa para aprender, salario bajo, cultura laboral permeade por la diversidad, pocas oportunidades de crecimiento."
bad,"Hardest job I have ever had.  The pressure is intense, the support is minimal and working in an unionized environment such as this one is a monster all of its' own.  You will learn a lot about yourself in this position."
bad,"Starting out it was fun but last year,switched management several times ever time we had to explain what we did & why we were a value and why we  should be an direct hire instead of a contractor only to have our job moved to Overseas."
bad,"Good money, no room to move up racism at its finest "
bad,"Truly a joke!  You need to be on mgt good side (kissa zzz) to survive or get promoted."
bad,"The job was not hard, it was just repetitive.  the only problem i had when working there was being told i would be hired in and was then laid off after working for almost 11 months."
bad,GM only hires people in 89 day increments. They will use you for 89 days and then make any excuse to fire you so that they don't have to promote you or give you benefits.
bad,"I was fired without any sort of union representation. Union rep wouldn't even talk to me when i brought in a statement on what happened the day I was fired. A woman accused me of causing her harm and management did a TERRIBLE job looking into it. I was forced to work 6 days a week on a swing shift, making it impossible to enjoy my single day off from work. Overall, I would NEVER work here again."
bad,"Company is not quick to adopt new technology and keep up with the market."
bad,"Had a great first 2 or 3 years at GM.  Had team outings and a great feeling of camaraderie.  There was a lot of work and people worked hard, but it did not seem bad at all.  Then management changed to be a director from Detroit instead of from Austin and things got super busy and stressful and the fun workplace feeling changed.  Lots of on call and weekend/off hours work was expected.  "
bad,"With all the profit and tax incentives that General Motors gained over the years, the company is still at a brink of bankruptcy due to the executives/management self allocating wealth for themselves and spending miss management at the very top."
bad,"HR and management are horrible.  If they are after you, they will make things up.  Need to clean house of horrible management.  However, great managers walked out."
bad,Basically you are a minion with very little chance to move upward. They lay off the most experienced and highest paid team members to keep the lower paid inexperienced members. I would never recommend this company to anyone or would ever consider going back. Work life balance does not really exist. You might have a little flex time but you better make sure you have your 50 hours plus in for the week
bad,"They do not care about you or your personal life, only money. Management does not put safety above production, acting like it's quantity over quality. High school drama atmosphere."
bad,"Hi i have seen in my time at gm, were people who did things that were wrong but they turned away and looked the other way, no matter if it was agin not right but it went. I seen supervision do some wrong things and the so called union just them throw people out like it was they were getting off and having a good old time senting people home when they did not want to go , but when they wanted to go home than and only would they make them stay, because some how they said they did not really want to go."
bad,All Sr. Management is in Austin. Little to no hope for advancement above Jr. Mgt in Chandler or at any site other than Austin. Focused on college hire programs to bring in low cost tallent.
bad,"GM has gone through many “transformations” in my 15+ years, and somehow the legendary bureaucracy always survives and thrives.  Working here was challenging enough until the latest round of layoffs when things became almost unbearable.  If you wish to work on uninspiring, mediocre products and have all sense of enthusiasm and enjoyment systematically removed from your lifelong passion for cars, this is the place for you."
bad,GM is not a great place to work.  There is no job security.  GM is very management heavy.  There is major favoritism going on.  Does not value its employees.
bad,The benefits are great but the culture is not. Management does not allow you to make your own decisions and HR does not listen to any issues. There are too many meetings and no one knows what anyone else is doing in IT.
bad,"I just want you to be aware that there is no work. I went through the week long videos. Then sent to the plant floor to train for a week. Then I was told they would call me if they ever need me. It's been a month, and no call. So, don't quit your other job. This is not a career choice. I would of been 3rd generation hire. But, it's looks like I was hired as a pawn."
bad,"Managers do not know how and are not trained to manage people.  "
bad,"You would expect that working for GM would be great it inst. It is just a job no one feels valued or appreciated there. Many people who have worked here for 10 plus years want to transfer and they cant. You are never told why you didn't get the other position either from what I am told. The pay is seriously under motivating. It is just a job where you do not feel like you do anything good and are valued. The pay is non existent when it comes to the amount of work you are asked to do. You get a bonus sometimes depending on your department. It inst a great bonus by any means for sure! If you need a job....just a job apply but a career no, because you will wait forever to get achance to move up to a supervisor or anotherdepartment"
bad,"India managers dominate teams, protected India team memebers, very unfair to other team memebers. slave driver. managed teams using India culture. hate working there."
bad,Low and mid level management more concerned with personal status and advancement than quality of the product. Very few selected employees are offered opportunities for career advancement. Several non value added training courses required each year in addition to special projects that are very selectively graded to limit annual pay increases and bonus. The overall products do turn out ok but this is due to the diligence of committed employees not the leadership direction. For many years there was an annual employee satisfaction survey and the engine development arena scored very low - in the 20-30% range. The surveys were stopped rather than issues addressed. Good place for substandard employees to hide but the motivated should look elsewhere. Certain limited employees get preferential treatment and advancement with no noticeable accomplishments. Personality and behavior count several more times more than ability.
bad,"Spent many years committed to the various positions I held here."
bad,Trabalhei por 20 anos em sjc e fui demitido em 08/08/2015. Nesse dia era um domingo dia dos pais quando eu e mais 800 funcionarios recebemos a demissao via correio. Os 20 anos dedicados nao valeram por nada devido a ganancia e ma administracao. Nao voltaria a trabalhar nessa empresa devido a desvalorizacao do capital humano.
bad,"No stability, environment was unsafe, emergency evacuations are a disaster, weak union , too many chiefs and not enough indians, benefits are amazing which is the only reason to stay at this job"
bad,"Lack of career advancement. Leadership requires over 50 hours of work a week. Though over 21 days of vacation, there is no time to take it or fall extremely behind."
bad,Flint Assembly is set up like a prison. People are unfriendly and the management needs to make changes. Very unprofessional. My boss was an angry person.
bad,"In the beginning it was a good place to work. Nice co-workers, good pay. Management was poor they only looked out for themselves. Treated employees poorly."
bad,I liked most of the people at the plant I worked at but many just like in most jobs are two faced and wont hesitate to stab you in the back to advance themselves or provide job security to themselves. I enjoyed the work for the most part but management was poor and there are no advancement opportunities due to the fact of only temporary placement positions available these days.
bad,"Management does not care about you, no matter how much they fake it. You are a temporary employee until they decide to hire you; in my case, I spent two and a half years working for them before they decided to cut a shift and I am now being laid off indefinitely. The union takes bribes and is on managements side half of the time. If you ever do get hired on permanently, after five years you will have all the benefits they offer. (Health, dental, and vision)"
bad,"People there never lose their jobs (literally), so they are quite nasty to third party vendors and others that are not GM."
bad,"General Motors is an unfair work place to me. You have to fight for your work hours, days off, etc. You are quick to get written up if a minute or few late on breaks. Supervisors are at each others desks chatting away when needing help."
bad,"General Motors is a company that seeks to sell quality cars to the general public. They do well to treat their customers and upper level members with respect, but their lack of showmanship for skilled trades and production workers is severely lacking.  Those lucky enough to survive the butcher's block and make decent pay and benefits have to constantly nag their union reps to fight for those things to not be wiped out.  Their is considerable places to improve upon with how the UAW and GM treats it's members and employees that just improving cost of living is only a tip of the issues."
bad,General Motors has many racist Managers. The job does not care for its employees and will take all of your time from your family and/or life. don't work there or buy their products... might as well be blood diamonds. Not to mention- a lot of mistakes are made while building these trucks.
bad,They would call you while you were still at work to let you know you will be staying till 3 am with a 7 hour turn around to come back in the next day. They wouldnt let you request days off. They would write you up for anything just to fire you before giving you your 1 year raise. Good experience on alot of different security subjects but not a good place to work turn over rate is insane.
bad,"This is a fast-paced industry, a lot of scheduling, a lot of people stretched thin doing their best in several roles and a lot of stress.  I thrive in this environment and loved the job itself.  "
bad,At GM it is impossible to do my job which is to handle week to week operations. You're a firefighter running around all day solving issues. You're constantly being berated by the staff for what is going on even if the issue is not your fault.
bad,"working for this company as very hard, and the management was very unorganized and treated their employees like dirt, most of the employees were under qualified for their job assignments and management was no help"
bad,GM will not hire you direct if your over 50yrs.  On with unpaid furlough because of budgets problems except to loose close to two months pay.  Make sure you get the highest wage you can get.  There will be no raises or addition paid vacation days.  15yrs working for GM as contract was not fun
bad,A typical day is to sit at desk and take calls until you can break.  I learned that the auto dealerships do have to have ongoing training and do have trouble obtaining such and that GM training is a necessary part of the business. My co-workers were all a bunch of young kids who had no work ethic and interest in company at all but just to get paycheck and go home.  The hardest part is to stay focused and complete the call accurately and in a timely manner with all the silliness going on around. The most enjoyable was completing a call with the most customer service possible.
bad,I've learned that I am much stronger than i anticipated. The hardest thing about the job would have to be entering as a temporary employee. I have been a temporary employee for nearly a year now. You cant have any days off to take your child to the doctors office. Nor any personal time for yourself. The most enjoying part would have to be the adversity of the people. You never know what to expect at General Motors.
bad,Long hours. Hard to advance. Schedule unknown until the last minute.
bad,"Long work days, training was poor. Management is based on the good ole boy rules. Hard for a new comer to be successful."
bad,"While GM has many benefits other than your pay, it is very hard to increase your base pay while you are there. If you start out on a lower ring of the salary line, you will have to fight tooth and nail to get anything close to 'the middle'. Be tough when getting your foot into the door. "
bad,My time working there was horrible I had two terms with them and was let go for very simple reasons the have no room for error or mistakes your fired immediately!
bad,Good pay and benefits.  Poor management and no job satisfaction.  This company was all about profit.  Employees were just trained robots. The employees were great but no credit was given by the company.
bad,"Not much time for your family, they work over time as needed and it’s always needed. With not much time to prepare overtime is requested the week of, 7 day work week 10-12 hour shifts."
bad,"Não promove internamente."
bad,"Foi ótima durante um periodo, porém, os esforços jamais reconhecidos."
bad,"Some very smart, dedicated people working in an ""old-school"" company."
bad,"plant shut down and everyone lost their jobs, work was easy but General Motors closed up shop and pulled out of oshawa, leaving many families worried about financial income."
bad,Great place to work.  Long hours mandatory occasional Saturdays.  Healthcare is alright but changes from time to time on your benefits. Hard to get vacation time off
bad,"Work environment was very hostile and everyone was overwhelmed and over worked. There is no family balance. There no ""one team"" atmosphere, which they claim to want."
bad,Can’t work out what GM is doing in Ireland . They are not building for the future too many interns and apprentices.  They are like a car stuck in neutral since they sold Opel.
bad,Plan on harrassment and confusion of expectations by management. They will find anyway they can to keep you down and stressed. They will even try to turn your coworkers against you. Sometimes the money isn't worth your health.
bad,"Very chaotic and disorganized."
bad,It used to be a good place to work in the early 2000's but the 2nd time that I worked there the plant was in disrepair and lost alot of its former glory .
bad,Great Message that the company preaches but on a departmental level it is not followed. In my experience there was no openness it was more of intimidation that drove the culture to getting things done. Very aggressive culture and presented unnecessary stress towards employees that were doing their best to get the job done with what was handed to them.
bad,"Minimal department outings.  No upper management involvement.  No personal interest in employee, their family or outside activities.  Pigeon holed in the job you are hired in for.  If you are successful, they block your transfers."
bad,Projects start before a project team is in place and project manager is expected to beg and plead various leads to give resources taking up time in the overall schedule.
bad,I've worked here for almost 10 years and it's been nothing but drama the entire time. You should never work here if you don't like worrying about if you are going to have a job every couple of months.
bad,"I have been working for a year and a half as a temp for GM. The work is not for the weak of heart. It is very physical so age can play a factor for new hires. For assembly positions you will start as a temp with no promise of a permanent position. Most of the temps at my location have been a temp for 3yrs or longer. Buy lots of bandages and pain relivers because your gonna need them. You will get medical benefits after 90 days of employment but the benefit is watered down. The perms and management look down on you as if you were dirt. You will always get the worst jobs no perms want. And, you will be THE first out the door should they do any type of restructuring. GM is not the proud American company that they portray. They outsource about everything and care about no one. The union? Well, everybody likes a good joke. To sum it up, find a different source of income."
bad,"No loyalty to employees. Management in the Engineering Dept operates on a fear and intimidation basis."
bad,I was a temporary worker who spent four years working for General Motors. The four years I was intoxicated with the idea that I would be full-time with benefits as long as I prove I want the job. The job was never available for me to keep but the union lied and encouraged temporary workers to do our best.
bad,General Motors is a difficult place to work as work is sporadic and management is hard to understand.  Common sense is not common among management at General Motors.
bad,"they do not want full time management at GM , they only want to pay low wages to contractors and no chance to advance to full time . the plant runs well but no concern for individual performance"
bad,"working the assembly line at a fast paced environment."
bad,They have the worst management I have ever seen.  They fire people for this they did not do. They not know how to work together and when u try to explain something to them they do no listen.
bad,GM was a very draining place. The team leaders are never working or in a different group and there is no room for growth. They make sure the job safety is at the best minimum to operate. They keep people at temp status for up to three years with no paid time off and could fire you at any time before making you a permanent employee
bad,"Not a secure place to work. worked alot of hours for 6months then get laid off for two months, then work four months and get laid off again. For I huge company you would think they could manage the pace a little better than they do."
bad,"I like working at GM, only thing that I don't like was working night shift"
bad,well this was also in pune where had an opportunity to sell cars to the    local customers which was bit challenge as i dont speak marathi but not all the customers were marathis
bad,Je travaille à GM Service me on gagne notre paye dépend de chambre que on faire je avec un contrat CDI et a un moment que je dirais stop a tous ça
bad,el ambiente con los gefes muii pesado  y mal trato
bad,Ultra corporate life with a culty feel. My manager was micro managing and knit picked my behavior. I did not enjoy the work environment as the average person seemed like they couldn't really do their job well.
bad,"If I was to find something that needed repair, I would report it to my immediate supervisor.  He would then determine that I was not allowed to do the repair because of our primary company rules and have me turn in a work order.  I would do that, only to have the Maintenance Dept. and the Plant Maintenance Manager condemn me for not doing the job.  I felt like I was walking on egg shells every day at work."
bad,don't recommend no work life balance Union runs the plant union workers have more rights then supervisors.  If you have family kiss them good bye your just a extra body
bad,Everyone running around trying to put out the production fires and the reason is the management still have not figured out the controls and practices required for those responsible
bad,Poor communication between management and staff.  Not willing to entertain transfer to suitable position.  Required training insufficient and not timely. Lack of direction and training.  Salary/Benefits (average).
bad,"Lack of Advancement"
bad,"- Not good for learning"
bad,"The culture at treasury office is very bureaucratic and does not believe in moving fast on any thing. It works as the classic GM salute - I blame you, and you blame me."
bad,"Management is lazy and rely heavily on contractors to do all of the work.  I was not challenged enough in this position.  Being a ""go getter"" threatens management and you may be targeted for doing too good because you make the others look bad.  The compensation and benefits package it wonderful though.  If you can hold your head up high in an environment like that, go for it because the benefits might be worth all the trouble."
bad,"What can I say your a line Monkey, great pay, great benefits, however no work/life balance, lots of OT means lots of money but no time for family or anything along those lines.  Management is terrible, have no clue what they are doing or how to remedy things."
bad,"boa,mais muito capitalista de mais,não há momentos ruim a um disrespeito pelo trabalhador fora do comum."
bad,A administração esta em maos erradas.
bad,It was a family type business that developed new software for robots. They were bought by Hewlitt Packard. I enjoyed working with them very much.
bad,"Durant mon passage dans le service, l'ambiance était assez détendue mais le salaire ne correspond pas à la masse horaire éffectué"
bad,"Temporary job. Just physical work, nothing too difficult or noteworthy. Pay was fair for what they wanted done on a day to day basis. Would recommend for a gap filler."
bad,Wrong people are getting promoted and with poor leadership spirals poor production.  Major change needs to take place in order to succeed.  Customers are not happy
bad,Trabajo bajo presión los Mas altos mandos solo reparten su trabajo con los otros empresas que están dentro
bad,"long hours and not many days off, Wokk 6-7 days a week, not much training. Good benefits with good pay .  not much room for advancement................."
bad,"General Motors is an automotive manufacturer producing world class trucks, SUV's and cars. They have been in the auto manufacturing and finance business for nearly 100 years. Today the company's focus is on producing the highly profitable light and heavy duty trucks and SUV's."
bad,Well if you have a child that has medical issue  they will not have any sympathy for you and they might fire you like they did me. I did everything by the book the union want stand up for you they will let them do whatever they want to you your just a number to them.
bad,"Although the money and benefits were great, the overall atmosphere was angry and unhappy. GM works its employees to the edge of ridiculousness. They demand 6 days a week regularly."
bad,The temps get treated badly its not worth it u can get fired any time with no help from the union even though they take money out of your check every month there's no job security sad
bad,"Used to be an excellent job, but now diversity reigns as king. The heads in Detroit care more about a diverse work force than the tools needed today to produce their product. More salary employees than hourly. Show me a business model where that works."
bad,"Management is unorganized, temps are treated horribly and you barely get to see your family. As a temp you get no time off, no sick days, basic health and you work 6 days a week with 1 day off. No time to recoup lost sleep or time with your family."
bad,Benefits and pay were great right out of school but they do not keep up with the market and overlook those who excel and force them into positions they don’t want
bad,"I was excited to begin working at GM. However, having been there for four years now, I would not recommend it to anyone. The work is not hard, but because of the repetitive nature of the tasks, it is hard on your body. The constant bickering between union and management makes things way more stressful than they should be. Layoffs are always looming over you as is the possibility of having to uproot and move your family."
bad,"•	Problem solved and resolved the customer’s vehicle concerns. "
bad,I have worked for GM these past 10 years and salary does not keep pace with the cost of living despite a significant boost to productivity in our area of manufacturing. It's just not fair. I will leave in October 2019.
bad,"Compensation, benefits and vaca / holidays were good.  Environment was not good for anyone who is not in their 20's as management showed preferential treatment to anyone who is a new college hire.  Legacy GMers and ex-contractors hired in are treated as if their experience is not valuable, that they are not as intelligent as the younger workers and are often mocked openly for their age.   Innovation trumps common sense.  Users are often left on their own to resolve their IT problems as IT management has left no experienced personnel at the plants."
bad,"Cant believe nobody, and cant trust,even you work hard politic work better.if you work hard no politic you are out from your boss, As long as you stick with managers you gona safe.."
bad,"General Motors is undergoing growing pains as it attempts to become a tech company.  Regrettably, graduated managers with no technical background are firmly entrenched in almost every leadership position of IT spaces.  These resources generally do not contribute materially to the success of General Motors endeavors, but represent the lion's share of the labor costs.  General Motor's commitment to protecting  these old guard resources means that up-and-coming talent must head out the door for opportunity/equitable pay.  General Motors respects legacy above technical proficiency.  Additionally, this aged work force presents significant cultural problems for employees seeking truly innovative environments."
bad,GM was a good place to work until it was not.  Helped them get through bankruptcy and they paid me back with forced retirement.  High stress work environment with limited communication.  Did not know I lost my job until I was being walked out the door.  What ever happened to loyalty??
bad,"Pushes ideology and lacks honest corporate culture. Managers create their own mini-cultures to provide a positive employee experience. Managers have good autonomy to direct employees. Goal oriented, performance minded."
bad,"Management are almost completely disconnected from the workers, oblivious to the actual tasks required. Union cares not for part time/students. Learned how to manage myself, not to trust union and what they promise, as they never deliver. All of the equipment needs repairs in some form. Best part of the job was leaving the warehouse at half past midnight when the shift ended."
bad,"The company has multiple departments, it all depends where you work and who you work with. Personally, the biggest flaw about GM is its babyboomer employees who now are on higher ranking positions and are responsible for the majority of the decision. Because something has always been done in a specific way, they are not willing to change those habits even if it causes major losses."
bad,"The Union management relationship was broken, the workforce distrusted and fought everything, the Union Reps were road blocks and plant staff would take the Unions side against you for doing to them what you were told to do or threatened otherwise. Politics was the only way to promotion and our bonuses and pay were under dispute every year by everyone. "
bad,"This is an Ever Changing , Fast Paced Organization which is very stressful.  Company works in silos, not a place where teamwork is encouraged.  Lack of Leadership, creates much chaos within departments.  Lower level employees are not valued."
bad,I was recently separated from GM in Phoenix - all the Phoenix-based team members were cut.  It looks like they canned around 40% of the entire Phoenix-based staff.  We were all on virtual teams so it really shouldn't have mattered where we sat.  I think there is a lot of opportunity if you are based in Austin and know the right people.
bad,Most stressful 5 years of my life. Poorly managed and unsafe environment to work in. Management cares nothing about your well being and you feel like you have no purpose other then being there for the money.
bad,"GM IT regularly moves people away from their chosen career field without asking the person if they want to move.  I knew several people this happened to, including me.  They do not consider whether the person has the requisite skills or if they would enjoy the work.  A lot of people were unhappy with this."
bad,"diretoria não se importa com os profissionais ,terceiros não querem nem saber ,bloqueiam trabalhadores ,mesmo sabendo que na lei não existe bloqueio, sempre achei a GM , uma empresa onde  davam valor as pessoas ao ser humano,  vi que só dão valor ao dinheiro,não indico a empresa a ninguém que eu conheça, não quero que passem o que eu passei ,sem ter culpa nem uma de um fato que ocorreu !"
bad,"The company as a whole is a good company.  Unfortunately,  the CRM group is lead by folks who have NO BUSINESS in management.  They are clueless when it comes to leadership skills.  Most worked together before GM and have formed relationships that cause them to overlook the deficiencies that are so prevalent."
bad,"No room for advancement"
bad,"Good money, miserable life.  The people and environment are very immature.  It has a high population of low education, and those are the people that create the most issues.  Work hard or find another job, if the foundation on the floor."
bad,"Egocentric back stabbing employees and management, Union provides no support.Stressful work environment was the daily norm and management response was take it or leave it. Never encountered an employer of those standards in 40 years of work history."
bad,The management in my section of the company is scatter brained. There has been a mass exodus and they have changed presidents many times. The management can't get their heads around the decisions and accept insufficient option analysis before moving forward. Because of this they often have to take two steps back. Managers have short term memory loss and you are constantly having to reeducate them.
bad,"7 years was long enough"
bad,The company was not as progressive as it would like to believe it was. I had been there for a year and was assigned a new manager - but she wasn't new. She had been there for 40+ years. Not sure why she was never fired or promoted than a low level manager.  Other things didn't make much sense either.
bad,"GM generally blows, attracts the mentally ill and lazy, and is very happy to underpay and not recognize the efforts of the well-educated and those with a high skillset."
bad,"While to work was demanding, it was not too bad compared to the wages.  But, the management team is dishonest, overly harsh, and will lie to you every day.  Watch your back at all times."
bad,"Typical factory environment. Some management are difficult to appease, others actually do care and appreciate the effort put forth. Fellow drones are great people to work with."
bad,I've never worked for a place that was so unorganized as General Motors.  They do not listen to their workers about what would be best for the product and for work conditions.  I typically went to work and tried to put comments out there for the bosses to implement or for the launch team to do.
bad,Cami is a good paying job but the company itself is a greedy corporation trying to move work to another country! The people you work with make the place alittle better.
bad,"move product through the chain too fast, not enough time to prove out or investigate prior to first trials.   At the end of it all, you do get some good feedback from others.  A good experience."
bad,"The work was very good, but the management was not the most efficient. There were no benefits to being a full time job."
bad,I would work for 8-12 hours a day. The management varies. You never have a manager in your area for more than 4 months and than they switch to a different manager. There is a union and they help you out a lot. I enjoyed having the benefits at work and the pay was great. I didn't like how there was no job security and they treated the temporarily workers horrible. The higher seniority people would do that a lot with the temp workers. I have learned how to build a car . I learned numerous of jobs and how to work in a fast paced area and on a time limit. I also learned how to work on midnight shifts as well.
bad,"No professionalism,hate mongers,female managers donot respect team members and always dictating,too much of micromanagement and no vision for team members ,hard work and dedication is not recognized"
bad,It was a toxic environment where they didn't respect their employees and they were downsizing and moving their production to China and Mexico. I didn't find an opportunity for growth.
bad,"You walk into your cube, power up, clock in, hopefully got your energy drink on hand because you'll need it."
bad,"Don't work here. Sucks the life out of you. If you can find a different job, then by all means do so. It is not worth all the misery. No amount of money is worth being unhappy."
bad,"The position was wonderful and easy for me, but the company did not pay based on experience and skills. "
bad,"The harder you work the worse you're treated. Management is oblivious at best and blatantly asinine at worst. The culture promotes negativity and resentment. Honestly, it was hard for me to see this realization. I took the job to make a difference; yes, the pay and benefits are nice, but at the end of the day I'm miserable there. The hardest part is learning that the only way to make is to look busy and avoid management. I'm ashamed to say American made is no longer the greatest production statement. I'm looking for another job."
bad,"Empresa promedio, no ofrece un balance correcto entre vida laboral y personal, las oportunidades de desarrollo si las hay pero existe mucho favoritismo."
bad,"Micro manage your time.  Pay by minute company.  "
bad,The Union is very bad and they don't really protect you or help you. The union at GM is not needed anymore. The company does not care about their employees. You can cut off fingers and they still want you to come to work. Too many family members work together. They work six days a week and you can never miss work or get sick. Humans get sick and it just isn't a great place to work. Money is good but that's about it.
bad,only hired as a temp worker. easy job and nice managers. very boring work low pay and no job security as the plant was going out of business
bad,"la GM es una escuela un lugar en el una persona puede aprender mucho el detalle es que no es estable de un día a otro se ase re ajuste o paro de linea ademas de que una persona no posee la oportunidad de crecer uno se puede quedar una gran cantidad de meses en el mismo puesto, de modo que no importa cuantos conocimientos o que bueno te ayas vuelto en el trbajo uno se queda donde mismo"
bad,"my typical day was discussing ideas,  issues in meetings with co workers."
bad,Fascinating industry.  Otherwise average.  Different that what many people might think....very much a high tech industry.
bad,"Empresa multinacional com cultura de macro empresa, atrativo principal plr."
bad,"I was responsible for design; development and release of exhaust and air induction system components for all truck lines, and related projects.  I worked with gas and diesel, on both hot and cold end exhausts.  Tests finished product for quality purposes and recommends changes to product specifications as necessary. Mass Analysis.  I worked on aftermarket items as well for various GM SPO projects."
bad,"Classics are always good even on tough times.  Get to work until the money allows you, get to know great people."
bad,cyclical work envirnoment. Poor job security . very competitive
bad,I had really good experience working with people.I was involved in more technical aspects.
bad,Terrible experience. Was used as a stop-gap in manpower so management could delay hiring and placement decisions of full time workers.
bad,"Take a daily inventory of engines and containers, confirm requirements to complete daily shipments, update the shipping schedules as required, issue shipping documents based on load sheets supplied, generate shipping papers for parts and equipment that need to be shipped out for repairs.  Fast-paced environment.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the feeling of accomplishment."
bad,"the benefits are really good, the management sucks, and they put you on whatever schedule they want. probably second or third because all the old people with seniority are on first."
bad,Management need to work on there communication skills. I was looking for a place to retire from. But there is no opportunity for growth with this company.
bad,Experiência nova trabalha lá dentro .gostei muito apredir muita coisa
bad,This company lacks a clear vision about what it wants and what it takes to compete in this industry. There are too many instances of who you know and who you kiss up to regarding advancement.
bad,"Brutal building to work in. Upper management employs old-school leadership practices of badgering, humiliation and cursing at salaried employees to try and ""encourage"" them to do better. As a group leader you are stuck between the upper level of management and the UAW employees with zero support system to help you. They compensate you very well, but even that doesn't offset the ridiculous demeaning culture residing in the building. More tenured employees state it was never that way until the current leadership started taking over 3-5 years ago. Maybe if they leave it will get better??"
bad,"Some management is very rude, and inflexible with hidden personal agendas.  Most of management still uses the old school ideas.    "
bad,...family comes first at gm so if you don't have family members who work in high places there already don't bother or as a last resort.  trust me I had to learn the hard way.
bad,Sucks need more money management sucks lack of getting paychecks on time people just make you frustrated there are many clicks I was a temp full-time with no benefits no sick days just holidays should have got hired in full time that laid off three times
bad,Would be better work enviornment if their management team were better preparred in Diversity Training to better engage with all employees. The benefits that the company offers is excellent but the morale of the company could use a boost.
bad,The supervisors or team leads played favorites and she was very unprofessional. It was like that that pretty much throughout the whole building. The longer you’ve been there the more special or valuable you were. There were a few creepy tech guys that should be fired. Overall not a good environment and the floor is hollow wood so you just hear steps all day.
bad,Management many times doesn't know what they are doing they are more concerned in their well being and they perks that they neglect the people they are suppose to manage.
bad,I have a injured shoulder and currently involved in comp case. The company did not try to accommodate my injury in the 15 years I was on the job. My injury got worse every year I’ve worked and now I cannot use my arm and need complet shoulder replacement
bad,"good pay"
bad,"I contracted for 12 years (they kept promising to hire me). I finally got fed up and left for another opportunity. They contacted me shortly after I left and asked me to interview, so I did. I got the job, worked for 6 more years and was laid off (along with 2400 others) after they hired a number of college students to replace us. They have no loyalty to their employees."
bad,"General Motors hires employees only on a temporary basis, this is to pay low wages and provide very little to no benefits. As a temporary worker at my plant some employees have been temps for almost 10 years now. We are only given 3 days of vacation a year and a terrible medical plan. Unlike permanent employees."
bad,"Too many unseasoned leaders, people getting promoted to leadership over groups in which they have no experience with, or little seasoned experience with."
bad,"All I can say is that you will start as a temp and they will treat you as such.  They will require you to work breaks and lunch and if you so no they will threaten to let you go. "
bad,The jobs pay well.  Unfortunately the jobs are shrinking.  Management strategy is changing rapidly.  Hard to secure your footing from automotive to electrical bikes and boats.
bad,Job roles at GM are very diverse and allow for an individual to steadily progress to different roles according to their interest. GM greatly values the knowledge of its employees and gives the opportunity for continual learning and career growth.
bad,"Not the best company to work for because they don't care about you or your family. The hours are long, and they don't even have a cafeteria to buy food from"
bad,"Typical day building engines"
bad,In general company is fairly old school with lot of bureaucracy. Software development is not the main focus of the company so it sometimes takes a backseat to business needs. Many levels of hierarchy make it difficult to advance. Many that don't understand the actual specifics of software development
bad,"I will give GM that they have good PTO, it ranges from 15 vacation days when you first start to 20 after 2 years. Another bump happens way later, maybe 10 or 20 years. Also a lot of holidays, maybe 15 total."
bad,"Seems like a lovely environment at first until you realize it is another ""Good ole boys club"" and if you just want to do your job and go home they will literally single you out. The hours can be almost abusive and they will use insane company policies as an excuse to corner you or even get rid of you if you don't fit in their club. The union isn't the worst part, it's the management. Great people working for you as well. I will miss my team."
bad,"Everything is supposed to be about seniority but they really have favorites, rules don't apply to everyone. Not really much team work to get job done. People are thrown on jobs w/o proper training and they work us too many hours, no time with family. It SUCKS !!!!!"
bad,The company's culture is average. As a group they seemed too internally focused on their particular department.  In other words I felt each department had 'us' versus 'them' attitude.
bad,You always need to watch your back because you never know who is waiting for the opportunity to step over you to try to make themselves look better. No everyone is that way but I dealt with my share.
bad,"If you have no education, no ambition, no work ethic, no self respect, no respect for others, no integrity, no inclination to improve yourself or to do anything more than the bare minimum and be overpaid for it; then GM is probably a great place for you."
bad,"Not a great culture, no career advancement, very ignorant upper management, some great people working hard here but no passion is shown by the upper management which prevent for the team member to lose passion for the position."
bad,"Even though change is encouraged, management continues to do the same thing, repeat the same mistakes.  They do not encourage, they discourage.  Instead of providing constructive feedback, they do everything to prevent an employee from improving themselves."
bad,"Good benefits, but not worth it against what you would give up for it.  Management only cares about hours and numbers you put in, do not care what employee are put through to get the job done. Very competitive, poor mix of culture, not much knowledge sharing, no time for training, work is pushed down from high above, almost no control over your personal career goals."
bad,I gained more experience and enjoyed my work as a competed and hard working person who is always wiling to learn more  and my dedication to this company
bad,Its all or nothing in this industry. There is an oportunity to make good money and have great benifits but work life balance is nonexistant. You may have a job one day and laid off the next. Its a prety cut throat work inviornment and not very professional.
bad,"Anyone working on the line at General motors will let you know that it is not a place you want to stay for long. It's manual labour and corporate is constantly fighting the union to cut your pay, benefits, and pension. General Motors has a long way to go if it ever wants to provide job security and a work-life balance to its blue collar workers."
bad,Long hours with little concern for personal life. There is very little work life balance. You are expected to put the company before anything else. Little consideration is given to those who have a family.
bad,Overall GM is a good place to work with a great vision and mission statement. Im not sure of every where but where I work micro-management is bad. They say to own your stuff but you are not allowed to. The trust factor is terrible between lower management and upper management. The benefits and pay are good but the culture is terrible and really stressful for no reason.
bad,"This was typical day I constantly busy."
bad,"Job looks great on paper.  Actual job, is walking a tight rope of what to say and what not to say to Dealers, Clients, and GM in house.  If you accept this job, mind your p's and q's."
bad,"I didn't mind the hard work.  Mgmt was in the process of enlarging all the jobs and downsizing the work force.  We (SWEs) were not warmly welcomed by the rank and file of the CAW because we were contractors and not employees.  They thought we had no business having certain jobs; translation: every lousy job should have gone to us.  I was put in the Paint Shop, which is a preferred destination of GM workers because they are considered the easy jobs.  I was covering for a person on long-term disability, but that didn't matter to the people who worked there and they let me know in no uncertain terms that I was not welcome.  They would get upset with me for working too hard.  Their motto is 'save some for the next guy'.  They were in the Paint Shop because they didn't want to work hard and they hated anyone trying to show them up.  That's not what I was intending to do, but SWE's were expendable if they didn't bust their humps."
bad,"While at GM I received good exposure to the automotive industry. My management was supportive and so were my co-workers. However, it was not a very team oriented environment. The hardest part of the job was the lack of job security and the unknown future direction of the company."
bad,"For now and the foreseeable future, stability at GM is not available..."
bad,It was enjoyable to solve problems on all the equipment which I was asked to work on. 
bad,"It use to be a great company to work for. The Indianapolis,IN stamping plant was closed. Many of us lost our jobs and others with high seniority were able to relocate.I worked there for 4yrs and was considered a temp. Once the lay off begun I was let go.."
bad,"Durante o dia de trabalho não eram realizadas atividades muito diferente,o aprendizado que eu adquiri foi senso de urgência para tudo que era realizado,a direção era um pouco distânte dos funcionários salvo algumas pessoas,os colegas de trabalho eram pessoas boas de trabalhar,a parte mais difícil do trabalho eram os dias em tinhamos que alcançar algumas metas que já estavam a alguns dias em atraso,e a parte mais agradável era o trabalho realizado em grupo."
bad,"GM in Marion Indiana was not as efficient as the Indianapolis, In. plant. The stress of this situation was hard. A typical 8 hour day would be 12 hours. Co-workers were knowledgeable and accommodating. I have much more experience and education to bring to a company than I was able to put forth."
bad,"Having worked for GM for the past four years as a temp worker, It is pretty accurate to say that GM has little regard for their temps or making them permanent employees. I was laid off less than a month before I was to become permanent. Be aware that after 30 days of being laid off, you have to start your time over again. Regardless of the newly signed contract, the GM upper management will find away to not hire you."
bad,"All took a pay cut to save GM. Shortly after, all upper management reinstated their pay, and that’s where it ended. Great people work there, but upper management dismiss everyone below, even when they initiate innovative, cost effective and production saving ideals. I personally saved GM countless $ and down time hours, with one change to the clamp trucks, but not even a thank you."
bad,"GM does annual Work Place of Choice survey, which they state is supposed to be an anonymous survey. This is Not True! GM managers use the results to retaliate against their employees."
bad,This job helped me send my children to college. You get discounts on vehicles and health benefits are good. I made a lot of friends and really enjoyed my life with this company.
bad,"Frustrating place to work as people are either ""transitioned"" or leave and are not replaced, but all the work goes to the remaining employees. Very few employees receive recognition for the efforts or skills sets.  No objective promotional criteria.  Salaries can vary greatly for the same skills and years of experience."
bad,If you like factory work GM is for you. Monotonous and mentally draining. Pay is good and benefits are excellent but the work takes a toll on your body.  They want you to work over 55 sec/min and only give 5 min/hour of break time.  Overtime including weekends is expected. Little job security as they are moving majority of work overseas.
bad,"The communication is severely lacking and confused, from all areas of work. The overall work environment is toxic and taxing. The jobs leave you physically sore, drained, and will eventually tear down your body."
bad,"I was very excited and enjoyed my position at General Motors. Until everyone around me started getting fired. Then came my time, I was being harrassed by a fellow co-worker and had two witnesses involved that saw everything unfold. I made a formal complaint to my boss the same day the incident happened. I was fired the very next day without them talking to the witnesses and getting their story."
bad,"This place is very stressful, and has some dumb rules. Don't work here, there very poor work/life balance, and the union doesn't really have your back."
bad,"Most difficult IT environment I have experienced.  Experienced IT team members, with little knowledge of best practices...?  Management is inexperienced."
bad,"Decent place for starting your IT career. Prepare to jump ship in 3 years."
bad,"There's no opportunity to grow. I became bored at my position within months and even though I got ""promoted"" to a higher level on the team, I was doing the exact same work. Even when applying to internal positions, you wouldn't even get acknowledgement that you had applied and would never hear back."
bad,"Its not a bad place to work. The pay is good, the work is easy. Get good benefits and Vacation.  Do not mess up, and you have to take your job seriously."
bad,"I applied for the job at the Romulus facility in August 2016, did my test in October and phone interview in early November; received an email saying I did fine and will get a job offer when they’re ready. Nothing until July 2018 when I was contacted to schedule a drug test. She cut my hair at the neck so when it grows back it looks ridiculous. I passed. Never heard from them. November 2018 received a job offer in my email to start the following week with 1 day to reply. I told them it was too short of notice and would like to try the next orientation. Did orientation then had 2.5 weeks off before getting on the line. Management is terrible, completely unorganized and two-faced no one is on the same page and it’s always a bad feeling like you’ll be fired. They make you sign up for the union your first day but the union is a joke GM has the reps in their back pocket. If you want to opt out though because they do absolutely nothing for you they act as though you’re only employed because of them. Pay/hours are wrong weekly. I was approved for 2 days off (one I switched my day off to accommodate) one of which I had a subpoena to appear as the victim of a crime and when I came back to work was told I was being fired for attendance this week. I still have a job because it was straightened out but needless to say my experience there has been absolutely horrible and I do not wish to return. I would never recommend anyone to work there."
bad,Leadership seems to be focused on new hires and not developing and keeping those that built the company. It has become a very progressive company and there are lots of technologies that you can get involved with.
bad,The co workers were good people formans were good.Upper Management was terrible very unorganized.And let's be real what happened to Union pensions a personal savings program come on GM what happened
bad,On the material side of the plant the management was horrible. No communication or the wrong the communication was given. The Shift Lead and Director of this plant did not care or coach the employee's in the right direction. I left a great Salary and took less of a Salary to get out of this environment created by higher management.
bad,When the plant doesn't close you can work from 8-12 hours a day. Pay is good.  Insurance is good.  Very repetitive work.  As with any place there is good and bad.
bad,It was time for a change... throughout my career at different dealerships I definitely had different experiences. All good learning and life skills to build from.
bad,"The ""assistant buyer"" title is very deceiving as we did not have the power to make any purchasing decisions. The role consists of getting suppliers to return a quote reflecting a price that has already been pre-negotiated by the production buyer. Lots of follow up since suppliers do not like to respond to quotes, and also lots of chasing correct contacts as suppliers have high turnover rates for their account managers. Contract workers are considered ""part of the GM family,"" even though our pay was half of what direct employees receive, with little to no benefits. No job security or room for advancement, and our entire team was laid off with zero notice a month before Christmas. I was fortunate enough to have a good supervisor and co-workers, but that was the only up-side."
bad,"Trabalho em equipe, dinâmica de grupo, trabalho padronizado com desenvolvimento de metas e objetivos que visam o aperfeiçoamento e desenvolvimento do local de trabalho e redução de custo."
bad,"Treat employees unfair. Always low on manpower, will make overtime mandatory so you cant make plans with your family. Doesnt give you enough time to train on a job."
bad,This job is paid weekly and isnt alot of money for part time. They only get like 20 hours if that. The dealership doesnt close on time on weekends usually stay 1 hour or more over for Saturdays and are there 10 hours by yourself.
bad,Business culture heavy. Development and innovation take a back seat to deadlines. Leadership consistently over-promises deliverables to business partners without first consulting development teams.   Look for an actual tech company if you want to work somewhere that is open to using new technologies and methodologies.
bad,"High ratio of new college grads to mid-senior staff.  Top down management with stifling and inefficient processes.  Very political leadership.  Little opportunity for career enhancing projects; lots of busy work.  Many new college hires are placed without regard for fit.  Many mid-senior candidates have had the same experience including myself.  Cost cutting is of upmost importance for IT Innovation, especially with the current cyclical slowdown in the auto market.  No free coffee, drinks or food.  You do get free toilet paper.  No flexible work from home policy.  GM is a strictly work from work environment.  Leadership is very much out of touch with the local IT market.  The company overall is doing well but IT Innovation is at the bottom of the stack for IT jobs in the local market.  I did not know all of this going in."
bad,"Job is physically/mentally demanding. Benefits and pay are good, tuition reimbursement and paid time off. Health and safety procedures are often overruled by union."
bad,"General motors was a very union-minded company even though the offices were not union.  After working at Saab in a very entrepreneurial environment that supported individual input an accomplishments, General Motors was stifling and cold."
bad,"This job is a warehouse facility. You are constantly on the move where you are lifting, bending, stepping up and down, reaching up and down, driving or walking while picking various auto parts that sometimes require you to pack and ship in large quantities into huge shipping crates, that you are required to push when you are a walk picker. These parts can be strenuous because they are also picked and shipped in cases. You can drive by truck if your classification is a crown driver or reach. These departments have the heaviest parts to pick. The job varies so much by the shift you work, however it still requires a lot of physical activity. They usually try to train new hire on the crown trucks first."
bad,"While the pay is excellent there is no job security and the jobs are set up so that your whole body takes a beating.  Lifetime pain is a result of working here.  "
bad,"GM has great individuals that produce good products at competitive prices.  Most individuals have been with the company a long time, and continue to work at doing their best to support that end."
bad,ninety percent of the jobs your not able to keep up with therefore you get yelled at to work harder. Management has no idea what's going on three out of four times. Eighty percent of the people there were friendly.
bad,Working 8 to 16.30 is the only good thing about this job. And of course all the nice people as colleages. Everything else is just not worth a try.
bad,"*produção puxada no auge da produção"
bad,"Ambiente bueno, pero falta de oportunidades para el desarrollo de carrera"
bad,"Not an all inclusive environment, diverse. Management does not encourage diversity and does not discourage abrasive behavior. You will do well as a white middle aged male in this location. I can Not speak for GM as a company over all; only the location in Buffalo NY. I have heard good things about other locations and divisions of the company."
bad,I worked at GM for twelve years in a number of different roles. The pay and benefits are good but not worth the aggravation of dealing with the limiting and frustrating corporate bureaucracy that is so entrenched in GM's culture.
bad,"I worked 2nd Shift in Production/Car frame assembly. Everyday I came in 20 minutes early. Got my work gear ready, made sure to sign up for overtime for the week then replace the 1st shift employee on the job. The job was basically assembling different parts of the car frame and doing quality & safety inspections along the production line. I worked anywhere from 8-12 hours a day and worked thru breaks & lunches for the extra overtime. Worked mostly Monday-Saturday, sometimes only Monday-Friday. I learned alot about the car manufacturing industry, the in's-out's of the union (UAW Local 1714) and the importance of safety in the work environment. Management was very easy to work & get along with. Co-workers were friendly and outgoing for the most part. The hardest part of the job was being kept on ""Temp"" status for the last year so the company doesn't have to pay myself and others benefits, bonuses and health insurance. Also, having to constantly worry about job security because ""Temps"" can be laid-off at anytime; which I am now."
bad,This company is definitely in transition and it will take a lot of hard work and a lot of time for the company to move away from the old way of doing business.
bad,"la mayoría de compañeros son mayores por lo tanto son excelentes personas,son muy cerradas a los ascensos no hay aportunidad para la gran mayoria de colaboradores"
bad,"May not be a bad place to work as long as you aren't responsible for UAW workers.  Most of them are ok, but the minority of radical troublemakers run the place.  "
bad,Some department are fun to work. It depends on the management.
bad,Too much drama...power trip supervisors...no equality for temps....job isn't secure until your hired so they treat you like terrible until then...........
bad,"Job wasn't as good as I thought. Was told I would be working nights but, was put on days for most of the time I worked there. On day shift they did2 work with me in my family issues so, finally I was put on nights but, by that time I had put in my resignation."
bad,"Boa, empresa é  ótima o que deixa a desejar são as mentiras e a falsidades entre os diretores, chefes de áreas com os funcionários  de chão de fábrica, sem falar que o sindicato esta se lixando paras os funcionários, pura politicagem! Vc dentro da empresa é  apenas um número."
bad,"When I started at General Motors years ago, things were looking bright! Leadership was transparent, they promoted a strong work/life balance, growth opportunities for employees, and had a wonderful positive culture. However, since the layoffs in February, all of that changed. Morale is the lowest it's been in years. There is high stress and overbearing workload. Employees are stretched beyond their limits. And the once positive work culture was crushed. I had high hopes for a bright future at GM, however the toxic and stressful work environment has forced me to look elsewhere."
bad,"First time manager, could not see the value of going above and beyond to ensure mistakes were mitigated.  Punished and discouraged for doing so.  Sad to see GM allow this kind of behavior especially after the Ignition switch recall."
bad,"Immediate management is fantastic but as you go up the chain, there is very suspect management. You are a number and the place has no problem keeping people that do not do anything but are in the office and letting go others that work hard but work remotely. I would steer you to look elsewhere."
bad,"Day to day the department I was in would Micro Manage everything that was done.  Managers would rotate out every 2 years, New manager would come in and change all policies. There was never a feeling of security and trust. Promote from within is what they talked about but would rarely let you advance. Always bringing in new engineers right out of school to run programs."
bad,GM does not have regard for its employees.  Employees are just numbers to them.  When it comes to downsizing they only look at how they can immediately save money.
bad,"The force reduction was handled worse than anything I have seen in the 30 years of working in the automotive industry.  This was so poorly handled, I know people that didn't get let go who are now looking for a new job. One person has already quit."
bad,General Motors started out as a blessing for me and my family till they starting closing plants and shipping out work to other countries to make more money.
bad,very cutthroat no advancement lack of care. I would not recommend! no pay no teaching tools. blahblahblahblahblah not a good spot to work. need overhauling
bad,"I read plenty of reviews about this place before accepting the job and thought I could work with the environment despite the common complaints about the place. I didn't realize there was so much truth to the bad reviews. Training is thorough however, process changes constantly and communication about process changes is very poor. Management has too big of teams to provide efficient help to new agents. Everything is about numbers rather than quality. Scheduling is flexible however they are very meticulous when it comes to clocking in/taking breaks even BATHROOM breaks. There is very small windows for being late/early and if you do not adhere you are penalized. Favoritism is a huge part of the office politics and is made apparent almost immediately. They have an insanely high turn over rate and it definitely affects work flow and work load making it very hard on the agents."
bad,"GM has a habit of placing individuals in job roles that they did not apply for. "
bad,"the environment was intense, though the pay was good but you are not sure what happens the next day, no matter the effort you put in the job...i think the management reserves the job mostly for their family members"
bad,Would be a great pace to work but for a few things. The jobs are not over bearing but some employees have to work a lot harder than others which can be taxing and cause injuries. There needs to be more flexibility to move people around from time to time which would cut down on injury and medical leave. Attitudes among long time employees need to change because it pulls moral down. Plant wide quality is not a top priority which needs to change also. For the most part the culture of the tenured worker needs to change.
bad,"can be a good place to make money but they expect you to live the company. If you do not mind living the company a good place to work. "
bad,It was great fun working to build Cars but lacking the coordination in various departments. Much of the Company systems are hidden & not much is trained in this front.
bad,Expect to work during vacations and be called at any time day or night. The only thing keeping me here is the benefits and pay. It is hands down the most toxic and disorganized work environment I've ever been a part of.
bad,"Boa empresa para conhecer como funciona uma produção de grande escala, mas muitos chefes despreparados para gerenciar pessoas, utilizando de assedio moral para fazer os funcionários  trabalharem  mais."
bad,GM is a fast paced environment with constant change to keep up with the automotive standards. The product that they produce is a high quality good product that reaches out to all age brackets.
bad,"first thing was to check that everyone in my group was at work , if not I would do their job until someone come to cover the job. I would take toque checks and record the results. THE workers in my group were good workers and I would give them extra breaks when I had the chance to show my appreciation. The lower level management were good to work with although we did have to deal with some group leaders that had no idea about the jobs we did.The hardest part of the job was trying to get things fixed properly i.e. hoists ."
bad,"No Work/Life Balance due to heavy workload. Unreasonable management. Low morale due to management."
bad,A great career opportunity to develop sales skills using encouragement and motivation to improve business processes in fixed operations customer service.  Leadership is essential in this position to motivate service drive behavioral change.
bad,"Unfortunately I had a horrible experience at General Motors, but I do believe they have great opportunities. Benefits are amazing: fairly decent pay, discounts on a wide variety of consumer products & services, travel discounts, 401k investment matching, annual bonuses, etc. While that was all great.... I hated my position. My team was divided internally; they were very ""click-y"". ""Old timers"" or ""lifers"" don't seem to care for new young employees for one reason or another unless they blindly follow. There are no opportunities to do any real design for electrical engineers; all design is done on the supplier end and the OEM sets the specifications so it's more like project management. There are 3 major lanes for engineers: Post Development, Current Development, and Advanced Development. To change from one lane to the next is almost impossible."
bad,"I'll keep it short since others have basically said the same thing. Management says that there is a ""collaborative"" and a ""transparent"" culture, but the reality is that it's all about who you know. The environment is very incestuous (inwardly-focused) and typically, if you don't fit the profile of what they are looking for in terms of you viewing politics and position as being far more important than excellent ideas that can help the company, then you will not advance, and may even be forced out."
bad,"The GM workforce includes far too many people working under contract for numerous years without a chance to be hired in. This means that people are doing the same job working next to each other making less than half of their co workers. Benefits are decent, but their is no room for advancement and you find yourself answering to 8 different bosses all of which have no idea what you actually do."
bad,"I started working there as a Customer Relations Specialist. There was an intense five week training period. Assisting different customers made for an interesting day. I was quickly promoted to the legal correspondence department. Since we were handling legal concerns, dealing with customers became more dull. Since attorneys and courts were involved, building rapport with customers was not our objective."
bad,"Unless you like being caught in the constant fight between union and management its best to avoid working here. Company culture is rotten to the core and I don't know if can be fixed. Both sides are equally to blame and neither want to do anything to fix it. Pay and hours were typical and the workload wasn't overwhelming. Definitely some interesting projects to work on opportunity to spit out ideas. Just don't attempt to implement anything that involves labor. Never spoke to a soul outside of work hours  where I've made friends for life at every other company I've worked for. A good steeping stone for those looking to gain experience in the automotive field, just don't by in to either sides rhetoric about the others."
bad,Worked for GM IT for 3 years out of college. Started out fast paced with a lot of on the job training with minimal direction from management. After awhile everyone who worked there seemed unhappy about the lackluster work culture. It had good compensation and was a great opportunity out of college but I wouldn't go back.
bad,This day and age they do not want to hire full time people. I was promised full time status in a contract since I have 4 years in as a temp as 48 other people just for them to lie and fire us all right before Christmas. They do not care about you or your family. You are just a number. Dont waste your time working here
bad,"Pay and benefits are good but management does not care about their employees and always threatened with closure. Constant stress, feels like management always wants to fire you."
bad,"Though well paid with my salary, the number of hours put in are atrocious. For the past year, 60+ hours have been the norm, and more + than 60. I don't know that every part of GM IT is like that, but I've worked in 3 positions, and they were all pretty much the same."
bad,"It wasn't too bad until they started walking people out of the building this week.  Every few minutes someone else was tapped on the shoulder, given a packet and escorted out the door (about 15% according to news reports).  Some people openly weeping, very cruel."
bad,"The hardest part of working at GM is the frustration of a big company.  Things do not move fast and they believe they always have a better way to do something.  Need to manage emotions constantly.    "
bad,Too much competition within my workgroup to outdo each other. Stressful environment environment. Sexist attitudes. Employees not treated as an important part of the company.
bad,No growth at least to the employees in Atlanta. Most of the lead or management positions are in Austin or Detroit. They don't want to delegate any work to Atlanta.
bad,easy going and love what I did it was easy work environment worked with great people but at times it could be hard especially cleaning the basement it was hard and sweaty at times
bad,They allow plenty of shut downs so you can travel alot. Air conditioned plant some job are overloaded and it could take a while for you to get hired.
bad,"great compensation, but, you have to start out as a temp, and remain a temp for sometimes years!"
bad,"Buen lugar de trabajo, experiencias basicas , buenos compañeros y limpieza"
bad,They are really good at ensuring all employees have training for their specific job roll. They also like to promote within if your willing to learn new positions.
bad,money was great working with all the wonderful people.  the company itself was like many others they wanted a lot of work for as litte money as possible
bad,"GM was ok place to work but unless you are a superstar, career advancement is limited especially for old workers. Was moved to new position with no opportunity for input as to job fit or choice. Forced out due to age."
bad,"Hard work. Laborious, but thats what you sign up for. doing the same thing every minute 220 times a day isn't the greatest, but it paid the bills and for that I'm thankful. Hard on your body, repetitive movements, and they don't care about you in there. If your injured they don't believe you, but again, thats just other people ruining it for the ones who are actually hurt. Honestly, GM as a company is ok I guess, its the people who run it and you work with that suck and have made it worse for everyone else. "
bad,"It's a temp job.  Some temps have been there 3+yrs.  They move you around so much, it's hard to learn and be good at a job.  They work their people to death, at least the new temps."
bad,"Stressful and scary. "
bad,"Great starter job"
bad,It was a great to work when it was up and running but with plant closing its gone down hill. I would show up and when shift started i would work the line and fill racks with automotive parts to be shipped to parts of gm. I would stop for 2 10 min breaks and a 20 min lunch when they were complete I would go back to the line to continue to work and would leave at the end of the day.
bad,"IT Management has no clue how the IT projects work."
bad,"Upper management makes poor decisions to make them look good on paper but disregard company motives/policies. I thought this would only be true at the first plant I worked in but transferred and saw the same management. Backstabbing, lies, and personal feelings/perception rule decision making and employees raises and bonuses. My current plant blatantly disregards written HR policy to the point that it has effected raises and even had some employees fired."
bad,Great employee benefits.  Several meetings per day allows for little time at your desk to do your day to day tasks.  Lower level management selfish with their own progress rather support their subordinates.
bad,"Learned alot about vehicles manafacturing, management was extremely poor, no hnads on approach to dealing with issues. Workplace culture varies on the day and whether co workers want to be polite or not."
bad,"Great people to work with."
bad,"As a material handler, observing for good quality parts was very imperative. I learned to follow strategic processes to make sure that the quality of parts were up to expectations."
bad,This place is a good place to work if you need the extra money and hours. There are all type of bonuses and incentives. The environment is very busy and loud.
bad,"From 2002-2010, GM Lordstown was just not a good place to be.  Favortism designated who would progress and who would not.  Leadership team lacked vision and could not see potential.  As a result, many good people left and went on to better places with more opportunity."
bad,"Very fast paced.  24/7 expectations."
bad,Not the best use of my skills. Spent more time putting stickers on machines and appeasing egos than actually fixing computers. All technical work was pushed to EDS.
bad,"Logistics overview"
bad,una empresa muy importante la cual se preocupa por la seguridad de los trabajadores ademas de proporcionar cursos de mejora continua y de calidad total una empresa q maneja seguridad por observacion preventiba en la cual es muy faCIL DESARROLARSE Y HACER UNA CARRERA DE EXITOS
bad,"In the short time I have been there has been fast paced and exciting. My co-workers are fantastic, everyone is willing to lend a helping hand."
bad,"Highlights in infotainment/telematics and engineering management:"
bad,"Did not build competitive products and did not take competition seriously until too late, needed new products."
bad,"trabalhar na GM foi bom para o meu conhecimento e aprendizagem, sendo uma muitinacional, aprendi diversas funçoes e conheci amigos q ate hje continuam entrando em contato comigo,"
bad,"Friendly environment, and stimulating intillectually. Regional Office is an a second-rate building, however. Horrid cafeteria where soup is the only viable option."
bad,Negatives-
bad,service all Ford makes and modals of vehicles.
bad,"Highly sought after product requiring lots of dedication of time and work from employees. A fair amount of ""employee recognition"" on paper, but not in daily interactions. Standardized work is emphasized as well as safety. Quality is promoted as a top priority."
bad,People work long work days some without a descent break.  Machines running until shift is over. One is standing on their feet from the start of the shift until it ends.  Lunch breaks are from 20 to 30 mins. One works in cold and hot conditions in the planet.
bad,"Works for some, but not for me. It is all a matter of personal preference. Glad I took the job to learn what I don't like and want out of a company or work culture, although it does vary department to department in a company that large."
bad,There are advanatges and disadvantages to management at my location. The benefits are excellent  but its trade for the workplace culture. There can be room for advancment but itis limited
bad,"Acho uma empresa magnífica com salários e beneficios excelentes,  um trabalho dinamico , porém a empresa não está desenvolvendo sua liderança ,  a liderança está parada a anos já sem plano de carreira e desenvolvimento adequado para o os dias de hoje .  Mais    e uma excelente empresa para se trabalhar ,grupo de pessoas muito unido infelismente  está passando por uma reestruturação ."
bad,"Very great place to work if you can move at a fast pace."
bad,Each day clean all men's washrooms and locker room. Plus be on call for emergency clean ups .
bad,"Muita segurança para desenvolver o trabalho, a empresa oferece boas condições para desenvolver o serviço, havia uma boa comunicação com a liderança e com os colegas de trabalho e a parte mas dificil do trabalho era o horário. "
bad,"I ran machines, and problem solved when parts were not running correctly. I learned how to gage parts and do small repairs. As well as learning other jobs as well."
bad,Working as a contractor at GM isn't that great. You are forced to take unpaid days throughout the year. The only point of working as a contractor is to impress management enough to get hired as a full time GM employee.
bad,"The customers for the Cafeteria were great, management for the cafeteria was awful, very high security, very relaxed environnement"
bad,the company was wanderfull to work for plenty of over time easy to get along with coworkers I enjoyed my work experience
bad,"Was a business that cared about its employees,now its all about cutting jobs,and profits!"
bad,The downfall of the place is management they really sucks especially if they are new trying to hard to prove they are worthy and nothing stays the same its always switching up
bad,"Teria uma avaliação excelente se não fosse o fato de terem demitidos 300 funcionários em massa sem ter selecionado entre estes os que possuíam um bom histórico, simplesmente decidiram por afastar em layoff os funcionários prometendo que ao termino do layoff todos retornariam e ao termino desligou todo mundo."
bad,They train you for a little over a month but they try and cram Everything there is to know about a vehicle. Imagine not knowing anything about vehicles and then try and learn it times 5. You deal with a lot of angry and rude service guys and the customers are always upset. Not so great.
bad,"A good manager will earn the respect of the employees he/ she is managing. You have to be able to solve problems and sometimes counsel troubled employees. I have helped many employees through my employment with general motors. The culture today is not what it was. It has changed as to political correctness which I am against. However, I can explain the situation and people can see my point of view. I do not try to change a person but to respect other people's point of view. What most managers forget is people come from different cultures and environments which i believe has an effect on the divide this country is in.. Managers must realize behavior is life experiences.When you have employees that go out of their way then you know you are doing the right thing as a manager. I give chances then warnings before i discipline. The big problem is your manager that you report to. In unions they want you to be hard and discipline without any chances to the employee. Employees have bad days just like everyone else. I have seen good employees become bad employees because of upper management. They want grievances to settle write ups against management. The employees is affected by this kind of management which will effect output and the manager has no respect with the employees."
good,Day starts early with week generally consisting of meetings.  Email reviews and updates during evenings along with presentation development for upcoming reviews.
good,"Company works around the clock, days are long and nights are longer.  Compensation does not fare for the position if you are not an hourly employee..."
good,"I work with some of the best guys that I have ever worked with, they took me under their wing and taught me so much.  I really haven't had much of an issue with this place except I believe being a woman in this work place is either good or its bad.  They either hold that against you or they use that to help you."
good,Importante para o desenvolvimento pessoal e a qualificação do atendimento ao cliente.
good,"While the company overall is great, the culture in the DC office is poor.  Little opportunity for growth and very little support. It is a very unpleasant culture."
good,aprendi a soldar partes del carro
good,"Provide exceptional customer service  "
good,I saw a lot of Interns and Apprentice come and go.The permanent staff in limerick only makes up about half the workforce. Training and support is poor. It is not a good learning environment for the Interns and Apprentices.
good,"The place was a rat hole from start to finish, was a temp and was made aware of my status daily. Always received comments about pay inequality by full time shop rats."
good,"No work/life balance"
good,"Served food within different departments of the facility, nightly cleanings, and nightly cash deposits."
good,DONT DO IT!!! HORRIBLE. They lay off way too much and too easily it not stable or job security is not guaranteed. Dont want to worry about if you will have a job tomorrow and the long hours you sometimes have to work. flexibility is poor
good,"I learned it's a fast pace job and requires a lot of energy,willpower, and function. The hardest part of the job is,your physical body can get burned out. Your co-workers are enjoyable to work with and management changes and shifts occassionaly, Overtime can be manditory and it helps having a bigger paycheck. The way the econony is today this job would help a lot of people get out of some debt and benefit in a lot of ways."
good,"working at gm was fun for the most part, given the team you are working with. almost everyone was very helpful and motivated too hit our daily numbers. the down fall of this company was finding out about the closure."
good,"Average place to work. You'll always make $15 less an hour than the guy next to you on the line. No paid time off, rotating shifts. No surprise its closing."
good,You have to pay union dues but do not have the same protection as a permanent person your rate of pay is low for the work you can only survive by working at least 16 hours of OT a week. No paid vacation or sick days while a temp for 2 straight years if you are laid off and called back the time reset
good,"They often switch contracts to the cheapest bidders and are not actually involved in the day to day process, poor management tells employees not to directly speak to GM. Poor management is overlooked. The company does not treat the employees well."
good,"There's nothing fun about working for General Motors as a temporary/flex worker. You are basically there to cover for the seniority workers who may decide they don't wanna come to work that day or maybe for the week. They train you on many jobs as they can so that they can flop you around at any given time as needed, and they expect you to learn those jobs within 3 days time. There is no respect for temps in GM at all no matter what your background is, they only care about keeping the line running. Temps are being used and abused and they have nothing to look forward to. You get no benefits like the hired in full time workers, only thing a temporary get is halfway health insurance, paid Holidays and three days of in a year and you have to apply for those and wait about two weeks for an approval. If you get sick or somehow broken your arm or leg you cannot call in Lol, you actually have to come in and be seen by their Ice nurses because there is no actual Doctor on the premises. I call them ice nurses because that's all they do apply ice packs to your swollen fingers you gotten from doing the repetitive work in there."
good,This place is wonderful if you are single. It makes it very hard to be with family working six days a week as a temp. And getting little to no time off.
good,Ok place to  not much potential to grow  fast pace long hours 6 days week...................manger hard to work forpay decent you get 30 minutes  to eat
good,if your looking for a lot of heavy work then this is for you and possible working 6 days a week some mandatory overtime you have to take in the locations and where you live it could be a good place to work it depends on the person this is an assembly plant of trucks and vans your  will be doing a lot of labor work and there most of your time
good,Stressful environment....never know when your last day is gonna come .very hard to maintain a mortgage or a car note when your future is always just a layoff away. Pay was good considering some employees made double than others.
good,The culture is very negative due to the company downsizing and it shows in all the employees. No feedback from upper management and no room for advancement.
good,"It is challenging phase in Cadillac. Trying to achieve a lot with little support. It has the start-up/small company vibe; however, it has a lot of growth potential with the right management"
good,"Management needs to spend some time at the plants, on the plant "
good,"You are a second hand employee as a temp, and less than that within the first 90 days. Pay is good! UAW is worth it... After the 90 days! Great team atmosphere! Hard work for the first month or so, but if you can whether that, it's just work."
good,The union and management never looked for their workers only themselves. We worked six days a work that was made mandatory which was against union rules that was overlooked.
good,Management of production workers very poor.Lack of qualified supervisers who can motivate work force to do effecent quality work. Poor production practices and quality control issues. over all very negitive invironment to work in. Employee moral very low
good,"Need to reach bus stop very early so difficulty to maintain work life balance."
good,Performed all office clerical duties as needed for department along with scheduling meetings and appointments for managers in charge.
good,"It was only for three months, but I did enjoy the people I worked with."
good,"The job itself was actually quite fun and has a lot of potential to become something worthwhile, due to the closure the atmosphere is completely demolished. Everyone there is bitter and sometimes quite rude. Some of the team leaders are quite alright though most of them are very belittling if you're trying to learn something new and make mistakes. There is almost no room for error and they throw you right into the wolves. You must learn fast and adapt faster. Unless you are a full-time worker you essentially get no benefits and to become full-time you have to be working there for a minimum of 4 years and be on a waiting list. Overall the job itself was fun but lack of leadership and guidance may not be worth it depending on the individual. The hours are 40 guaranteed every week but it's a day shift (6:00am-2:00pm) for two weeks then an afternoon shift (2:00pm-10:00pm) for two weeks"
good,Don’t work here if you want to have a life. The mandatory overtime gets real old and there is no relief. The management doesn’t notify people in time for people to plan activities outside of work.
good,Empresa onde tive a oportunidade de crescer e aprender profissionalmente e pessoalmente.
good,Most of the people I worked with were experts and provided advise that was very helpful. The hardest part of the job was a few suppliers who had difficulty managing their deadlines and requested too many extensions.
good,"Work was fun and at times rewarding.  The general employee - the worker bees were easy, fun and at the same time hard working individuals.  I was given plenty of opportunity to enhance/improve upon my skills. "
good,"Trabalho é árduo, trabalho é bastante desenvolvido em equipe, a direção tem um método de intimidar os colaboradores, a cultura é bem forte, o início é mais difícil, colegas agradáveis."
good,"Recentemente passou por uma forte mudança cultural, de ambiente que motivava o respeito ao cliente e o desenvolvimento do produto, para uma cultura de obediência e controle comportamental; algo semelhante a uma seita."
good,"Very fast paced work need the ability to learn tasks quickly. Absolutely no job security, NO set work schedule, 10-12 hour days 5-6 days a week, very little chance of job advancement."
good,"Work environment is very variable. There are very good managers and others not that good. Job security is an issue recently."
good,I enjoyed my time working at General motors as a temporary employee. I established some personal friendships and I was able to see my effectiveness in leadership. The hardest part of being a temporary employee was not to be included in profit sharing and other benefits that regular employees received. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning how the company works as a whole.
good,"Its a ok job. you might never be, on full time. Very quick to lay off or fire. Little job training but company expect you to learn a job in 1 hour, but policy says 72 hour on a job. Not highly recommended.The union will not support part time workers even if you pay full union dues. They will throw you under the bus."
good,"Leadership talks a very inspiring and motivational talk.  Unfortunately their actions are not usually aligned with their talk.   There are have been culture change seminars, discussions of empowering teams and individuals with more autonomy, etc...  All sounds very good,  but when it comes to executing the proposals - everything changes."
good,"does not promote from within, poor management styles who hires friends instead of qualified candidates. The company does not know what kind of culture it wants. It wants to cater to the young IT culture but GM doesn't want to change."
good,there are next to no opportunities for advancement I don't like staying stagnant in my career I would like to move forward to create better opportunities for my family.
good,It's not glamorous but it pays the bills. It's not something that I want to do long term. It is simply a means to an end. But it does pay lots of over time.
good,"Long work days, benefits became worse after change in management, management isn't helpful, everyone has a lack of work ethic, loved job before new management took over"
good,Would never work again in a plant environment.  Everything is geared to getting the completed parts out the door. It was a dog eat dog environment.  All X-type managers.
good,Good company to work for if you like to move around the country and relocate your family every 3 years.  Very hard on a family and very costly to the employee
good,"General Motors does not value there employees."
good,The management has no idea what they are doing they just want to push through cars. I don't think the main office has a clue of what actually happens on the floor. It is very hard to get permanently hired and even then you still get laid off.
good,The GM company Serbia was not a nice place to work because the Menagement was very bad and everybody did what they wanted and the salery was always up to 2 weeks behind.
good,"Overworked and underpaid.  When problems come up, a lot of time is wasted working harder and not smarter.  Inexperienced engineers will have you (technicians) going around in circles to satisfy them.  And if you make a mistake  or don't make their grade, you'll be threatened with loosing your job."
good,"I enjoyed working for GM.  They had many good people, but the opportunities were few and the pay was not as competitive."
good,Poorly run company with disengaged workforce.  10% of management and 20% of Union needs to be let go for poor performance.
good,Ok  place to work for . daily activities always the same very stable enviroment .
good,"Infelizmente a GM do Brasil utiliza contratações, em grande parte, por empresas terceiras (eu era contratado de forma terceira), e com isto os funcioários são pouco valorizados."
good,Overall good to work if you wAnt work life balance else it’s a mess not sure what else but overall good company but less pay come o e   Nnftfjhghj dhnctyficustkc cudciycyiitdyiiy yofiyckyfkyck fkhcigcihckyfitciycjgcgkcjgcjyxihxticykcykxykcgkcykdiyfoydityfihcohdkhxjyu
good,"Majority of UAW workers and 95% of labor management are sneaking, behind your back when you are not around talking bad about you. Management always picks and plays who they like and dislike as far as treatment of their employees. You speak up on issues and tell the truth to them, they do not like the truth and you are a target with some hourly employees and all of management. Hard work and taking pride on your job by going well beyond your job duties at GM does not always get noticed or a certificate of award appreciation if you are not in the buddy system with management, union or other employees. Lazy workers by gender and race that squeak the loudest get taken care. Meaning they brown nose management get special treatment because management does not want the ***** breathing down their neck by discriminating against race and gender. Federal Government has a quota to meet on race and color of employees for employment, so they get a payment kickback for meeting requirements by the government. Hard work and going well beyond your job duties get you nowhere in promotion or you miss something or your job management wants to put you on notice and most of the time discipline you by throwing you out of work for a day, two days, week, two weeks, three weeks, thirty days and last termination. Management holds hard and good workers to higher standards because they expect almost perfection and when you make a mistake that is almost unacceptable. Average and lazy workers that come in to work or miss work and make mistakes daily and weekly to collect paycheck with little or no care about"
good,"Working at GM onstar was difficult, they fire people constantly with no reason, shortage of staff, bar rota management, very vary management, bulling and harassment, do not respect people. Team leaders use drugs, managers disrespectful and also with cultural bias."
good,NÃO pensa nos pais de família que dava  o sangue pela empresa e demitiram um monte de pai de família sem motivo algum só porque só pensa em ganhar dinheiro
good,"Management was not in touch with what was reqired to perform your duties, not enough thought put into the request of the tech. They did not support the need for information that would expedite the request that they made."
good,"The job its self is easy to do but it gets boring and repetitive. Pay isn't great and competitors make more. Benefits are great. Some work from home days which is a nice perk. General Motors side of job is great, but the contractors who are the managers can be hard to work with."
good,"Culture is extremely competitive and cut throat."
good,stressful environment and terribLe shift hours. Union workers do not help like they ate suppose too either. The only good thing about this job is the Healthcare benefits.
good,"Work culture is bad, no Job security you are expected to work like donkey if you are on international projects, you need to call into the meetings at night and also on weekends, benefits are ok not world class like other companies."
good,Spent 6 years at GM and could not tolerate the discriminatory practices by some managers. Every day was drudgery and so demeaning. Managers proud that they beat you up in meetings. Absolutely no respect!
good,"Throughout my time at GM there were constant Re-orgs and now they're going through a massive layoff that no one know's how and when it will start, so morale has been really low."
good,"I was hired as a temporary employee and was shocked to find that their were at least 10 - 2 year temp workers and more being hired every month. Regular workers have better work situations than temps. Temps are forced to work weekends as well as any OT needed, no yearly bonuses and 3 days off a year including sick days."
good,"The GM Proving Grounds is a great place to work. The job itself isn’t hard at all. The facilities need some care and updating. Safety and quality at/in are valuable. There’s a lot to learn and participate in however the political aspect is damaging. It can be an “in-club” atmosphere and unfortunately the “ole boys” who know how to manipulate the system tend to be the guys who cause the most damage. No one should ever come into work feeling targeted for the opportunity they received. Management doesn’t see the real problem going on. The guys who sit back and run their mouths to the boss are the guys who have never really worked a day in their lives. They keep the pot stirring so any negative attention remains on the chosen few who do not fit in. It’s controlling and it’s not right. What’s not okay for one employee can be okay for someone else. It really depends on who has power to protect your backside. It’s wishy-washy depending on the situation and who’s there to have the final say. I’m disappointed because there’s so much opportunity there however management has their own agenda. For a place that doesn’t understand what hard work really is, they definitely have it made there."
good,Learned a lot of mechanical skills. The work culture was terrible with a shutdown always over your head thank god they offered a buyout. Too many overpaid older workers taking advantage of being in a union that was really not interested in looking out for the workers.
good,"GM is a top-heavy company where no one wants to rock the boat. Unless you work in Michigan there is no career advancement opportunities. Very hard for anything to get done due to complicated processes. Always acknowledges that IT works in silos and how they want to break them down, but in the end"
good,"I was there during the transition from Americredit Financial Services to GM Financial. The culture changed immensely. It wasn't bad; just different."
good,"Mucha política para obtener una posición permanente, aunque poseas fuerte conocimiento contable depende mucho de las relaciones con los supervisores para que te permitan obtener un puesto permanente."
good,"This company is very cut-throat. It is definitely a ""what have you done for me lately"" work place. Advancement is available, if you know the right people. They preach a ""family"" environment but when it comes down to it, it is every man for himself. You definitely earn everything you get because no one is looking out for you."
good,Union is not what they used to be years ago at gm. They don’t fight much for you and are very close with gm management. They keep you as a temp longer and longer to save money and you are required to work every day with only 3 unpaid days off and no benefits or profit sharing but they expect you to pay union dues. Starting wage is also lower which is a bummer. Please change your processes or you will turn gm into just like every other company.
good,No room to move unless want to go to Michigan and not even much there.  Coworkers are great but management leaves alot to be desired.  Not all bad but if highly driven beware.
good,Oppressive dictatorship with no respect for others. Daily morning meetings required for beat down/harassment. Typical day included at least 2 reprimands for events that were out of supervisory control
good,No home life. Work you to death or you quit. Company hires you to try and fire you. Don't get sick. Benifits are okay but could be better. 6-7 days a week.
good,I have been a contract supervisor for over a year and have make numerous improvements to receiving but still have not been hired in full time. Productivity does not matter when it comes to working here which makes it tough stay motivated when you are not rewarded for your hard work and time.
good,Worked as vendor developemt engineer . Good experience while working. Have to handle all activity independently. Good company to grab knowledge. Great experience.
good,GM power train seems to not care about their technicians. They work their Technicians long hours with no appreciation for them. They do not promote people based on skills and abilities. Over all a very frustrating place to work.
good,"La empresa y sus productos es Buena desgraciadamente los administradores no lo son no hay oportunidad de desarrollo a menos que tengas una muy Buena recomendación. Existe mucho la subcontratación por empresas manpower etc, quienes les dictan las maneras como hacer las cosas."
good,I have learned that this is not the culture that I want to work in. The best part of my job is the paycheck.High stress. Jobs are bad on your body.
good,"The General Motors Centre not GM. Just a bad place to work, no room to move up and very little hours. Management will lay you off without any notice, no breaks and poor paid. Management picks who will move up."
good,"Hostile outside environment in SW Flint, MI. Very dangerous neighborhood. No city services from the City of Flint. Fire and police service unavailable at most times. Unable to drink the water supplied "
good,"Aprendi muito durante os quinze anos que me dediquei exclusivamente a empresa ,apdicando muitas vezes de minha própria família .Adorava o meu trabalho e fiz muitas amizades ."
good,build vehicles and work on assembly and sub assembly lines common knowledge of safety rules and regulations how to work many different types of machinery and be productive in a very fast paced work place
good,"Es una fabrica que no toma al operario como persona, sino como un numero"
good,Unskilled supervisors instructing tradesmen. Company work life welfare entitlement system. Sleeping co- workers. Company limits employee knowledge's and usefulness. No chance of advancement. Military structured.
good,"Ambiente de trabalho razoável, de positivo a interação com o publico, não havia treinamentos."
good,Its been a few years since I have been there. I was there before the fall from grace. experience depends on where you are in the organization.
good,"They were right when they told me it would be the easiest serving job you would ever have.  Not having any previous serving experience, I still think that notion is correct.  It is an easy night time job to get you some extra cash.  You aren't guaranteed a large tip, but if you are friendly and get their desires quickly, you can encounter some pretty generous people."
good,"Meet up with co-workers and Supervisor at start of shift, listen to the job quota of the day and what happened on the shift before yours. Got assigned a different job each day. Learned a good hard work ethic. Co-Workers did not care about the job but more about your personal life. Hardest part was getting the job done in the time they requested. Most enjoyable part of the job was learning all the different types of jobs that were available."
good,work not hard but it was hard to get time off. lots of overtime available
good,"Very cut-throat environment. Management is unapproachable, very short-sighted and has corporate amnesia. Poor pay for contractors."
good,"al llegar solo nos saludábamos las personas que trabajábamos en la misma zona y a trabajar para cumplir con los itinerario de ese día, los supervisores solo daban indicaciones y eran prepotentes en general se trabaja bien."
good,"Typical day involves constant communication with buyers, suppliers, designers, program managers and other engineers. I work in a very dynamic group with a lot of talented individuals."
good,I worked at General Motors Canada in Oshawa for over three years as a Universal Replacement. The demands for some of the working conditions and jobs you are required to do are not safe or sufficient. You are required to do jobs that you may not have an idea about or knowledge of. Bosses make you feel like your job is on the line if you do not do it in a timely manner.
good,"Já foi a melhor empresa do estado, agora com a nova diretoria se tornou a pior, está perdendo todos talentos, o diretor estimula a briga entre colegas, "
good,"The people you work with are good down to earth people. The schedule wasn’t bad, everything is based off seniority. Good bonuses if you are not a temporary employee"
good,"It's factory life and with it comes what feels like a dead end. And if you are okay with that then you might just like it. Overall GM is a good place to work if you just want to go in do your job and get out and want nothing else as in job responsibilities. A typical day for production is going to the break area and waiting for the schedule of what parts we are going to run on our shift and then look at the rotation sheet and go the spot either to make tags, check a panel, or load stamped parts and rotate so no one is doing the same thing for more than 30 minutes or an hour. Thats it. Nothing special or interesting about it. And repeat that every day.  Every day <-(thats no typo). The benefits are great and so is the pay, but it can be a trap, because nothing will probably ever come close to it without a degree and so you might just stay put and not take anymore chances. But it is a very unpredictable business and with it comes the other misery; not knowing when you will have a job and if you do, how long will it last before layoffs or rumors of it start coming around. If you want to advance, you might as well forget about that possibility, because GM wants 4yr grads and on the union side its not something you discuss. You really just become a robot and you start to feel unappreciated and you wonder if they (management) even notice your work. But if you don't want to advance and not care if you're making a difference then this could be the place for you. Make sure you have some type of music to keep you sane."
good,The company always laid off multiple times a year. Three days after i told my manager I was pregnant I had disciplinary action taken against me. I started off on third shift making $17.32
good,Las prestaciones que brinda la empresa son un poco deficientes tanto como el cuidado del personal.
good,was supposed to be switche to a new station after each break and i was not. was very hot in the summer and my station did not have a working fan like the others did and took forever for a new fan
good,"First off I've been a temp worker for more than 4 years and my pros and cons are as follow"
good,"Poor management, wrong metrics being used to measure performance. No plan to fix long term problems. No standardized work. Flying blind. Higher leadership in place due to who their parents were in company before."
good,"Very repetitive work for team members. Team leader us more versatile. I had to be proficient in 23 different jobs on my line. Was also responsible for doing repair work, as well as keeping my teams area clean, stocked and efficiently running during my shift."
good,"Para quem tem espírito de político brasileiro, é um bom lugar para treinar seus dotes."
good,Boa empresa para se trabalhar onde produtividade metas e objetivos são levados a risca.otimo conceito de processos com produtos de ponta.
good,"Its a good part time job. Because it is temporary and usually there is a layoff. I have been a temporary employee for 3 yrs and only 2 raises due to the layoffs. "
good,By me being a temp employee I was not offered many of the perks & incentives that the permanent employees were offered. They had temps who has been there for several years but refused to hire them in permanently.
good,not much to say about gm as of now as its pretty new but the work culture is not very good. so far looking to get the est - will see how it all works out !
good,They provide no loyalty to the employees to you must truly look out for yourself.  Not that you shouldn't but a company should still somewhat lookout for employees who dedicate their's and their family life to them.
good,Great place to start a career and determine your best next steps in career moves. Plenty of room to move internally but you have to have a high-level leader on your side or you can get stuck in a job and growth will be limited.
good,"There was no room for job advancement. The job was the same thing day after day after day.  My manager was not very helpful when asked questions. Also, the changing shifts every 2-3 weeks was very hard to handle."
good,"A typical day at GM consists of working 8-10 hours a day, answer many emails, 2-3 meetings per days, resolve issues, communicate effectively, etc. I've learn to release parts, to run effective meetings and communicate effectively with the team. Work culture is loaded with stress and people are expecting an immediate answer to issues that will not have immediate solutions. The hardest part of the job is to keep up with all the emails, and changes will effectively engaging with other teams. The most enjoyable part of the job is to actually see my developed parts inside the vehicle."
good,worked remotely.  traveled 2 days a week.  excellent training.  hands off manager but not any guidance.  Hardest part of job was not being able to quote price.  Most enjoyable part of job was working with different industries.
good,The job is easy but the stress of constant threat of losing my job was ridiculous.  It would be a great job if I was a permanent worker with full benefits.
good,We came in as temps with the understanding that we would eventually become permanent.  You were laid off at a moment's notice.  My last supervisor used to be an engineer and didn't have the necessary skills to run a department.  I being a temp was blamed for problems that arose in the department and this was my first time in that department.
good,"Terrible management, this place doesn't know the meaning of communication. Production line is all about numbers and if you drop dead on the line as long as it wasn't a safety issue they pull you off and start the line back up again.  Absolutely heartless company with no room to grow. It's a union shop so the people who bust their butts cover the ones that don't and there is no problem with that as management sees. Only good thing is the weekly paycheck and some of the people you work alongside with. Most though, hate their lives and are very bitter.  I would not recommend this job to anyone."
good,"Management doesn't care about anyone, hr hires friends and family so they all sit in the office and do nothing and majority of the supervisors don't do anything but go to the office and talk and hang out most enjoyable part of the job is when I got to be team lead"
good,"Nice place to work with decent job security if you are willing to live in the South East Michigan region."
good,I have learn many new and exciting things. From fuel development to autonomous and hybrid. Some people are extremely helpful and will to help you succeed.
good,"The culture in the body shop is very tough to get used too. I normally work for ladder climbers that are only there for a 1-2 year rotation and are only looking to make the budget look good, not spending money, not offering overtime, and running the equipment to failure. When it fails during production then we have management running around in circles with their hands in the air yelling ""the sky is falling."" This is not an exaggeration."
good,"Unorganized "
good,No tempo em que estava prestando serviço foi muito bom adorava trabalhar nessas empresas
good,"Extremely hot in plant, depending on where you work. if you are not full time you get treated like a dog and have to do any job they place you on even if it is difficult for you. I was 7 months pregnant and they had me lifting van doors for 9hrs straight. As a temp you can't call in on the employee absent hotline. The supervisors play favorties which is extremrly corrupt and unfair.  You are expected to put your job above all else which is hard if you have little ones. The pay is great though and you do get some benefits as a part time employee."
good,"Coming in August 6, 2016 and still not being hired after almost 2 years is basis for this review yet still an honest open minded one. I’ll give you true facts not based on my frustration with the process. "
good,"If GM decides to make a sudden change in your job and management, you have nothing to say about it.  You can be thrown into a new group for which you are a poor fit.  Your skills may not be well used and even if you try to explain this to your new Manager, he or she may totally ignore you and force you to do work for which you have never been trained. A supervisor can be named to this position without ever having been a supervisor previously and who has no skills in this position which makes it doubly hard on those beneath him/her.  You can go above your supervisor's head to your Manager, but the Supervisor was named by the Manager, so guess where that complaint goes?  Even if your Director announces in meetings that he will always stand up for you if you need to come to him over your Manager,, that's baloney. Due to cutthroat politics, especially at the Warren Technical Center, they won't do anything to help you. I know Managers at the GM Tech Ctr who tell me they are scared every day they might lose their jobs and they have been at GM for over 20 years."
good,"Fast paced envoronment, but they tried to make it fun. Worked for their “start-up,” and rarely took lunch breaks. Management micromanaged, but the pay was decent."
good,"Pay is not great"
good,"If you’re lucky enough to be hired permanently, you can make this into a life-long career. However, everything is seniority based, so newer hires get bumped around between shifts, jobs & plants. Everything is subject to last minute changes, so it’s difficult to have a stable life outside of work, especially if you have young children. Temporary employees only qualify for most basic of health benefits and are ineligible for any monetary bonuses."
good,Es una empresa de clase mundial pero sus lideres. Son muy difiles de entender uno se ezfuerza por sobresalir pero ellos no lo ven
good,"The work can be very strenuous, "
good,Nice place to work. At my time at cami I've worked in assembly on chassis line working with gas and break lines. I've also worked in weld shop installing the hood doors and hatch. All of which required me to work with others to complete our task
good,"As a temp, you receive no vacation, no sick pay, no profit sharing, no bonuses. When hired, we were told we would be temps for 90 days. 2+ years later and still not made permanent. OK for a second job but you can't rely on them for a future."
good,"I was only working there part time while in school. Once I was in my last semester I was done there."
good,Heavy work load that continues to grow by the day. Managers just throw tasks at you without much notice. You are responsible for 36-40 employees and their performance. Along with the various jobs that get pushed down the ladder.
good,"Most people working there are good people, but the management is by threatening to fire people all the time, for everything. Got much worse since loss of shift,"
good,"decent benefits, work too much, environment is challenging and stressful. decent work, too much benefits, environment is stressful and challenging. too much work."
good,The role I was hired for turned out to be different from what I wanted. I saw no opportunity for advancement. I was essentially put into an entry level position.
good,Was a good job if hired on.  Just not sure when I would get hired on and never did.  Working environment was good. Company never really communicate until last minute with employees.
good,"I learned a lot about the manufacturing process. Unfortunately I was a temp for three years and when the Union had a chance to hire at least 21 of us they turned it down. They pay well and we had health care, but it was stressful not knowing if we would ever be hired."
good,"work is quite hard, pay is decent. not enough hours or consistent work hours. benefits are fair. hired in as a temp and guarenteed 3 days of work a week, been on one day a week for the last 3 months"
good,"in spite of the strides GM has made since bankruptcy, this is not an innovative company.  The structure and processes of the company are as nearly as old as the company (108 years).  This creates a lethargic, don't speak unless you're spoken to culture where management is everywhere and leadership is nowhere. GM really struggles here.  It seems no one is in charge.  Decisions are made at the last second after eons of fruitless debate.  The lowest common denominator is the end result."
good,the General Motors company uses a temp service to hire the workers and the temp services are very unorganized and unprofessional. The learning experience was good however the management and cultural of the company is very poor.
good,Buen ambiente..muchas horas de trabajo..gran distancia
good,Once hired in there was no room for advancement. Worked there a little over a year. Came in a 16 an hour and beside the many awards from the company pay stayed the same.
good,"Muito boa de trabalhar,sai apenas por causa da crise,a gestão é fraca,liderança não sabe como trabalhar com as pessoas."
good,"Manage and train dealers on program that GM has to offer. No day is the same, lots of movement daily. good position, Did not like bounus structure"
good,"Companies target diverse consumer markets, however when it comes to hiring and promoting diversity there is none.  This company lacked a true goals and objectives on how to develop and grow their talent."
good,"Management is a drag. Modern day slavery. Make just enough to make you stay, but not enough to make a living a support a family."
good,"The work at general motors was not hard they have done a lot to make sure the people are working in a safe environment. I did not like being kept as a temp for over a year and 5 months. There are no benefits for temps and if you get injured you are fired. I met a lot of great people, my foremen was great. The pay was great but, it is not a place for people who are raisiing children. If you manage to stay and get on first shift, it will allow you to raise your children, if you are on any other shift you better have a great partner in life or a great family."
good,"Interesting work, but management has no concept of what goes on on the floor. No room for career development or growth. Trying to fight fires on a day to day basis while performing basic job functions."
good,"The days of life long careers at GM are over. They look at each employee as a number not as a true member of the family like many other companies. GM still provides unique experiences and opportunities, just don't plan to work there over your entire career."
good,"Empresa com ótimos benefícios porém, para a juventude, não oferece plano de carreira."
good,"El ambiente laboral hacia los empleados es muy pobre en cuestion de tener oportunidades a gente que se ha desarrollado dentro de la empresa.."
good,"A General Motors do Brasil esta deixando de ser um dos 5 centros de engenharia mundiais onde a empresa passa por uma grande estruturação."
good,"I loved the job, and the first 4 bosses were great.  The 5th boss, not so great. The client was awesome, which was General Motors, and we could have done more for them I think.   I worked with some good people and we exceeded our financial goals, the staff were great!"
good,"I did engine inspections along with assembly line work. I learned a lot about the parts and workings of a car engine. My immediate supervisor was very friendly, and my co-workers were very nice. The job was not a hard job. I enjoyed working there very much."
good,"Focus is on sales and market share growth"
good,"As an assembler, you are required to be certified at many different assembly positions.  At the Lordstown plant, you are required to assemble all of your parts within a 50-60 second window.  Typically, you will help build more than 400 cars per shift.  The work is sometimes tedious.  Ergonomically, you are forced to use just certain parts of your body to assemble the vehicle.  This causes a lot of the senior employees into worker compensation claims or FMLA circumstances.  There was a lot of artificial stress placed on front-line supervisors from management above.  It was not unusual to see foremen fired/removed from their positions, at will, because of conflicts with superiors or an inability to meet criteria or quotas that, more often than not, were not attainable.  This pressure from above was sometimes displaced directly upon the workers who did the assembly work.  Thus, most employees did not have a favorable impression about any of their superiors.  The co-workers were excellent.  Most are referred for employment by other family members.  The plant was large enough that you didn't really have to worry about nepotism.  There was a certain comradery because of the demands of the work.  The hardest part of the job is getting a routine down so that you could accomplish your tasks within the 50-60 second time frame.  During the summer months, you literally would sweat the weight off.  Thus, there is this demand that you have to be somewhat physically fit to do the jobs.  An unfortunate reality is that upper management has put such pressure on production that nearly every job"
good,A typical work day at GM. Enter the tin shop and unlock the tool boxes and start on the jobs from the previous day. I would take walk in maintenance jobs take calls by pager or cell phone for any problems on the floor production lines. the jobs would range from small things to maintenance jobs that required much time with shift follow up. When working construction we would build off blue prints when available and if not just do our own design work. We would do anything from 4 in. to 48 in. pipe work ventilation systems. Quality would be a continuous part of days as we were always working around solving any problem with the Engineers. We were safety specialist and also ergonomics specialists helping to solve potential injuries for the line workers. We never knew exactly what we were going to do in a typical day we were very diversified in our training.A tinsmith does not just bend tin.
good,As a temporary employee was a very demanding job and in many ways unfair. Learned many lessons from it so that's what I will build on in future. 
good,"I joined GM AC Delco Division as a contract employee of"
good,"GM Business is strong and growing, with the growth the IT management has not been stable and with the new management from an IT business the focus is not supporting the business values or goals."
good,"A typical day of work consisted of constant movement, lifting, and accuracy"
good,Assembly line work very fast paced. Had great people and management.
good,"Very long and stressful but it was managble. I learned many skills on how to deal with people and the different attitudes, I even learned how to control my own. Overall, Gm was a great experience and I felt like it was a stepping stone to get me to this point where I am in my life right now."
good,like the job you become a good driver by experience testing cars did it for a lot of years
good,"trabalhar na General motors , foi muito legal, pq nunca tinha tido oportunidade de trabalhar numa empresa automobilistica, e graças a Deus eu tive,la eu aprendi muitas coisas , como trabalhar em time ."
good,HAVE YOU HUGGED AN AUTOWORKER TODAY? This should be a bumper sticker!
good,Managed 5 teams installing various trim parts with an automated dash area.
good,"Aprendir a inspecionar equipamentos ,fazer resgate em altura ,espaço confinados,ultilizaçao de veiculos de emergencia bem como seu funcionamento,meu dia era fazer check list de materiais e veiculos de emergencia, rondas preventivas conduzir vitimas ao p.S, acompanhar seviço de riscos como os de soldas em locais perigosos que podesse ocasionar um principio de incendio,acompanhamento de descarregamento de produtos perigosos e quimicos como, solda caustica, glp,sufato de aluminio,com os meus colegas conviviamos muito bem,sem queixas,bem como a chefia a qual me ajudou bastante me dando a oportunidade de ingressar na area industrial."
good,"É uma empresa boa, mas deixa a desejar com seus colaboradores que veste a camisa com seriedade."
good,"CONS: Relentless working conditions for salaried employees, mandatory OT, ZERO work/life balance."
good,"I have enjoyed working at General Motors as it has taught me how to work under pressure and in a fast paced environment. I’ve also learned how to work with different machines, spec devices, and tools. Working at General Motors has expanded my horizons and allowed me to see what more I am capable of. The job security is less than I was hoping for."
good,GM was a nice place to work but has become very goals and deadline orientated.  I has become a factory work type environment where you are there to complete a task and move on.  I didn't like the open seating arrangement which was supposed to join individuals but instead made it less team oriented and more individualist.
good,"General Motors is a company that has given many people an opportunity to be a part of the middle class. However, the working environment is less than ideal. I am grateful for my time . I remain a hard-working employee but it is time to move on to the next phase of my life."
good,Was a great place to work and my job was in line with what my education was. Problem with GM is that they don't provide substantial pay raises. They also like to reduce their workforce and various times. I was part of a salary workforce reduction of 5000 people is February 2019.
good,Working has become very stressful lately as it seems leadership is reverting back to pre-bankruptcy ways.  While C level is saying the right things the front line leaders seems to not be following suit.  Culture is turning more to silence head nodding than speaking up for what you feel is the right thing to do.
good,"General Motors was a good place to work back in the day.  It offered me tuition assisstance, and sick leave.  It had production goals, quality standards, and training.  Now it seems management doesn't care about the employees, just production.  They need to go back and invest in the workers-the greatest value to the company.  A positive work environment, and some thank yous would go a long way."
good,"Es buena empresa, excelentes sueldos y prestaciones, esta adaptando nueva cultura laboral, debe invertir en capacitar a sus lideres y mostrarles lo que significa LIDERAZGO si es que quiere alcanzar los objetivos de los siguientes años, competencia desleal."
good,"I like my job but not management.  Management is horrible.  Employees are disgruntled, over worked and under paid.  Need more vacations days during the year as much as we work.  Need paid sick time"
good,"Well compensated, but void of a meaningful contribution, in that when you did what you know needed to be done for the better of the company you my face backlash by the policy’s you could be subject to."
good,"You will earn a great salary, but you will pay for it with your work-life balance, stress levels, and grumpy old white colleagues.  Experiences will vary from plant to plant.  You will only advance if someone above you likes you and pulls you up the corporate ladder.  Production schedules drive are values above all else."
good,"Work hard to satisfy deliverables"
good,"GM operates in silos.   It let almost all of its Canadian IT people go, because it was consolidating IT operations in the U.S.   At the same time, engineering is hiring developers.   With a little bit of training, many of the people let go could easily do the development jobs that are within the engineering organization."
good,I would not recommend any body to work for this company. They are closing plants and sending there products to mexico. They use temp help for years instead of hiring them full time.
good,"Life-Work balance is a hit or miss. It all depends on your manager and project you are put on. My first year and a half I had to work 60+ hour weeks due to lack of technical and communication skills, experience, and just overall poor and inconsistent management. After that a reorganization occurred. I was put into another project with a different manager in which I was able to have a much better life-work balance. Management was good during that portion (about a year), but then another reorganization occurred about a year later, and management then was again not great, but the project leaders did have a good sense of what they were doing, so it kind of balanced itself out during my last year there, with the middle one being the best one (I worked there about 3 yrs). It did bother me that the longer I was there, the more I seemed to get invited to useless meetings, and by the end about half of them were completely unnecessary and a waste of time. Also, even though it's salary, they still require you to be in the office for a minimum fixed schedule. So it does not matter how efficient you are or if you get your work done early, you still need to stay there until the required time. Working remotely from home is also not an option there. Also, a lot of the people there spent a lot of time talking and gossiping instead of focusing on work, which I assume occurs due to that fixed schedule. Overall, as a new college hire, it was overall an ok job to get some experience. But actually advancing or staying there in the long run does not seem like a sensical option. I will say my first"
good,normal work day was to take calls can assist the users with any type of computer issues and application issues. As well as monitor server alarms an check with site to make sure their was no issue if so to page out to get the right teams to assist.
good,It was a high pace job so you had to be able to keep up with their daily goals. Also be able to stand for long periods of time. Also be able to leave heavy parts
good,Convergys is a company that lead alot to be desired pay was bad for the area. Scheduling was stiff and unreasonable and job moral satisfaction typically was low
good,Days are somewhat planned out. Learning is always encouraged with classes. Management is closer to the product. Workplace culture has change and I'm no longer there to evaluate it. Hardest part of the job is visiting VAPs and continuing to get normal part of job done. See the fruits of my labor into production.
good,"it's busy working in the plant every day also learned, How to "
good,"Overall, not terrible. By company rule, they were not allowed to ask technical questions, so naturally, we hired anyone who claimed to know CSS or Javascript. As a result, for every 3 people we hired, 1 of them would actually contribute."
good,I loved my job there. It's just right now w are laid off. Hopefully they call us back soon. But due to the fact that people are buying trucks and SUV's the need for small cars are slow
good,"Small General Motors Battery Plant, the work pace is pretty steady not to fast, not to slow. The work environment is overall pretty safe and the plant is Air conditioned. Four 10 hour work days with the weekends off. Jobs aren't hard but managers and higher ups makes everything harder than what they really are. Very strict attendance policy, very strict on breaks, and very strict on tardiness. Very strict point system which they follow by the book and they're very trigger happy with disciplinary actions. If you live somewhere in Wayne, Macomb, or Oakland County I WOULD NOT recommend working here, but if you stay somewhere Downriver or in Southwest Detroit then this job is for you."
good,"Not for everyone but it’s a good paying job , very good health care and 401k , nice to get profit sharing to help with income and we never had to work holidays"
good,"Trying to get on as a full time seniority person is hard however I still try and work as hard as I can to reach this position but with GM cutting back to two shifts from three, I don’t know what the outcome will be."
good,"Much has changed since I have been there, but back in 2013, exciting things were happening."
good,"Worked up to 80 hours a week, seven days a week for months straight. Penalized for sick days when employees were being worked to the point of being sick. Group leader did not know how to communicate he would scream instead of having an effective and calm conversation with employees. this is only the Emotors building. cannot speak for main transmission building."
good,"Most days we work very hard, often against what seems to be right, as Management doesn't share their objectives and reasons for many decisions. Feedback is not always welcome on ways to improve"
good,management expects too much from employees.  To many people are having work place injuries due to the cuts in jobs.  You are worked to hard for long hours.  Overtime is required.  The best thing about GM is that it is UNION!!
good,The job was so stressful and required to work extra hours pretty much daily. Since the programs I was in-charge  of overseas. I had to start working at 6 am and finish at 10 pm. That's not the type life I would like to have!.
good,"It is an old culture company which needs to be refreshed in terms of mindset. It is all about connections on how you get prompted. Compensation is low, yet the benefits are great."
good,Audits were very repetitive and lessons learned seemed to be few.  Management was very focused on making deals and adjustments so that senior leaders wouldn't look bad to their superiors.  Nothing done or found should negatively impact production.
good,"Typical large cooperation too many chiefs"
good,"GM was large enough for me to explore many different roles and positions in Brand, Product, and Research in both Automotive Vehicle Sales & Marketing as well as Finance and Vehicle / Parts Operations.  "
good,"Loved working at GM kept us busy there. Started off at $9.00 through a temp service, got a contract a couple years later and got a better wage. They had a Points system attendance policy which we were held to for 5 years. Pointed out in the middle of contract negotiations which took about a year for the Union to finally get the workers a contract."
good,The job was fast paced and could be stressful. Management is fine as long as you're on time and keep the line going. I was a temporary worker for almost three years and never got hired as a perminate employee. On the plus side the pay is great and health insurance is free.
good,"No job security. 3-4 layoffs per year. Temps aren't eligible for benefits until being hired on. Temps are rarely hired before 3 years of emplyment. Once hired in, a great place to work."
good,GM is a team oriented environment. It's tough work for anyone there. Temp employees contribute as much as the full time staff. Management makes decisions that don't always have the best interest of their employees but it all works out in the long run as employees do what they must to complete the tasks at hand which is getting the best trucks to the public.
good,A typical day at work would include lots of standing and walking.  Learned how to build a car.  Management enforced corporate rules.  Workplace culture was very diversified.  The hardest part of the job was working long hours.  The most enjoyable part of the job was having weekends off.
good,"on a tight schedule, bell ring for start time, breaks,lunch and home time.  IF RELEIFdont show will be force to stay over.  need to get releive before going to the restroom."
good,Fast paced work / jobs are machine operated. Jobs not likely to be in a clean environment. Most areas are noisesey and require ear plugs. Safety glasses required.
good,"Great place to work for income, to many layoffs work long term as a temporary worker no bonus or extra benefits after being there a year  temporary employees have no excused time off"
good,Overall General Motors was a very generous place to work but there were too many internal conflicts with the UAW.I was offered a bonus to separate from the company
good,"Every day is different. Usually start by planning the day depending on what equipment is down and what is good to run. "
good,I honestly thought this job was not too good overall. They demanded too much of your time. I did not like there shifts. They made you take a hour lunch which I really didn't like. The room for advancement was very limited.
good,"The overall position is fine. The work is not as rewarding as initially thought to be. Still a very senior staff on hand that has not quite managed to move into the ""new"" GM mindset. Worked with some very good people, however, it is evident that new thought is still unwelcome in many areas."
good,Job pays well really easy going however you never know when you'll be out of a job do to strikes and cutbacks no new hiring ever and plant is closing soon
good,"Two-tier working conditions leading to co-worker animosity. Quantity is more important than quality. People are secondary to product. It takes more than 3 years for temporary workers to become full-time, then 8 more years to reach full wage."
good,"This company is run from the States with an American point of view."
good,"Management aside, the coworkers were supportive and fun to be with at work and away from work, in my position. Management was too focused on the bottom line."
good,"Having worked up through the ranks for more than a decade in the IT unit, I can say with good authority that the company is still very much an old school culture, dominated with management that has been around for  20-30 years. Employees are treated mostly as resources than real people and career advancement/progression/mentoring is not a company priority, although some managers do take responsibility for their individual team members, but given there is limited support from corporate, they are limited to opportunities they can facilitate."
good,Lots of projects going on simultaneously so the teamwork aspect was vital.  The camaraderie was high in my office and significant interactions across to other locations.  Good communication overall led by the office manager
good,My goal was to provide 100% customer satisfaction to all customers who called in with a GM vehicle issue. Mediated cases for the legal department often times negotiating before going to court.
good,"You feel just as a number, everybody just looks after them self, if you have connections, you have a better chance to work your way up. It is all about politics. "
good,Great place to work.  The only hard thing was when times were slow you were unable to achieve a 40hr work week.  Hard to support a family that way.
good,"No room to move up as a temp employee, however, you get a chance to learn a lot within the company. You get treated as a lesser employee compared to the permanent employees. Looked down upon even though your work is equal to or in most cases better than those who have more time and or experience than a temp."
good,"Nice pay, labor can be strenuous at times but the benefits are great. The most deterring part of the job is the amount of time you will be considered temporary"
good,"Your co-workers help make your day go by faster and better. Everyone is different and it helps when you have folks you can talk to about life. No comment about management and Union, you can make your own guess about that."
good,"Aprendí: "
good,it is a 8hr workday hard work must not have a life they want you too give the all your time. Management is ok but don't really care for there people all they want is the work done and done on time good people work there just trying to make a living the hardest part of the job is the pain that you will have in your hands the most enjoyable part about the job is when the bell rings to go home
good,Demanding job of an automotive engineer in a very high paced environment. As a leader you have to be ready to make quick decisions and take risk daily.
good,long days in downtown Detroit....  Significant IT issues are always a barrier to complete work.  Culture is afraid to make decisions and co-workers are very competitive.
good,Only worked 3 days out of the length of time I was suppose to. checked over 15 break systems on pallets before installation. maneuvered pallets in other area for shipping. Checked in with supervisor.Never called me to tell me if my time there was up.
good,"já mencionado na outra avaliação, empresa com ótimos benefícios e salários mas com uma politica de remuneração que não é clara."
good,"uma excelente empresa, porém mal administrada. Em avaliação geral uma boa empresa para se trabalhar."
good,GM is filled with fantastic people but their management lacks the human element.  Management is confrontational and prefers discipline over encouragement.  I enjoyed every aspect of my employment but I have a very different management strategy.
good,"Hired as a TPT, Temporary Part Time. was either a feast or famine for hours. 48 hours usually or 8 to 24 hours in a week, hard to live like that"
good,"arrive between 5-6 am and leave between 3-4 pm "
good,Was altijd drukke werksfeernzelf weinig tijd om naar toilet te gaan
good,"Buen lugar para iniciar el desrrollo profesional, el aprendizaje es constante y hay varias areas de oportunidad"
good,GM does not provide much opportunity for advancement. The managers also have significant deficiencies with respect to effectively managing.
good,You could be a temporary employee with GM for upwards of 7 years which presents no job security.
good,GM has a strong focus on customer service and meeting deliverables.
good,Working 3rd shift is taking it's toll on my personal life as well as my mental fitness.  I prefer 1st shift.
good,"Very high expectations for very low pay"
good,"Busy doing everyone elses work"
good,"Depending on the group you're in, most of the work is too narrow in scope.  Co-Workers in general are great people, but if you have high aspirations to be challenged intellecually, it's a tough place to get it."
good,"I learned new things every week, i enjoyed working with this company"
good,"I work in a factory, I currently work on a surfance mount production line.I also perform various tasks related to the auto assembly process. I train new existing employees, collaborate with team memebers oversea other jobs and skills.The enjoyable parts of my job is knowing that Im being helpful and useful in my day to day task."
good,"A empresa oferecia grandes oportunidades de se aprender uma profissão, porém poucas oportunidades de promoção. Havia muitos que sabiam fazer quase tudo, porém poucos tinham a chance de serem promovidos. Aprendi lá, a trabalhar em grupo e equipe, aprendi também: ""Ordem, Limpeza e Arrumação"" e que: ""Pra tudo existe um lugar e que tudo deve estar em seu lugar"". "
good,"open door policy where view and suggestion are taken in formulating policy and employee guide line, friendly co-worker"
good,I currently am employed on Contract at General Motors Oshawa. It is a very challeging position.
good,"I worked in one of the traditional GM plants with a union that had its heels dug in. The work conditions were poor, and much of the company culture was dominated by a non-sensical labor agreement."
good,"Há reunião no início do turno, abrangendo assunto de segurança, após cada funcionário vai para sua área de atendimento."
good,"gm was a good temp job, but everyday was a challenge bc i constantly got moved and i was expected to know the job as if i had been on it for years..."
good,"Great people, talented people, Overall ethical company and great values"
good,"Depending on position and management support, it is somewhat difficult to maintain balance between work and personal life. Job advancement is difficult."
good,The work was very interesting sometimes and management was ok. The pay was good but there was some times to much work and it seemed like my work group was short handed most of the time.
good,Empresa tem pessoas formadas em engenharia cuidando de gente.
good,buen trabajo con los técnicos ambiente relajado por parte de la supervisión horario flexible .
good,"My manager was not on site and rarely interfaced with me."
good,Great people in most areas. Management can be great if everyone read the contract the same way. Hours are long. Jobs can be easy but most are overloaded and because they are repetitive your body hurts.
good,"it’s not a bad place to work for benefits, but you don’t have much of a life considering you work 50+ hours every week. also, management harasses you."
good,"Your day to day is never the same, some days are consistent other days are fast pace which makes the day go by fast. Prepare to work with a cast of characters and you never know what you will get."
good,"provide gym at workplace"
good,"Managerial skills should be taught with high priority before anyone is given the position. The lack of communication, sexism and job rotation not being enforced creates a hardship."
good,"Typical Day, work in area and reset faults that occur. Do as instructed by management. Hands of Robot controls rarely, PM work as directed, Rare to work Overtime and Weekends"
good,"The auto industry is ever changing in technology and competition.  Gas prices dictate the vehicle style consumers buy, and most compact cars are out of style.  Unless you are a designer, engineer, or upper management prospect, stay away!"
good,Very cool technology and very long work hours with no work/life balance. Passionate employees with good work ethic. Working for a good manager was hit or miss.
good,Can’t speak much for current environment since I haven’t worked in this field for 16 years. Was very dog eat dog when I was there. I’m sure things have changed but I know top pay has not.
good,"Empresa dinâmica, porem burocrática..."
good,The department started off great but as time went on things just started to go downhill.  One manager tells you one thing and then another tells you to do something else.  No structure.
good,Un aprendizaje significativo para  tu desarrollo profesional en las diferentes areas de ingenieria y sectores afines
good,Management only cares about the number of trucks they can get off the line to get their bonuses. Regardless of the operating conditions of the trucks Or the well being of the employee.
good,"They paid great, and had good benefits. That's about where the plus's end. It was mind numbing and monotonous. There was no thinking while there. Management cared about numbers over quality."
good,"Nice to punch the clock and go home without takng it home with you. But its a high paced, repetitive, boring job. Management treats you like little kids, have to ask for bathroom breaks and are questioned about everything. Overall, it's a decent place to work but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone and I dont want my children working here"
good,Manufacturing is very demanding.  Meeting daily production goals are a must.  Learn to deal with the stress or find another place to work.  There is no such thing as work life balance.
good,"I loved the people I worked with, but sadly management at all levels seems more concerned with perks and politics than actually doing work that benefits GM strategic goals. Constant reorganization’s and each year brings a new direction."
good,I would estimate that 20% of the managers are good leaders. This opinion is from experience of working at GM for 25+ years in both engineering and manufacturing.
good,"The pay and benefits were some of the best you will find in Detroit.  OK Work-Life balance, if you assert yourself.  Management is poor and has a hard time thinking through a strategy and following through.  EVERY decision seems to need to got to a director to be implemented.  Enormous amounts of time are spent prioritizing and estimating initiatives only to decide to cancel them all even if they have proven high business benefit.  Opportunities to advance are few and far between. Most of the technology they are using are a few generations behind other companies.  Basically its a decent job if don't have a lot of career aspirations."
good,"Large complex company rapidly changing and transforming to adapt to market changes and keep healthy profits."
good,"Too many org changes with leadership changes had put lots of changes to operations before realizing the impacts of the planned org and process changes.   In the short term it looks like the leadership is driving change in the org, but there is no accountability for the leaders to access the changes as they move on to newer things.   This is good for aggressive team members as they move on to different things, but this is hurting due to too many changes and in this process lots of good ideas that benefit the company of washed off as the leadership is moving on with no commitment to the changes they have pushed."
good,Empresa que se importa muito com a segurança dos funcionários embora deixe a desejar nos aspectos de motivação e desenvolvimento.
good,"Enjoyed working with the end users, helping to resolve issues and providing the tools they needed to perform their jobs. GM IT has not been able to establish itself, a lot of growing pains which may be costing the end user production time."
good,"- GM provides good compensation to it workers and does provide people with opportunities to move throughout the company."
good,"The maintenance department works more hours than other departments.  That's understandable since most repairs are done on weekends when the machine or line is down  For that reason, most maintenance employees don't have the same quality of life outside since we're working weekends.  It's not uncommon to work 26 or more weekends a year.  Other departments don't have this requirement."
good,I'm not at liberality to share info about the company based on the contract I signed at the end of my employment so I need this to be blank to get this processed.
good,Couple of meetings everyday. Could learn new tools. Flexible work environment. helpful colleagues. Hardest part is to get work moved to production. Several opportunity to enhance career.
good,Overall good company however going back to old ways of doing business.  Could be bad for future of company.  A lot of good process and structure.  Tends to focus too much on the purchasing teams justifying their work instead of trusting what they do.  Great supplier relations.
good,"Working with GM requires dedication, there will be a lot of overtime required. If you have small children it is not the ideal place to work. As schedules and mandated overtime cause a lot of conflicts with work/ life balance."
good,"Company structure is needing restructure. No clear product direction. Manufacturing facilities are world class. Factory culture is good, main engineering and central office environments poor."
good,The concept of of bringing everything back in-house is a great idea and should be embraced.  The lack of internal ownership of application created a dependency on external partners having no interest in delivering quality/cost efficient solutions in a timely manner.
good,"GM has the right idea of in sourcing but still tied to big company thinking. "
good,Innovation center was growing for years - perhaps too fast and now they are doing layoffs. However there are many opportunities for cutting costs that have not been explored before people are losing their jobs.
good,The job pay is the only reason why i stayed and wouldn’t mine going back to work for but at ah way much higher pay.  Some people are alright to work with but must people upset with no time off with family.
good,"Automation Test Engineer, who possesses articulate and professional communication and interpersonal skills while focusing on VBScript development and Manual Testing. Productive in both team based and self-managed settings. Exceptional leadership qualities, a team player, self-motivated and flexible to working in any work environment. Fully committed to corporate goals and proficient at meeting the challenges of both tight and relaxed deadlines. Dedicated to maintaining up-to date industry knowledge and IT skills."
good,a job at GM is only good for about 10 years the gov bailed them out and Gm closed plants in the US but not mexico or other countrys its a good job ...BUT not a future
good,"My duties included:"
good,Workplace culture is only favorable for certain groups.  Management is a hit or miss.  You could have a great manager or one who doesn't know anything.
good,"GM started out strong with great benefits, supportive work environment, and pathways for career growth. Over the last few years they have been gradually taking these things away, and are now announcing big layoffs. This is a corporate culture that took a stab at being an IT company but ultimately decided to go back to what they are used to."
good,"Keep in mind that key is your direct manager. Organizational culture is hard to change. Diversity in leadership is very low. White male culture, even though the working bees are very diversified."
good,"My time at General Motors as a Registered Nurse was fantastic.  I loved my co-workers and even when I was sick, I came to work anyway because I would rather be at work than laying around in the bed all day.  Eventually, I was promoted to supervision, and I liked the job: it consisted of long hours with no pay for staying over (it was expected of you.  I was talked to and scolded for working 8 hours and leaving.  I was told that it looked bad that I wasn't putting in at least 12 hours a day *Yes, with no pay for the additional 6 hours)."
good,"For a company that promotes itself as a ""Workplace of Choice"", they show no sincere consideration for their employees. New executive management in the Customer Care and Aftersales division is more concerned with pontificating and rattling the cage, toppling the apple cart, treating employees as robots, moving seasoned employees into roles they are not knowledgeable of nor interested in."
good,No geral gostei de trabalhar lá. O Grande problema é que os chefes esquecem da parte Humana e acham que você é como um robô.
good,"Promising potential as GM overall is an excellent opportunity. "
good,"never knew what you were doing each day.  They acted like you did every job for years. When you acully just started, and dont know anything of the rutean or scheldule of thing to be done. Just said go there and do it. Only seen managment at the beging of the shift or when soming wasn't done or done correctly."
good,"NOTE: I am not a GM employee. I work for the contract security supplier."
good,"General Motors is a corporation, nothing more or less. If you can work within the environment of a large corporation you will be ok.  Everyone should have the opportunity to work for a large corporation at least once to see how the wheels turn."
good,"General Motors is very ambitious when it comes to building an IT department from essentially scratch.  There are several drawbacks to this attempt however."
good,"The Revenue Management portion of the OnStar Division of General Motors is a place where every day is unique in its challenges. In my time there, I learned how to analyze the activities of members and sales representatives and how to communicate my findings clearly and concisely to management in order to prevent loss of revenue. The hardest part of working with this team was training others to take over the position that I had invested many hours into refining. The most enjoyable portion of the position was the daily challenge associated with new investigation cases."
good,"Montadora de renome, que após 75 anos no país, teve de se reiventar, para manter-se no mercado."
good,"O beneficios são otimos , mas o plano de carreira e ruim."
good,"Workplace culture varies among business units, mainly as a result of different management styles. This can greatly impact the hardest and most enjoyable part of the job."
good,I am glad I had the opportunity to work and learn about automobile production. The Team Leaders and co-workers were good.  The Group Supervisors for both the Moist Sand first shift and the South Seal all three shifts were good to work for.
good,"I learned a great deal in nearly 19 years"
good,Buena capacitacion.  Gran desempeño laboral.Oportunidad de crecimiento..
good,"Not too bad. Work culture can be better and if employees at low level can be heard and if there opinion was valued/considered, it can probably be better instead of making things green and check mark off the list."
good,Real nice place to work if management and was concerned about their employees overworked. And no respect for home life our family. Management are not concerned about home time the workers are overworked I have seen where I employees have passed out got sick and they have they give you such an housel about leaving even if there's a family emergency if you have an accident on the way to work they hold it against you you get written up for any small thing
good,Great benefits but terrible management and job culture. Many of the people dread coming to work due to a few bad apples that keep up drama. Management is ruthless.
good,"I was in an area (Environmental) that no-one in management wanted anything to do with. I was reassigned to several different departments whose heads were not inclined to follow environmental instructions so getting things done always took extra effort.  However, the people who worked for me were very cooperative and most became my friends.  The main problem at this plant was that GM had decided to close the plant and did not assign their best managers to work there. At the end, I was assigned to GM Facilities who had the Environmental responsibility for all of GM and the authority to enforce their procedures."
good,GM does provide a secure work place to work and flexible work hours are a nice benefit. GM has never invested in developing their employees as the only required training courses deal with internal relations and processes.
good,"Your work life balance can be thrown off due to the schedule fluctuations. "
good,"Es un ambiente de trabajo agradable, flexibles con los horarios."
good,Empresa que se dedicaba a la formación de trabajadores de calidad.
good,General Motors is a wonderful company to work for when you become permanent. It is a hard job to be a temporary and have a family life around it. I have been with the company for two years never called off but also never allowed days off. I have grown to not feeling much while at work just get my job done right and go home.
good,I wear multiple hats and have learned in the Planner and Surface Engineer role. Most enjoyable part is meeting customer expectations on a daily basis.
good,"Empresa com um ambiente de trabalho hostil, são poucas as pessoas que tem educação e sabem como tratar uma pessoa, o importante é o carro sair pronto no final da linha, mesmo que para isso tenha que ser ao berros ou no chicote, os funcionários são apenas números, do mesmo jeito que são contratados são dispensados,!!!"
good,"Much too unstable for me, management isn't very great Especially the union side, they are very unhelpful and seem to just be money hungry and in it for themselves."
good,"As a temp you have no real rights, no paid days off, you are required to work friday, saturday and sunday if needed, You do all the work the permanent workers do and get none of the bonuses."
good,"No paid time-off, hours awfully early (6 a.m. start time) although I AM working for sub-contracting company M.S. as my employer. The location is unbeatable; 15 minutes from home!"
good,"As a ""Temp"" or ""Flex"" employee. You are required to do whats needed in terms of demand of the plant or filling in for a job that has someone missing that day because of (FMLA, Sick leave, Vacation, PTO, Requested Saturday) they really expect alot from you as a temp and youre expected to bust your butt to reap half the benefits the Full time permanent ppl get such as dental, profit sharing, vaction, Union rights (as far as securing your job). The culture there definitely seemed to be acceptable for many years but as the sales decrease and the number of full timers who dont show up for work and a lack of passion, good management and sense of quality over quantity it seems the plant is slowing losing what they once had which was a great place to work with great beenfits surrounded by ppl who cared about their product... npt so much now. Its just the numbers game"
good,"Senior management can use a major overhaul.  If you're not part of the Good Ole Boy crew, don't expect much advancement.  Pay decent for the workload and the benefits are very good."
good,I was a temp for over a year at General Motors.  We didn't get the benefits.  We couldn't bid on jobs.  Stuck on job they gave you.  No profit sharing
good,I was involved with the IT Standards team which was a new GM initiative created by the TIO at that time who was also new to the companyand charged with the task of setting up this process and team.  It was a nice idea in theory but in [practice it turned into a bit of an unwanted stepchild.
good,"I work as a Buyer. My typical day is high stressed from the moment I arrive, until I leave. I often work evenings and weekends at home. I am stressed from the time I arrive until I leave. Poor working environment, recently lost my cubicle and forced to work in a 'hotel' desk."
good,Its an old company and its shows. GM is slow to change and it is car company it view its tech center as a cost not a money maker or a money saver. Not a good tech company.
good,"Not consistent with shift or job, can be bumped from shift to shift, if not permanent your job is not guaranteed."
good,"Not much room for advancement. Usually the selection is made prior to the interview, in some cases the best qualified would not be selected. No guidance on how to advance either"
good,Wentzville plant very hard union and lack of leadership to deal with the union that  wants to use GMS as an escape goat to stop line and compain about continuous improvemrnt and built in Quality.Need to be on same page to keep good paying jobs in Wentzville.
good,"Trabajo muy monótono y estructurado, ambiente casi militar con transporte incluido"
good,"Only good for obtaining a paycheck, job not useful to workers in any other aspect. If you're trying to make a career you're not in the right place. You'll waste away years."
good,this site has a high turn over rate. when the HQ hears your coming hear they laugh thats not a good sigh. Dont get me wrong there are some good people here. but it all depends on the person and what shift you have
good,"The people you work with are a good bunch of guys"
good,"Production output was low, equipment problems, imbalance in the production lines due to scheduling and other unforeseen problems. Too much lost time,in-house problems."
good,"As a Administrative Assistant i did such things as typing reports and correspondence, filing, answering phones, taking dictation and directing visitors to the proper location on a daily basis."
good,"Very heavy bureaucracy, as can be expected from an old-school mfg company. Worked in the IT Center, but little tech-company feel. No freebies in the office, except water and ice. No snacks, no free coffee, no free drinks, no paper plates or silverware etc for use during lunch. Nothing. So that sort of typical ""tech company perk"" is completely absent at GM. Windows-centric technology. "
good,"Long hours, demanding but it can be rewarding. If you work for the right leadership. There is NOT a lot of job recognition, quite lacking from other companies I've worked in the past."
good,"this position was great as I was quite young and taught me how to interact with co workers and other staff and become a useful cog in the wheel of manufacturing,"
good,You can work tons of overtime if wanted. The work is never rewarded and you are rarely told you are doing a good job. You make great money.
good,es una de las mejores empresas a nivel internacional solo que los salarios están recortados por los sindicatos que son los que hacen un mal a los trabajadores por que cada año le añaden unos cuantos pesos a las prestaciones generales y que no ayudan en el crecimiento profesional de los que ya estamos al tope en salario orillando a que exista mucha rotación de todas las áreas por no motivar económicamente a los trabajadores.
good,"Boa empresa em relação a salario, porem as promoções são muito dificil, a não ser que seja parente de alguém importante dentro da empresa ou muito próximo tambem de alguem importante dentro da empresa."
good,"Deixou a desejar por falta plano de carreira."
good,"grande structure d'entreprise"
good,"Ambiente limpo, descontraido ."
good,"You will work from 40 to 48 hours (5 to 6, 8-hour days) per week depending on the demand and what shift you are on.  The management turnover rate seemed pretty high, but they responded well to issues in my experience.  Your experience will depend highly on the location of your job and the people around you.  For the most part co-workers are nice and helpful, but there are plenty of rotten apples at a place like that as well."
good,Eu trabalho na preparação de pintura mas lá aprendi set-up de ferramentas fazer reparos com solda retrabalho de peças operar painéis de prensas analisar peças sempre priorizando o foco no cliente .Me dou bem com todos os meus colegas e superiores mas busco um maior crescimento profissional.Não vejo nem uma parte difícil no trabalho e a parte mais agradável é ver o nosso serviço depois de pronto feito com responsabilidade e qualidade.
good,"Management can be overbearing and non understanding, union reps are very unhelpful and advancement will not happen. No overtime and the people that work there are mainly drunks and drug users"
good,"Worked on assembly line, jobs flexuated, as well as shifts. Management was all over the place. Rough work environment, fast paced easy jobs though, alot of repetition."
good,"GM has its own city..the people are quite different. Most are kind and intelligent but there are some who, you have to wonder how they got the job. Unfortunately the union will work on those peoples behalf.( the lazy ones) Other then that the money and benefits are good if you get on as a permanent employee."
good,"The learning curve is excellent while management is not in touch with employee.  There is not a great support group and training required to advance skills, and knowledge."
good,"GM is a great place to work, however in Venezuela they do not have the required support from goverment to acchieve their goals."
good,As a member of the maintenance/process team you will work a LOT of overtime. Work life balance is terrible. Pay and benefits are excellent but probably not worth the misery.
good,"I enjoy being working under dead lines and pressure. Once the job is done, especially when i tally my accounts after the long hectic day, it gives me immense satisfaction. Am a workaholic."
good,"You can work as hard as you want or as little as possible. Workload is not balanced evenly throughout the comapany."
good,"Excelente local de trabalho, fábrica climatizada, ótimas pessoas também fazem parte do time. O salário da empresa fica aquém da grandiosidade da compania e também do mercado."
good,The company is shifting from a global collaboration culture back to an in-house limited environment which is creating extreme stress for work life balance.
good,"Morale in plant was terrible."
good,"If you are friends, play golf or party with the boss you will go places even if you are a complete idiot."
good,"The job was fun and a different experience, I was a full tine temporary employee did not know when the job would end. When the job ended I was only given 2 day notice"
good,"Empresa boa de trabalhar, mas com muita pressão por produção"
good,"Empresa com um bom horário de serviço, com incentivos profissionais, o serviço muito repetitivo buscando sempre qualidade e menor tempo de execução."
good,"Foi uma boa experiencia trabalhar na GM-Algar."
good,"The typical day revolves around the clock managing operations that have a high impact on the company’s bottom line.  I learned a lot in the 14 years on what it takes to be an effective leader and the importance of process compliance. The most challenging part of the job was the interaction with a very demanding senior union leadership.  The most enjoyable part was working with my management team, watching them grow in their jobs, and learning how to be successful in their positions."
good,"There is always room to grow at GM."
good,"It provides IT services and is one of the world's largest consulting, outsourcing and professional services companies with 125,110 employees in 48 countries"
good,Great people there but management doesn't care for it's workers
good,treinamento no senai de solda gratuito
good,During my 30 plus years at GM I was very fortunate to be able to make a decent living and provide for my family. I met some wonderful people that I can truly call friends. I was able to do many different jobs while there which I liked because I prefer variety. The toughest part for me was watching a management team that seemed to be determined to do there best to watch our lively hoods get washed away. I would really like to work for a company that was willing to listen to there employees suggestions. Overall I had a great experience working there.
good,"Uma empresa que valoriza a sua politica, desde a segurança dos funcionarios até a qualidade do seu produto final."
good,Perfect opportunity to learn while being compensated. Paid education in a hands on environment.
good,"LOVED the job always been a fan of factory work, and this job was definatly a challange for me."
good,Great company and they make sure to take care of employees during the holidays. just needs a better pay structure and raise structure as well as more professional managers.
good,"empresa sempre , pagou o salário nos dias marcados, em 15 anos de trabalhos, sempre recebi no dia correto."
good,"I enjoyed my job in the quality department, constantly a situation to learn. Not so much on the production floor. Temporary workers are treated poorly, although given health insurance, good luck getting time off to see a doctor with out risk of being let go. If you can with stand the lay offs and rehires long enough, you might take a chance."
good,"É uma boa empresa para se trabalhar, me desenvolvi e aprendi muito,"
good,"None stop repetitive assembly. Buzzer to buzzer, with 10 minute rest period after 2 hours production and a 25 minute rest break after 4hours, with another 10 minute rest period after 6 hours of production."
good,"Overall satisfactory,  however wasn't enough understanding between management and hourly employees. Needed more communication lack of understanding between the two. Lack of understanding of what jobs actually involve. Need more hands on from salary personnel."
good,"Constantly challenged by meeting or beating my objectives. "
good,"No inicio das minhas atividades na GMB, iniciei na área de Estamparia e trabalhei ali por volta de 7 meses, na linha das prensas de grande porte na construção e estampo de peças para construção de carroçarias para montagem dos veículos; Depois fui transferido para área de Manuseio de Materiais, onde fazia varias funções dentre elas: Operação de Empilhadeiras alocando, carregando e descarregando caminhões e carretas nas docas e estoques de materiais e peças ; Sequenciado de peças para abastecimento de linha de montagem entre outras funções."
good,"hard long hours, very little time off, temp employees rarely get hired. after 20 yrs vacation time is competitive, health insurance is good after 4 yr. Management is not fair or friendly."
good,"It was a pleasure working at General Motors, working as a team and make friends of different cultures.Some teamleaders weren't very helpful and were only there for the money. If General Motors decided to come back to South Africa I wouldn't hesitate to work there again"
good,If you are PATIENT and not afraid of HARD WORK.... Please apply... You will come in as a temp for up to 4 years. Hopefully the new contract will change for the better and you wont have to wait so long without benefits. Good Luck
good,"GMC has a very high pay grade but that is for permanent employees only. even if there are positions avail, you are looking at 3+ years before you will be brought from temp to perm due to management arguing."
good,"It's a job. Nothing to jump up and down about. Some managers are better than others. The pay is decent, but the job security is not. Many layoffs, hard to stay excited in this field. Easiest way to get into this company is to follow directions."
good,A typical day at work was the same as every other day.  The possibility of downtime throughout the day.  Physically demanding.  Mentally relaxed  Management was sub-par.
good,In the beginning I enjoyed going to work. Later on not only was it repetitive but your life was tied to the job.  You really had no time for family or time for yourself especially if you worked 2nd shift.
good,"Trabajo bajo presión y alta exigencia lo que hace dificil conseguir un buen balance vida/trabajo, poca estabilidad laboral debido a las continuas restructuraciones. Sin embargo el sueldo y las prestaciones son buenas"
good,"Not the worst job I've had. "
good,"As a temporary employee you are required to understand the jobs as quickly as possible without prior knowledge of the jobs to remain valuable is a problem. If people aren't giving the time and effort into the training into the new people it causes nothing but issues. A typical day for a temp is to wait to be assigned for a job you have or have not learned, and learning from team leaders or other employees on that job. Unfortunately the mind set of ""keeping to myself"" is very strong with General motor employees, so half the time you get halved trained and caused problems down the line which causes people to point fingers and blame the new person and breakdown their moral. everyone is different, everyone learns things differently than others. The hardest part is quite frankly is the people who have ""authority"" or ""seniority"" complaining or not training properly. What i enjoy most of GM is understanding that you are here to do a job and go home. Advancement is based on seniority so you have to put your time in. Its a matter of preference if you think it is a good thing or a bad thing. Now for family. This job will have you work Saturdays not all of them but majority, so if you have young children i would honestly not recommend this. Benefits are decent enough to stay. I wished things are different to encourage temps mostly to get hired on quicker. I've heard that some temps do not get hired on for 3+ years unfortunately and that alone causes peoples moral to break and give up on this job. If they want to continue to hire new people they need to look into hiring temporary employees"
good,"The benefits and salary were top notch, but the culture and room for advancement was non-existent. There was a lot of lip service about wanting to change the culture, but nothing ever really changed. Then the massive layoffs came, which did nothing to reinforce the idea that they were looking out for their future or their people. There is the rhetoric, and then what actually happens.  I'd recommend it for someone who wants to settle into a very regular routine, but do not expect management empathy, or advancement."
good,When I began my career in management in 2000 GM was an exciting place to work.  We were encouraged to be creative and to stretch the limits of our creativity.  Over time the company evolved to be focused on concepts as opposed to building cars.  Not a fun place to work.
good,"The benefits are awesome, they do tuition reimbursement if you've been with the company for over 1 year with a 5 year commitment after you've graduated."
good,"I had a great time working there all around until job cut and it became everyone for themselves. Secrets everywhere about what direction the company is going, then bam lay-off papers. Call u back in 6 months only to lay-off again. If u want a job be prepared for ups and down and to move."
good,"As a team leader I enjoyed the job. Bay City Powertrain is a much better place to work than other  GM plant since you are not on an assembly line. One major issue for me and many others, is that you are just a body to them. Very poor management in the higher ups."
good,"Disclaimer: This review is solely for the operations side of the company. The opinions here do not reflect innovation, business, or any other aspect of the company."
good,"Es una muy buena empresa, desafortunadamente no hay mucha posibilidad de crecimiento"
good,"The company is decent for a college new-hire. After that, there are not many growth opportunities as you are constantly faced by glass-ceilings. Start here, get to know the industry, then leave."
good,"Typical day at work:"
good,"plant ""unallocated"" indefinitely laid off, do not want to relocate across the country, would be nice if GM would allocate a new product for the plant instead of building outside the U.S."
good,"I had a great experience working the General Motors, Working with highly skilled people and learnt a lot during the process. They usually take good care of their employee."
good,This was a good place to start my career as a recent college grad. There are several opportunities  and resources if you are willing to apply yourself
good,Fired 4500 employees without a reason. Be-Aware of this company. It feels like the employees are not important for the company. No reasons were given when the employees were laid off.
good,"Recently mandated reductions in force impacted employee morale and caused the loss of some good people and knowledge base. Prior to changes, lots of flexibility in ability to execute job function in the Field."
good,"As a large company, GM has a lot going for it and against it. While it can be a reliable place to work for, it can also be lumbering monster when trying to move from one business direction to another."
good,"Es una buena empresa por sus prestaciones que ofrece, sin embargo terminas trabajando todos los días, incluyendo festivos y a veces se te pagan los días y a veces te los cambian por alguna otro día normal, perdiendo tu dinero de un día festivo o un domingo laboral"
good,You are a number as a temp and you will never know when it is your last day of work. Hours will vary from one week to the next and they can mandate you to stay over with very little notice. You need to plan on working 6 days in a row for a very long time.
good,Every day was something new to learn and explore.  I enjoyed working with groups of people and tracking issues through a communication board to other people involved in different projects.  Temp contract ran out so we had to go.  Too bad Union and corporate couldn't work things out.  That was not in my hands though.  I just did what I could.
good,"General labor work is hard work it takes a toll on the mind and body physically, emotionally and psychologically If you are a person who can think outside the box this job is not for you repetitive work Is tedious and boring I hated it I'm a thinker I have to do more than one thing to keep me occupied"
good,Empresa estável com salário atrativo e bons benefícios.
good,"There is little workplace culture and the environment is fairly competitive if you want upward mobility. To get ahead it is more about managing up and developing the 'right' relationships. There is mentorship, but you need to seek it out and literally take control of your own career path. Automotive is still tougher industry for women to succeed. Work/life balance is difficult to achieve in many functions given the competition. They offer decent vacation time, but in all my years at GM I saw few who used the time they earned, especially anyone in a leadership role. I worked with several functions (Design, Marketing, Engineering, Planning, Research, etc.), and for several brands and each one has its own dynamics, politics and culture. Like most big companies, you have lots of toxic leaders, bullies and yes men... but there are also pockets big thinkers who work as team players and not just for their own glory. Raises are usually small unless attached to a true promotion, but you can get decent bonus in Feb if company shows profits.  "
good,They hire temporary workers with no time frame to hire. Some have been temps for years.Management expects perfection. Not  allowed to make mistakes. Do not recommend working there.
good,"You need a thick skin - No snowflakes- you are going to get yelled at, you are going to make mistakes. You were hired to do a job so quit whining and do it. Period."
good,I personally do not recommend anyone that cares about self morals or respect to themselves to work at General Motors. The typical workday there is only eight hours. the Lead people that are supposed to help are lazy.. Management is your only hope.
good,The place is falling apart and needs upgraded asap. Needs to be fixed and upgraded so that a new product can come in and run. The CEO has made it clear she doesn't care for her employees at this facility and the jobs of that are being lost. She needs to visit this plant and give a face to face on why she's making top dollar while people are losing their jobs.
good,Management not good and work spread across between  different locations it really hard to communicate and collaborate.work life balance but no career growth.
good,"You are responsible for a certain route daily and you have to clean/disinfect bathrooms and offices, also sweep and mop those areas. You also have other little task through out the day.  Good place to work if you can manage the hours as a single parent they don't give much personal time so if your children get sick or need your attention my personal opinion is they make you feel like you have to choose your parenting or job that's the only negative."
good,Most members if management are pleasant and encouraging.  The ones that aren't unfortunately ruin the whole feel of working for such a large cooperation.
good,The work was okay but most supervision had terrible attitudes and can be bullies and quite verbally abusive. The pay was great but it could not compensate for the lack of home life. They treat you like a robot and do not appreciate it when you use your brain. Best paying job I had and I enjoyed the work but hated the atmosphere. I ended leaving due to the amount of stress.
good,"I worked for Concentrix at General Motors call Center.  When I started in 2014, under Aeroteck, there were @400 agents working in the Call Center.  Big empathizes on employees and recognition, when I left 4 years later, The company had deleted a few of the Specialty Teams, we were down to @60 employees, and the Team Leaders positions, formerly held by General Motor employees had been replaced by Concentrix employees.  Opportunity to join General Motors, had decreased immensely at the Call Center location."
good,"Very low pay when compare to the same job somewhere else. We're very busy sometimes.  My team leader's very helpful.  A leader had no knowledge most of the time.  "
good,"8-10 long hours"
good,This job is temporary with no hire date in sight. The health benefits are excellent for only working one day a week. Don't quit your regular job for this.
good,Very difficult to become a direct hire employee if your contract and political skims do exist at General Motors by favoring peopling within certain groups.
good,"Working in the Call centre as a customer care manager for General Motors was a challenge that I was willing to take. Having a temporary position at a 9-5 intense environment was, for me, a learning curve and a valuable experience but not sustainable due to my current career goals within the entertainment and music industry."
good,Its hard to move from the floor position to management. it's not based on merit its based on relationship. The union is not great here overall management is decent
good,"Open to new ideas but no follow through. Great vacation/discretionary, Cigna insurance, 401k match to 4%. Big changes from a small company come with huge growing pains."
good,though the pay is good and the ability to work from home often is great. the management is toxic and doesn't value the people that actually work. they favor the people who brown nose.
good,"empresa boa de trabalhar, hoarios flexivéis, beneficios ótimos."
good,"Young and new recruits are the main drivers of innovation."
good,"Cultura muito forte mas tem muitos silos e äpadrinhamentos"""
good,A typical day at work would be an exhausting physically demanding job averaging 10 hours of work at  afast paced on an assembly line building and producing products while maintaining a clean and safe work environment.
good,I have worked here for a few years and they cannot innovate. We are stuck with old technologies and bad management. I was able to take breaks daily but I got so bored all the time because they have too many employees working there.
good,"Working for GM is always thought to be great, and I'm sure it could be. My current situation and many like me have left us to find other jobs because of lies spread to us when brought in."
good,"its hard work, people get hurt easily and the jobs are overworked... I already did a review for this employer for indeed and have no real desire to repeat it .. thank you for your time."
good,I was a pool person so I was on a different job every night. Had to learn fast and keep up with the line. It was fun and interesting building cars. Lots of people to work with.
good,"NA, no comments. I have nooto share positive or negative per my employment agreement, please show your respect for this and do not continue to ask me questions I am under agreement not to answer."
good,"I cannot speak for every area as GM is a massive company and every team, department, vertical, and office has a different culture. Your experience can be very different depending on your manager. On the whole, GM is a great place to start a career in IT. There's a lot more job security than a start up and plenty of opportunities to explore and learn new skills. Benefits, especially the 401k, cannot be beat. Career growth slows way down after 2 years or so and the pay (at least in the Austin office) is not very competitive."
good,"The majority of the people that I work with are good, hard working people and feel blessed to have a job with all of the industry ups and downs.   The work is very difficult, physically demanding.  As with any place there are good managers and those who make it a difficult place to work. Not a great deal of positive support from management (at my plant) although at times is seems that some are working to improve operator/management relations.  We hope for the best"
good,It was a good job to keep me through school. It was a contracted company for General Motors. It was very short staffed which made things more difficult and the pay wasn't worth the stress after a while.
good,"A empresa é boa, não atrasa pagamento, mas a vida pessoal é colocada de lado devido aos horários. Por fim o ambiente interno estava altamente estressante pois a empresa estava fechando várias vagas de emprego e com muitas demissões."
good,"Good if you like this type of work. Have to be ready for constant change, especially where you are going to be sitting, cause you will be moving about every 3-4 months."
good,"General Motors IT is struggling in certain areas with innovation in the software development life cycle.  IT was re-structured about four years ago to bring everything in-house at the corporate level. While the company theoretically claims they want to innovate and become a strong IT company, that does not occur at the basic level in some groups. "
good,"General motors is a company where there is too much pressure, I learnt a lot on how to deal with different people, how to present to top management, and also how to be professional."
good,"Finding good bosses can be very hit or miss.  Pay is good, but politics is very, very thick.  The company gets too sidetracked on the latest 'projects du jour' that create a lot of busy work and distract people from adding value."
good,"The company has great pay and benefits. It is very big and fast paced place to work. The hiring system is terrible, with a temporary status averaging 3 to 5 years before full employment. During the temp status you get partial medical which covers emergency visits and some medications. You get no paid time off, profit sharing or FLMA. You will also be required the majority of time to work 6 days a week."
good,"Trabalho em grupo, dinamismo e agilidade, colaboradores interagindo e focados nos objetivos."
good,Decent Place of work and Business. Can manage the family and work balance pretty decent. Overtime offered often. Very strict on temp to hire process. Could be temporary for a long time period
good,"Management attempts to develop your skills for promotions but when the time comes around, some one less qualified receives the opportunity.  Focuses more own advancement rather than subordinates."
good,The job required lot's of walking takes you about 5 minutes to get to the department I was in. GM was okay. I did my work and I came home back to my family nothing too exciting goes on a any work your expected to work.
good,Union job with good benefits.The facility is clean and machine repair on for all 3 shifts. Union representation for all 3 shifts as well. Schedules are every other weekend working.
good,"Aprendi que esforço é tudo, adaptação a diferentes times de trabalho, diferentes liderança."
good,Lamentablemente por la contracción del sector es una empresa que no puede prestar los mejores beneficios del mercado
good,"It is best to work for GM than its subcontractor, CLI who does not accommodate or consider their subordinates.  Plan ahead and be prepared to work independently as there is little supervisory support from your actual employer."
good,Enjoy the fast paced work environment dislike the unknown stability of the plant. Along with unknown uncompensated hours. Looking for something more steady and stable
good,"Very heavy bureaucracy, as can be expected from an old-school mfg company. Worked in the IT Center, but little tech-company feel. No freebies in the office, except water and ice. No snacks, no free coffee, no free drinks, no paper plates or silverware etc for use during lunch. Nothing. So that sort of typical ""tech company perk"" is completely absent at GM. Windows-centric technology. "
good,"Mission extrêmement polyvalente qui touche à la fois à : "
good,the position has a heavy travel schedule. the work experience was challenging. turnover was high mainly due to the travel.
good,"they hire older workers just to blame stuff on them that not true to show government that old people are not able to work. the fact is that they cant get years out of you and heath. "
good,"General Motors is a great company to work for I really enjoy building the cars we build here. The people you work with become close as family, Pay and Benefits are great if you're a permanent employee plus the profit sharing every year and singing bonuses every four years it's great at GM , Now on the other hand it's not so good as a temporary employee you don't get the benefits, vacation time or the same pay as your permanent coworkers that you do the same job as and contribute just as much if not more sometimes but what you do get is worked like slaves to get the numbers that management wants to hit, and when it's time for profit sharing even though throughout the year you and your permanent coworkers put in the same amount of work they get a profit sharing check and you don't and your hard work feels as if it's for nothing and last but not least the union, the union is ok but not so good at least here at DHam for temporary employees that is they take union dues out your check walk around and shake hands all day but don't help you if you're in a situation where you need a union rep to stand up for you like they should, that's really all I can think of right now overall good company if hired in not so much as a temporary employee just being honest a lot needs to be improved but it's not the worst and it's not everyone but the bad outweigh the good here"
good,"GM has in the last 3 years brought all of IT In House, migrating decades of dispirit third party systems and technologies under a single roof."
good,"A typical work day would be that if you did not have a permanent job, you would have to go to the supervisor and see where you were needed.  You could work multiple jobs during a day depending on the need. The co-workers were good to work with and willing to help others.  Management would answer questions when they arose or would get the answer if they did not know it.  It could get a little hectic when working on the line, but the time went by fast."
good,manditory over time. do not work here unless you don't mind missing family.a typical day is not too bad. manual labor. it is a very laid back enviroment depending on where you are located in the shop. large enviroment.
good,"You belong to gm, but great beifits.  Offers alot of overtime.  But you work hard.. sometimes it dient matter hiw you work.  Management wants numbers..its allbanoutbthe numbers"
good,"Fast-pace, safety as the overall priority, and customer satisfaction. Middle and senior management could focus more on employee strengths. Be more positive and constructive, encourage innovation, lead by example, better communication, show empathy, develop and train staff more effectively."
good,"Also provided Kaizens and Suggestions to improve the Quality."
good,"Trabalhei como pintor automotivo, apesar de manusear produtos químicos não recebia insalubridade. A empresa presa pela segurança."
good,"Being a Security Supervisor I am in charge of a team of officers , I am in charge of making sure they are doing their jobs properly and professionally and according to the client's standards. I review performance , and paperwork, perform audits, inspect fire and safety equipment among several other things . The job itself can seem overwhelming at times but all and all isn't to bad once you get use to it."
good,Dont rlly have much to say about this place. Very friendly people and  supervisors were pretty cool and everyone was laid back.
good,"In my point of view, the company is passing through a tough situation. And the mood inside the campany is not good."
good,"Working on the assembly line installing instrument panels was repetitive and not enjoyable. My intention when I went to GM was to get hired into skill trades but in-spite of qualifications and passing required examinations, I never got that opportunity."
good,There was very little opportunity for advancement at the GM plant where I was located. There was a lack of urgency for continuous improvement at nearly all levels of the plant.
good,"Empresa com bastante chance de aprendizado, ótima política e organização, mas longe de ser a empresa perfeita precisa melhorar muito a administração pra ter equilibrio entre ser humano e funcionário."
good,"I enjoyed my role working for this company preparing paperwork, uploading documents and inputting information on to the hub answering the phone to customers, spreadsheets, photo copying etc"
good,"Working on the assembly line at General Motors could be very monotonous and not very difficult. However, by volunteering in health and safety groups I was able to change up the monotonous of my job as well as keep up to date on work place hazards in my industry. While being a member of the health and safety group I was able to strengthen my relationships with different levels of management as well as my fellow co-workers. "
good,"-oranisation of daily activiteis"
good,"I enjoy my day @ General Motors.  Every shift brings new challenges and opportunities for growth."
good,"Work was easy, training was easy.people are very nice, i love work for GM. Always busy and people love to help you out when you dont understand something."
good,the assembly line is just what it seems to be - I assembled parts as they came down a conveyor and ensured that the parts were within coding specifications. My co-workers were amazing and always willing to help. The job became very strenuous on my body.
good,"short lunches and long days, but fun environment depending upon location in the facility. Management was unorganized, also team leads were overworked.."
good,General Motors me permitio crecimiento profesional y personal.
good,Don't really have much to say. The supervisors and HR were hard to find in that place. Working 8 hour days that turned into 12 didn't always put team moral in the best places.
good,not a bad job in today's economy but way better for peolple who has worked there 8+years but i would say if you work hard and push to be more than a production worker you can do it
good,"A great company to work but so many things have changed and our future is uncertain.  Once a employing a powerful union, we now have lost that say so."
good,"great  perks like borrowing a car, cons are bad management, too much politics, no room for growth with batches of college students being hured"
good,"Getting a check every week was great,but the pay did not truly reflect"
good,Jest to miejsce Stałego zatrudnienia gdzie pracownicy sa ciagle nastawieni na słupki i wykresy co robimy zle.Ciągła nagana ze strony pracodawcow nie motywuje pracownikow do pracy.
good,"There are many intangibles to get adjusted to at this facility, so it is a great learning experience overall."
good,"Un dia tipico de trabajo estaba contestar al telefono, a fax y correos electronicos (mas o menos 100 al dia para 4 personas, mas 1 jefe)."
good,"Too many years to tell a typical day. I included that as much as I could in job descriptions. I held many positions. "
good,"É um dia típico onde temos metas na produção , qualidade e segurança para alcançarmos todos  os dias mas aprendemos bastante funções no dia a dia , tenho um bom relacionamento com a liderança e com meus colegas de time , a parte mais difícil é quando falta um colega de time ai ficamos sobre carregados e o mais agradável é o relacionamento com as pessoas."
good,"clocked in"
good,A typical work day would be for me to monitor the process environment.  Perform continuous improvement to the process in forms of filmbuilds and robot cycle times.  I have learned the there is a series of checks and balances while working on the job and it requires a lot of discipline.  The hardest part of the job is multitasking and working with time constraints.  The most enjoyable part of the job would be watching the improvements as you are working to produce a better painted product.
good,"Una empresa que capacita permanentemente, con colegas de buena performance, con un complejo relaciona miento, y que transmite conocimientos permanentes."
good,"Empresa que proporciona a formação de profissionais dentro dos departamentos através de job rotation e desenvolvimento de projetos."
good,"Large facility requiring many skill sets.  Learned supervision, union skiills, and tradesmen duties."
good,Won't find a better job and a more comfortable place to work.  Management and Union are very disappointing as far as creating a committed culture and holding people accountable.  It seems decisions are made impulsively with little communication between effected parties.
good,GM Onstar was a great place to work. They have all cutting edge technology ...
good,"I thought this job was going to be IT related, come to find out that is more like customer relations and services. No challenges, the only way to advance yourself in this position is to become a supervisor. My advise always investigate the position you apply for from a person in the company."
good,"Aprendi muito com a GM, a direção e gerencia respeita os demais funcionários, meus colegas de trabalho me ajudaram muito no meu aprendizado, o mais difícil era a caminhada diária que eu tinha que fazer para levar documentos de um local para outro, a parte mais agradável era os tempos que tínhamos de descontração."
good,"Ssobre os colega de trabalhos , ambiente bom , companherismo , um ajuda o outro."
good,I enjoyed my time at General Motors the management and UAW were great to work with. The use of cutting edge equipment and industry standards was impressive. The company standards to quality and safety gave me great confidence to the future and a great career.
good,"GM is facing some very tough financial times, but is making efforts to make a big turn-around. It will take some time, and possibly shuffling around upper management, but it has an amazing work force capable of leading the automotive industry in the next several years."
good,A. Perpetual motion due to delayed program timing and in catchup mode.
good,"great co-workers, but the line supervisors didn't care about anything but their production."
good,"muy buen aprendisaje en mi labor de ensamblador, experiencia en la soldadura de las cabinas, compañeros emprendedores,"
good,"Overall the company wasn't a bad place to work. The people were friendly and outgoing, management was good, as long as you done your job and what you were suppose to do."
good,"Resilient, hardworking, customer oriented."
good,"-Excellent benefits and opportunities to grow in your career."
good,It is a job that I liked for the first 2 years and then my body started to feel the stress of it. It is a a tedious job doing the same thing over and over. Hard on your body but helps with working with a team. And has very good benefits
good,"Was a great place to work the people we good and easy to work with local management was driven to balance production with safety and did well."
good,"Not much to say but it's a contract type job and it has limitations. Beyond that it would be best to seek another means of a job/career in someone's best interest"
good,"Prós: Empresa top para trabalhar, bons benefícios e remuneração acima da média contando com a participação dos lucros."
good,It's closed and I have to find another career so it wasn't the best place nor the worst place but it could of been a good career now I need to find another career that can feed my family
good,"As usual with manufacturing companies it's good place for work and life balance environment, but with innovation projects its moving towards growing faster."
good,"I was hired by the company, attended orientation but never worked. "
good,"Assist with facilities equipment maintenance & troubleshooting. Design, plan, & manage projects for electrical system upgrades.Have gained a healthy amount of knowledge in controls & power systems. The staff and team members are generally cooperative and open to new innovate ideas to further improve production output."
good,"Excelente empresa, mas com péssimos benefícios, ambiente entre os funcionários excelente."
good,"Not to bad of an job,the pay was decent. Management is not to bad. Coworkers are usually pretty friendly.  Some jobs are fast paced while other are slower.  Paid holidays were nice"
good,"Great learning opportunity under lots of experienced peers. Projects are diversified and interesting. Environment is friendly and supporting."
good,Pretty fast paced on a daily basis.  Overall there are many great people that work there and are dedicated to results and very supportive when in a pinch especially in Engineering.
good,I definitely learned a lot being an employee at General Motors. I learned more about vehicles and how they operate. Working at General Motors helped me to improve my customer service skills and how to work towards what you want in life.
good,"Adquirir experiencia laboral y técnica, se pueden tener cursos con validez"
good,General Motors is a great company to work for and has a culture where it is very loyal to its employees. The work environment is very fast paced and could be stressful at times due to the being an automotive company where the goal is to remain efficient at all times.
good,The company was very involved in creating a great culture that was comfortable for all employed. The most enjoyable part is being located downtown Detroit right off of the water!
good,"I really only enjoyed the training portion. After that, not for me. Hours were flexible, except from the 2 wk mandatory training that could get you fired if you missed any days."
good,Was never given a straight answer on what the job expectations were.  My yearly goals changed monthly.  It was a bad experience for me due to lack of guidance and expectations.
good,"Work requires a lot of days and weekends.  Not a lot of time at home.  The schedule forces us to work 2 to 3 weekends per month, and only allows for minimal out time."
good,"Fast pace, growing technology. Every vehicle that required service had a different challenging problem. I soon became and expert in troubleshooting, diagnosing and repairing these advanced complex systems. From time I would work on a problem vehicle that had been attempted to be repaired numerous times. It was very satisfying to figure these vehicles out. More importantly the appreciation the customer would typically show."
good,"The work was hard. It caused physical damage to my body.  I had to build a minimum of three hundred trucks a night. Some jobs are not build for shorter people, which made it even more difficult for me to perform."
good,"GM, as with other companies, operate from a regional stand-point.  There will therefore be stark differences between local and US practices such as compensations, rewards and benefits, etc.  This is just specific to the handful of GM employees working for a non-manufacturing region that operates primarily utilizing call centers.  The cultural idea is ""ideal"" and local cultural nuances are still predominantly in play.  Unless there is a single point of leadership in country who will ensure proper execution of culture, one had better be prepared to play local and corporate politics when working for GM."
good,Typowo korporacyjne miejsce pracy -mozliwosci rozwoju zaleznie od zajmowanego stanowiska
good,"I appreciate the company an all it has done for myself and family. Its help me grown as a man, learning to think for myself and work well as a team. It also have me the ability to focus my energy into perfecting my jobs and assignments"
good,Work is very repetitious with very little guidance.Often give tasks and not tools to accomplish requested tasks and yet hold employee accountable.  Very large operation with no real collaboration among teams.  No clear-cut career advancement with often re-organization of teams and departments.  Very strong political game among management.
good,Was not the right Job for me.  travel issue.  Was not really doing the Job I was hired to do.  too long getting the Supplier on board to start the process
good,"Most team leaders were good about helping me understand what to do and how to do it. Once you understand how to perform a task, it's just a matter of repetition. The other employees I worked with were very nice for the most part."
good,"Great pay/benefits. Awesome co workers. Direct managment is great but once your up the chain they dont know what a mechanic actually does or care to learn. Company is constantly going through lay offs, no one ever knows of they are going to have a job to come back to in the next week."
good,"A typical day at GM was strenuous and sometimes stressful. I learned teamwork. No matter how hard things could get(union, line speed up, mandatory overtime) we had to learn to work and support each other. Even it meant walking out during union negotiations. I’m not saying everyone was the best of friends but when it came to our lively hoods we stuck together and fought together. The management could be someone they trained from the floor (your co-worker) with no management experience and not a people person. But the experience, training and pay they became your supervisor. Favoritisms to their friends. We did have some really good supervisors also. The hard part of the job. It is very physical and you stand on feet for 10-12 hours depending on line time. You know what time your shifts going to start but when your going home depends on the quota for the day. So just know you can’t  walk off a production line. Work hours are between 8-12 hour shifts. I started out at 10.65 and after 10 years it was 25.00 dollars and hour. Then they announced the plant was closing. GM is not stable. To many plant closings. If you decide to work there, save your money. Have another means of income. Invest your money outside of GM. So when your plant closes you have other available income. What I like about GM great benefits and pay and comraderie regardless of what GM plant you came from. Wherever I go you have a GM family that is familiar with the struggle. And says hang in there I’ve been there also.   We heard rumors for years that the plant was going to close but we didn’t believe it. They had"
good,buena empresa hasta que se entregó la administración regional a Colombia quienes empeoraron el ambiente laboral y la proyección que uno pude tener en la empresa
good,"At GM it really depends where you land. Some managers are micro managers and others give you all the opportunity to work independently, so if you are lucky you might get a good one."
good,"Lot of red tape , overall products and process need improvement."
good,Personally I had no issues at GM but this is no special place to work. The 401K matching is great and the overall benefits good but other than that just an Ok place to work.
good,Good amount of autonomy and challenging creative environment. Management was very poor and had little to no idea of what was going on from day to day in the job. Very disconnected and amotivational
good,Management picks their favorites and gives them opportunities not provided to other team members. Didn’t really learn anything as no training was provided. Learned everything mainly on my own research and classes after work hours.
good,Very difficult job even though the pay was rewarding. Too far from home. Management like enemies out to get anyone. Hardly anytime for family life. Work 6 days a week.
good,this company will work you a lot but you will be treated better if you are direct hire. If you are contract they do not always stand by what they say when it comes to being treated fair.
good,"Old, union shop with older workforce. Overworked management, stressful. Great pay and benefits. Good place to learn management skills. Culture is not great. Tons of opportunity to learn, old equipment is failing so lots of troubleshooting experience to gain."
good,"I am a contracted employee at General Motors so the review may not be applicable because of that. As a contractor it's been a terrific experience, the experience of trying to become a direct hire after over two and a half years as a contract employee has not been as rewarding, but I love the people I work with in safety data analytics and the work we do."
good,A good place to start if you are new to the workforce or maybe just want to find something to do after your retirement limited availability to grow here
good,Des déplacements aux USA sont à réaliser régulièrement.
good,"Competitive but if you know your skills and talents you can thrive there; the upper management team is not really strong, however GM will be around for a bit. There are lower level managers that still believe in the old school methodology (scare tactics to improve work levels, but all this will do is scare young talent away)"
good,Working at GM was a great experience.  Working at a large corporation and learning many different aspects of the manufacturing business and how innovative technology can be applied to business process improvement.
good,Been mismanaged for years Got behind in the 1980s.Opened the door for all the competition today. Had to spend years trying to catch up. Likes to blame employees for management failures. Mismanagement caused them to go bankrupt.
good,Shift work and very demanding in a high pace environment.  Management is scared of the executives and will throw you under the bus at anytime to get ahead and not get in trouble
good,"Non stop, fast paced manufacturing workplace with production running around the clock to keep up with demand. Not a lot of work life balance, but that is expected with the amount of overtime hours one works."
good,the plan to restructure the company was poorly planned and executed.  a firm to strategically review and execute a change of this magnitude should have been consulted.
good,Its a good place to work when your young. you can learn a lot of skills and how to maintain steady employment. It not the best place for people that dont like a fast paced environment
good,Working for a company who pays well and has a lot to offer but still puts families at risk to be forced to relocate is very hard and can emotionally destroy households. I learned a lot from working with all kinds of people who helped me mold into a great team member work ethic.
good,"General Motors was all about how things looked on paper.  If you clocked in at 6:01 am, all h*ll broke loose, but if you clocked in at 5:55 am and didn't start working until 6:30 am, no problem.  I worked at GM for 30 years and at no point during that time did I ever feel like I was ""In"".  The relationship between management and the hourly workforce was always adversarial and somewhat hostile.  The salaried employees always had an attitude of being ""Better Than"" hourly and ""Real"" GM employees.  The job was fast-paced, stressful and you were constantly bird-dogged by management once the day got started, some with racist intentions.  It was having a young family and the pay that kept me there.  I was told many times, ""It's my way or the highway"", even though I was doing the work.  When I retired, it felt like I had died and went to heaven!  I don't know how I made it."
good,"Overall I enjoyed working for GM.    We had a good team environment where it truly felt like everyone was working towards a common goal.  I spent a good portion of my day in meetings, but most of them were productive and I was able to get my work completed between meetings.   Got laid off during the 15% salary cuts even though it appears that 90% of the cuts happened in IT."
good,The pace is fast and many new employees are not trained allowing frustration in getting goal accomplished. Policies and procedures are complex and many times not necessary which adds to delays. Collaboration is excellent when time is permitted. Management changes often  causing complete refocus of goals and jobs by the team
good,"Apesar de passar por diversas reestruturações nos últimos anos, a General Motors consegue manter o ambiente de trabalho agradável e transparente para os funcionários."
good,I would recommend GM to a friend simply based in the salary and career advancement you have. Very good health care and benefits. Bonuses and time off are very good as well.
good,Ambiente de pressão e competição interna. Precisa melhorar os gerentes e a cultura.
good,Almost half of the management at GM would write you up to make a name for themselves. It was hard to find a trustworthy boss. They preach safety first yet they would have one employee do several jobs at once.
good,The typical work is chill for the most part. I don't know many people that would work over time unless there is a major deadline. Compensation is fine if you are ok with not making a lot with base salary.
good,"The call center job inside the GM building can be very difficult and challenging.  It can also be extremely stressful depending on the customer. Normally this would be welcome, but the pay for such work is too small. The management and culture there is wonderful and the work is never boring"
good,"Em qualquer empresa é possível agregar conhecimentos e se desenvolver. Porém na GM os processos são muito específicos, então tecnicamente não se leva muito para outras experiências."
good,"Typical work day consist of incident resolution, change management and innovation. Most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with great people. Learned patience in following processes."
good,"Overall it is a great company to start with. Additional training is needed. Too many meetings and new programs which is very overwhelming. No job security especially after the recent layoff, leaving all of us in stress."
good,Working at General Motors is exactly as how you would expect it to be working at a Big 3 corporation.    I wish I could say I had a better experience.
good,"overview culture is fine, but some individual manager no good. You better following what your boss said even some of them are not make sense at all. Your boss will revenge you when the company in down turn."
good,Good work environment and people to work with. A lot of changes are made without consulting if the employees want these changes. Very little opportunity for growth out of current position.
good,"Understand that GM is anticipating financial headwind and may have to lay people off."
good,Exciting manufacturing environment - always a new adventure on a daily basis.  Tough times ahead as General Motors continues to reorganize into its new vision.
good,Do what you can with the time you have there. Your success will depend on whether someone teaches you the ropes or not. Try to stay away from infrastructure. Stick with Development and a producing project. You will go a long way.
good,I was able to learn a lot about the automotive industry.  They have a lot of respect for work life balance and the employee during trying times.  They gave me the possibility to learn as much as possible.
good,"Empresa muito boa, pelos seus benefícios e ambiente de trabalho."
good,"The position was okay, however, there was a lot of pressure to meet certain productivity goals.By emphasizing quantity over quality, it almost always resulted in an inferior work product."
good,General motors was a great experience for me when I was a small boy I always wanted to work there and I finally got my shot and it turned out to be a great 10 years to bad it had to end but I have to move on I learned alot
good,"Entered data from car/truck contract purchased into a specialized data base"
good,Every day I had to make sure our parts were in compliance with Their guidelines. A lot of other supplier representative was always looking for new business and ways to make more money so they would go after your job and find ways to make others look bad.
good,Culture at GM has improved.  Sr. Leadership has really put a focused effort on making it a pay-for-performance culture with people being rewarded for their efforts
good,In the time there I experiences three different Studios.  Most of the team I worked with was great.  They were willing to help each other and work together to get the job finished.  There was a lot of talent there.  There was a handful of people that were lazy and did not produce quality work.  It was hard to understand how these people were overlooked by management.  I had four managers who ran their studios differently. My first manager was very ambitious and would encourage new ideas and help each person to better themselves.  Some of the others were so laid back that they let the studio run itself but those who did the work did not get the credit for it.
good,assembly line operation very stressful competitive work when working on line. once you get seniority to get off line the pace slowed down and became a better place to work
good,I worked at general motors for twelve plus years. I met a lot of good people. we used to get great bonuses. the plant decided to close down so four thousands people lost there job. very sad..
good,"it was a decent experience to work for them, to be apart of building engines and cars was really cool, and I learned  lot about the process of how to build them"
good,General supervisor was bias very unfair applied rules that weren't followed and disciplined those he didn't like. Quit two good jobs to come work for them and then I got laid off after 6 weeks
good,"GM provides good pay and benefits, however I've been held as a temporary worker for far too long (3 yrs), experienced lay-offs (5 months) and currently encounters inconsistent working hrs (18-27 hrs/week) which is highly unacceptable."
good,"working is good"
good,"Decent company to work for. You can get your hands on many different technologies. Raises and bonuses are given each year, if the company does well. PTO is honor system with 20 days. Matching 4% 401k."
good,I can't really give a review for this company as the vast majority of the work I did was in their paint shop. I imagine your typical employee having different forms of work.
good,"Great vacation, 401k matching, sick days, insurance. Pay is okay, about average for the area. The work culture and day to day is not great.  No support from upper management , re-orgs constant, silo-ed work environment between business and IT."
good,Ok place to work but the ups and downs of the automotive industry are difficult.  The work life balance is tenuous.  The expectations to work long hours and weekends is difficult.
good,"It can be  a cool place to work, it all depends on what location you get put or who your working with. If you are paired up with the right group of people it can be a fun place to work."
good,I am a contract employees and I've been here roughly 3months. I really like working here. It has a relaxed and friendly environment. Only thing is the Auto industry is unstable.
good,This is a great company to work for if you have an engineering background.  Resources are very tight so it can be challenging to get things done unfortunately.  Advancement opportunities are also very difficult to obtain.
good,The GM IT center in Austin is a fun work environment. Everything is new with a very 21st century approach to a tech-oriented work environment. My only complaint would be the management at GM IT. It seemed I was pulled into a different project every month with no clear direction for anything.
good,"For those lucky enough to be on their fast track, there are a lot of opportunities to work in different areas of the company and learn. For others not as much - can stay in a dept for a very long time.  Very political culture and stuck in their own ways of doing things."
good,"Learned a lot, but I was told I would be hired as a software developer for a Java position and then I got stuck in DataStage ETL tool.  Hard to escape ETL if you want to do real software development."
good,"Typical day at work:  Many meetings, some time for focused work"
good,as a line inspector the job was extremely fast pace you had to be aware because there was a lot going on and not paying attention could result to injury .
good,Heavy work load  the company really press on sales and reviews breaks and lunch are limited to very minimal uses leaving your desk to use the restroom is considered a part of your daily breaks so you must be time conscious.
good,"It is usually a very stable job."
good,"A typical work day at GM consists of maybe 1 status meeting and/or Defect triage and review.  Our team members were responsible for deploying a detailed, statistical and graphical status report daily.  Management was very hands on.  The work place was somewhat quiet to be located in a warehouse.  The hardest part of the job was completing the status and the work."
good,"I work with hard work people, However, I want to advance my career further and it seems like its not happening as fast as I would like it to be. That is why Im looking outside of the company for some thing that I can grow my career."
good,"Toledo gm is a good place to work if you have a good attitude and a good work ethic. No nonsense atmosphere. Fast pase, most days start at 5am with a safty meeting. Safty comes first. Most days you work 10 to 12 days three shifts. Most areas has a minimum of 10 and a maximum 50 people from all walks of life trying to feed there families. The lighting in the plant is very good. Also floors are cleans."
good,"Though I've increased my skill set and learned much, my current role is not representative of the description I received at the time of my interview.  At times, my skill set is wasted conducting other job functions that are not related to my position.  Travel requirements were vastly misrepresented at the time of my interview.  The primary location of my employment with round trip travel time, as well as the impending likelihood of extended travel requirements have lead me to look in to other employment opportunities."
good,"Takes forever to get anything done across teams and there is no effort to align priorities across teams and integration. Benefits are good and work life balance is achievable. Management is all across the board. Some are just warm bodies, some are manipulative and condescending and some are very good."
good,"Hard job but worth the money. Building can become very hot, especially during the summer. Staff is usually pretty nice and understanding. Job also come with lots of benefits."
good,I enjoyed working at the company.  The work life balance was difficult because a lot is expected but I enjoyed the work and time.  Most coworkers were a pleasure to work with.
good,Have been working there for 4 years now.  A great and safe place to work. I have enjoyed my time and have learned lots. I am ready to move on and to learn more skills!
good,Big differences between locations and expectations/exposure. Higher raises/bonuses not based on performance - most of it is arbitrary unless you're really liked.
good,Empresa boa para se trabalhar e que exige bastante conhecimento de seus funcionários. A GM foi uma faculdade de Finanças para mim.
good,"Purchasing is highly structured and everything is to a highly structured process.  Individual knowledge of commodities is not valued, just adherence to the process.  This means a ""certified"" buyer with 1 year of experience is just as valuable as a buyer with 20 years of experience and can be moved to any commodity at any time without problems...in theory.  "
good,This was a part time job.The job was only for college students.This job could never go full time.there were no real benefits.They did have flexible work schedules
good,Just an average production environment.  Went through 3 plant closings and 3 relocations. No relocation options available after 3rd plant closed.    Retired.
good,"This company offered long-term, full time employment with pension and benefits and reasonable health and safety practices at a time when the country was experiencing a major recession.  For this I am thankful for General Motors of Canada."
good,"If you choose t work for GM, the best way to go is full time. Temps get no paid off days and they looked down upon majority of the time when requesting time off.  Temps pay Union Dues yet they are not part of the Union which means if anything happens the Union does not protect or represent temps. Temps are over worked for way less pay and will be placed on the same job(s) as a full time employee. You have the option to become full time only if GM decides to hire full time workers however, majority of the temp workers will remain temp until GM decides to lay them off. My advice would be to temps is to not get comfortable and always be looking for a better opportunity. That way you are not stuck without a paycheck once GM decides to lay you off."
good,"Ingresé en Finanzas seis meses más tarde de lo que debería haberlo hecho y durante los casi dos años que estuve en la empresa, nunca pude ponerme adelante de los temas por la intensidad y variedad de cosas acompañada de una gran velocidad y una estructura desbordada (ésto es relativo a Finanzas y en la época que yo trabajé, 1995 / 1997). Aprendí mucho, pero a los ponchazos, porque la cantidad de cuestiones a cubrir nunca terminaba. Los ejecutivos eran todos extranjeros (un poco por ser un ""start up"" y otro poco por la cultura de la compañía), y su nivel de conocimiento era muy remarcable, pero lamentablemente no lo podíamos aprovechar. La cultura era muy poco estable por ser una empresa en formación, ahora se notaba muy corporativa. Lo que más me gustó fue ser parte de algo que estaba arrancando y tener mucha interacción con líderes, aportando valor."
good,I really enjoyed working in Integration Infotainment.  It's just hectic at times.  However if you want to learn a lot this was a good department to be in.
good,The workplace was very interesting to say the least. Co-workers were  friendly and laid back. The work was steady and no time for slackers to just sit back.
good,General Motors is a fast-paced environment that is great for new college hires to learn and carve out their future. I've met many individuals how have worked for GM for over 25 years and they still enjoy coming to work every day.
good,"Good culture. They provide a plethora a learning materials. They encourage you to move around but it seems limited to horizontally, it's very hard to get promoted."
good,"Days at work where fun it’s a fast moving environment but fun work at the same time, managers where great always out on the floor helping . You have to stand in 1 spot for 8 hours priming windows as it comes down the line u have a certain time to get that window primed Before it drops an moves down the line"
good,"Though i was always on time and back from breaks early, management could care less. They were in the union's pocket and played favorites, giving the best jobs to union's ""friends"" in the plant. They harassed workers who needed to schedule a day off but ignored the poor performance of the union flunkies."
good,Un equipo de trabajo dispuesto a dar todo su aporte profesional y ademas en un clima de armonía y confianza.
good,"I was led on to believe that my skills and grow were good, however when it came time for a full time offer they rejected me on the base that my performance was below acceptable"
good,"I Learned new skills while on the job. Accomplished my RD creds to install software from the servers on shared drive, reset windows passwords, and etc"
good,"I was working with intelligent, hardworking engineers that shared the goal of engineering a well put together vehicle."
good,GM is a huge company. I only worked there for about a year. They prioritize official credentials over actual ability/talent. Good management. An ok place to work.
good,Writing MATLAB code to create tools to automate processes other engineers do manually. It saved 100s of man hours and it reduced human error. I enhanced my GUI  MATLAB skills. The workplace culture is relaxed for the most part. The hardest part of the job is getting noticed on how I am automating mundane work in Excel. The most enjoyable part of the job is when my algorithm takes thousands or thousands data points and perform data analysis on each data point and kicks out a report with graphs and statistical values for each data set that saved the engineer nearly 4 hour worth or work when he or she could do it in 2 mins.
good,"Overall view of my typical work day would be as follows:"
good,If you want to work in a plant environment  this is a job for you. Alot of overtime if you want it. And plenty of good people to work with. Your trained to do your job
good,GM had good benefits but the pay was a little low and required a lot of hours. The culture was good and the fellow employee were good. I learned a lot and they had good training.
good,"I really enjoyed many years with General Motors/Modern Engineering as a contract employee. Unfortunately, I was laid off and never called back as they changed the process for contract employees."
good,"A lot of overtime, work environment is decent, co-workers can be a hassle, pay is great, work is easy you just have to have the right mind set, come in with a good attitude and be ready to work"
good,"Great product to be involved with"
good,"A company that everyone has heard of, I was in the lucky position to be working on some really cool projects.  I put in long hours working with a great team of excellent people on pioneering technology."
good,"Saturn was a good company to work for. Raises were given for ""time in grade"". This was a union company so fairness was required from management. Enjoyed co-workers."
good,"General Motors is an outstanding american manufacturer. "
good,"fast paced "
good,I have had to relocate 3 times. That can be very stressful.  I have also had to leave my family behind when relocating. The pay and benefits are good. Over time is forced on many occasions. I have learned a lot while working here. Many skills apply outside of work.
good,Some people are kept incredibly busy while some have super slow days at work. They really need to improve their management system. Benefit was considerably good.
good,"GM was a great company to work for and I enjoyed my managers. Very understanding people and cool co-workers. Very laid back company in terms of work / hours / vacations. I feel like even higher in the chain, GM has some political issues and issues with being loyal to employees that have worked there for some time. Many times employees are surpassed by new, young, and inexperienced workers because of a internship program or something along those lines. In other words, job security / moving up in the company doesn't seem to be the strength over at GM. I don't think they have it right. I was contracted there for 2.5 years and people began to get let go. We were told by management that nobody else will be let go anytime soon, next thing you know, another wave of lay offs due to budget cuts. Tread carefully in this company, you could be let go in the blink of an eye."
good,"Good work-life balance with good benefits. Good immediate management, but further up the ladder, seem to loose focus. Lack of ""sense of urgency"" is pervasive throughout the entire organization."
good,"Call center environment outbound and inbound calls with customers who are having issues of their delinquent"
good,"Working with a crew of different people daily. Some days we are working at a fast pace, some days work is slow. Overall not a bad place of work. Outside working in the cold can get the best of you if you are not dress properly"
good,"On a given day, management is not fully engaged and when they are won't provide the direction needed to be successful. We are self-governed as a team and set our own assignments and priorities. Leadership tends to play favorites and recognized the ""favorite"" employees instead of acknowledging those who really do the work."
good,Work place that is distinguished by the good service it presents. Good salary for employees and good compensation for these. Mutual respect between manager and employee including good communication between the two.
good,I liked working there and it was good but there was not much room for advancement overall. I would recommend them as they are a big company and tend to be nice to employees. But overall i liked working there.
good,A typical work day would be technical support for GM products. Great work place and friendly environment. hardest part of my job would be lack of communication and unorganization.
good,"Guaranteed salary and health benefits.  Boring and repetitive, building 59 cars per hour.  Worked nights.  We were so busy and no time to make friends in the work place."
good,"Good   Environment,     Enjoyed    my   job. The people i worked with was very nice and helpful when i first started the job on training me on what to do"
good,"hours were long uaw was difficult, culture was one sided individuals were very competitive.  Time off was great.  Money was excellent, learned how to deal with difficult individuals,"
good,"You start as a temp, bouncing from job to job, you're basically the work horse for the company. The pay is decent as a temp but you just gotta shut up, keep your head down and work to become a seniority. (approx 8 months). As seniority the union has you. The union is solid. They work to get you good pay, and they generally get it. Great benefits, and honestly if you avoid any an all management its peaceful. That said, avoid management. Management is the stress, to them you are a number, replaceable piece of trash that failed in life so hard that now you work for them, and they will let you know it. They do a poor job of running the plant, then blame the lowest man on the totem pole (you). If you're good with that, you'll do fine."
good,"Great company to work with if you really want a global exposure. Got opportunities to work with the chinese, korean teams as a part of project. They have established sets of rules for every section, so there is very less scope of innovation at the workspace."
good,"GM is moving in the right direction as far as cars are concerned and its exciting to work with EVs and Autonomous Vehicles, but much of the management is stuck managing the same way that the company has been for 50 years. This just doesn't work for the new workforce and doesn't mesh well with millennials."
good,Every day you will learn something new at the job. There is definitely a lot of different departments starting to emerge within the company. If you work hard enough you'll get to where you want to be.
good,"Nearly no chance for advancement, not even to full time status; however they treat you like full time by working you indefinitely and as many hours as they please. They just don't give benefits, vacation days, seniority, good pay or timely raises."
good,The typical work day starts very quick with brief informational and strategy meeting to operate from during the day.  The work culture is also quick and adjust to starting with intermittent trouble but quick moving.  The most enjoyable time for me is seeing the great results from strategic thinking and response to issues as the day  unfolds.
good,loading and unloading parts from trucks driving a sit down forklift through out the warehouse picking up extra debris in the warehouse and helping in other departments
good,"Good company to work for...I was actually a contractor for Vector SCM and Logistics Insights , located at the Shreveport LA and Arlington TX facilities respectively."
good,I have no comments to write about my job at GM.  It was a job that allowed me to work part time and offered good benefits.  Met some really good people.
good,I liked the work until i stopped being able to spend time with family.  The union was the worst aspect of it because they never worked for you.  You paid them for nothing more than to treat you like trash.
good,Nice place to work and good pay. Always lots of over time whenever it is needed. obvious issue is the company general motors is not dependable for constant employment.
good,"GM is a lot like other manufacturing environments where it isn't necessarily how good you are at your job, but how much work can they get out of you for free. If manufacturing is your only choice of jobs, GM probably isn't a bad company to work at. But it takes a toll both mentally and physically."
good,Be ready to abide by the rules of the union contract. No wavering from it. long days and lots of weekend work. you will be forces to work weekends and 12 hour days.
good,"The line I was working at had each task being done in about 30 seconds. This is TOUGH when you first start but once you get used to it you can do the jobs asleep. It becomes muscle memory. Which makes it easy to get distracted also so stay alert. Details matter, people are trusting their lives and a several thousand dollar investment in the quality of work you perform, and GM knows that so they don't let problem people slip too far. Most importantly be on time, all the time. There's ZERO tolerance for attendance. But as long as you're on time, do your job well, work with a good team, and have good leadership, GM is GREAT place to work, if you can take the physical demands and stress of layoffs."
good,"Esta empresa muy activa y solidad , lastima q la situación del país la obligó a darse a la quiebra.  La cultura de ser todos una gran familia no funciono. No hubo comunicación últimamente."
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced and team-oriented meaning that in order for the next team to do their job on the assembly line, the team before must assemble parts correctly or it will stop the line which costs the company money. Management are bad at communicating and training can be either from horrible to great depending on team, team leader, trainer, group and shift leader. The hardest part of the job is adapting to all the changes that occur too often and sometimes learning certain jobs that require large tools or robots."
good,"Meu primeiro emprego, trabalho operacional. Necessita algumas melhorias"
good,was handling the OPEL brand in Dubai market which was not a volume seller but still got good achievements and learned about a different product..enjoyed too.
good,"Great place to train, however it is not great for career movers. That want to take on more responsibilities and enhance their internal and external value."
good,"i enjoyed working here for many different reasons but management did everything it could to ruin the experience. also, i worked there for two years, missed 0 days, i wasn't late a single time, and rarely ever came across a job i couldnt learn, but still failed to progress in the company. everything is based off of seniority and i feel like their overall system isnt all that great."
good,"faliu por culpa dos gestrores, muita discordia nas administracoes da empresa"
good,"Working at GM was a pleasant experience. GM is a company that is doing a great job at trying to create a culture that people will enjoy coming to. The degree of difficulty doing certain jobs is high, but the compensation is great."
good,i worked here during my co-op work assignments during college.  I then wrote an undergraduate thesis to complete my Bachelor's degree.  Great experience in the metal casting industry
good,The Innovation at GM is exciting and challanging. learning is at a fast pace . Changes are extrodinary. fast  with operations and technology at an all  time high.the hardest part of the environment is to learn  who you need to contact to get the best results.
good,"I Love My Work Environment, I Just Wish They Never Would Have Closed Down.I like my coworkers,also my boss.I also loved coming to work an everybody had a positive attitude even when things were going bad it was a very comfortable place to work."
good,"Too much work"
good,GM was a very great place to work. i didnt work directly for GM. i worked under a contracted employment company. The job position was fast passed and very customer based.
good,"Unsure of what benefits and salary I would have received had I worked directly for General Motors, but unfortunately, I was contract who worked onsite at GM only."
good,"Empresa en la que pude aplicar mis conocimientos como auxiliar contable, y como asistente administrativo."
good,"Variety of work"
good,beside the management this isn't abad job good pay benefits are excellent but with automotive industry when it good its good and when its bad its bad that's it
good,"o trabalho na empresa era ótimo porque eles tinha muito cuidado com os  funcionários,eu aprendi muito com a empresa sobre segurança e comportamento de trabalho,a minha gerencia era muito legal , presente os nossos colegas de trabalho era time trabalhavam em equipe e o trabalho era produtivo e a parte mais difícil era quando a maquina quebrava e atrasava toda produção e nos ficava preocupado com a qualidade e a parte mais agradável  era quando o time conseguia  controla toda a produção atrasada com qualidade."
good,The unions and too much influence over day to day operations and those directly employed by the union are VERY lazy. Work is good but not everyone pulls their weight...
good,"When I worked in Moraine, OH we were very close, like family. When I temporarily worked in the Arlington, TX plant, it was a little friendly. What I learned was what type of supervisor NOT to be. There was a lack of patience and sensitivity. The hardest part about the job was keeping up with the continuously moving line. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the transformation as the vehicle was being constructed and the finished product and the GM factory smell and atmosphere. It reminded me of home."
good,I was able to earn a journeyman card and get and education. The compensation and benefits were very good. Being a closed union shop however severely limited my ability to gain experience in all departments.
good,Faurecia is a good place to work. As long as you can handle the work you will ok. We do the doors for the Cadillac cts and ats. My co-works are some of the best people I have worked with in a long time.
good,"Very fast pace keeps you active,Union shop keeps your job safe .shifts go by quickly and as long as your OK with a bit of hohum, you will be fine.your team means everything/"
good,general motors was a fun and sometime hectic place. I enjoyed working with and getting to know some wonderful people. I really enjoyed assembling cars and management was nice and fair.
good,"good work place"
good,Foram 15 anos de muito trabalho e aprendizado. Empresa que me orgulho muito de ter trabalhado.
good,"Management is very knowledgeable.  Everyone is friendly and willing to help out.  The team concept is very strong here, which makes for an enjoyable work day"
good,"Typical day at work: Constantly answering phone calls all day, dealing with customer inquires and issues. "
good,"Lots of young people, I met my long term friends there.  Almost all were temps.  This facility, Cadillac division, has since been torn down so it is no longer in existence.  Their A/P department was so big that each person was was responsible for vendors starting with a certain letter.  Mine was ""M"".  Hectic but fun"
good,"General Motors did provide me with a good living provided adequate vacation time health benefits.  I must say though that I had a great experience doing all the  various jobs  starting out in  the body shop department, the paint department and then the trim department.  I learned a lot about cars working in the various departments and I'm grateful for that ."
good,Great opportunity but being let go because of temp status and senior union workers transferring in.  Ran what was considered the most difficult operation in machining.  Very mentally and physically challenging.  Second shift is difficult for family life.
good,"GM gives one a decent work-life balance but if you are keen to grow professionally, then this is not the right place at the current scenario. Even the businesslearning opportunities are low"
good,Trabajo estable bueno pero siemore es estar todo el tiempo bajo presion
good,"Working in customer service was very rewarding. To be able to take a customer from being upset or concerned and to be able to work with them, and the company to provide a solution was a great feeling."
good,"I loved working for GM, they trained us with everything we needed.  The people and atmosphere was a great place to work. The future advancements just was not there.  I loved working with the QS9000 team and the management."
good,GM was a fun company to work for.  Got lots of experience i wouldn't have gotten elsewhere.  This was my first real industry job and taught me a great deal  I would have stayed there if I hadn't moved to New York.
good,Trabalho duro e compensador para formação profissional principalmente em relação a relacionamento interpessoal
good,"I worked there right after the bail out and it was a challenge.  GM did not have enough resources to do the work, their motto was pack it on to see how much people will do.  The lack of infrastructure, controls, automation, morale made everyone's job more difficult - truly more like hard labor.  It was a learning experience as I was challenged to really think out of the box in finding creative ways to fix and implement needed controls and workarounds."
good,Uma empresa que investe no treinamento e compra de ferramentas para que o profissional execute o serviço da melhor maneira possível.
good,"GM is always working with the latest frameworks and trying to innovate. In that sense GM is great. You are not tied to legacy systems and they are open to using new technologies. "
good,"I worked from home as part of the Quality Assurance Team for GM. They ended this program which out thousands of us out of work, but the time I was there was fantastic."
good,"This is a very large company that has many moving parts. The brand General Motors speaks for itself. This job works with many vendors, and the general public."
good,Salaried management and Union have different agendas. Lots of hostility among workers on the floor.  Most of the times good place to work. High focus on time management.  Nice to have an opportunity to learn different jobs. Having to learn jobs in a short period was difficult at times.
good,The hardest part of this job is the long hours working the weekends every weekend. Trying to balance home life and work life becomes difficult but the job comes with good compensation and benefits.
good,"it was a busy day there, i learned a lot about the tooling trade and enjoyed working there. it was a good experience.  There wasnt alot of over time available, so I left to find a job to supply me overtime."
good,"it was a very faced paced environment, which I liked because it made time go by faster. there is no job security because you are a temp until people want to retire"
good,"I was a temporary employee and there was no job security. Once you become permanent though, that is when all the amazing benefits kick in!"
good,"GM was a full time position with benefits. Also, located in the same city I live in. This company is no longer in business."
good,A good place to learn but not security to attached a permanent position. I learn a lot for Sys programmer in the Mainframe. Good team but no direction from the management team.
good,"I think I have a good job with this company. I can count on the stability with this job. and the bonus makes up for a lot most of the time. I think its a good job"
good,"Trainer for gm was inadequate"
good,"This is an easy place to work easy hours "
good,I liked the fact that I was on my feet and busy but received a 10 minute break every 2 hours.  If you needed help with some problem on your job they were right there to solve the problem with you for you to achieve your goals.
good,"Las cargas de trabajo son ajenas a el área, en general solo buscan, satisfacer las necesidades de un área en exclusiva para poder modificar los tops 10 que les causen problemas como área común. por lo que solo cuidan el taller donde pertenece el laboratorio. "
good,Empresa com grande infra-estrutura que possibilita uma visão global referente a desenvolvimento de novos produtos.
good,It's a fun place to work with the exception that the HR policies are absolutely inflexible when it comes to working hours and being physically present at work from 8am to 5pm. I also learned that most of the positions are offered to individuals who have some prior acquaintance with a member of management team.
good,"I spent 29 year there but as you can imagine, factory work (I was a skilled tradesman) has its pros and cons. It was a good, steady income but the frustration of limitations and silly expectations from the union-management environment was constricting. I worked the minimum to draw a ""pension"" and called it quits to pursue other interests."
good,"Devido as condições do mercado, tornou-se de praxe todas as cobranças serem acerca das dificuldades de se encontrar um emprego fora da empresa."
good,The hardest part is getting use to standing on your feet all day besides that you will be ok. Its best to use this as a stepping stone if you have no intent advancing further into the company.
good,I typical day at GM is overly stressful.  They never had our pay correct or on time.  They seem to not have the best interest in mind for their employees.
good,"Great job environment and least micromanagent-Liberal,but needs more organized management.It has been great experience of OEM for me and it is so systmatic."
good,"At first the job was great and I was given plenty of hours and jobs to do. I was trained on three jobs on my team and then was left alone for the rest of the summer (there were seven jobs on my team in total that everybody other than me was trained on). I then stopped receiving shifts at the end of the summer and left wondering why. I was finally able to contact the head of Employee Relations after several weeks of not receiving shifts, and I was told I was being fired for poor performance. I was never informed of this beforehand and I was never given a chance to recorrect my behaviour."
good,"This job was just off the wall i enjoyed the people my boss was bomb.com she taught me things i still use to this day."
good,"Work culture is pretty nice but a few people are very stupid and dont have work ethics . As an Electrical Engineer you will get to see a lot of Electrical benches , how they work and how they are built"
good,"Um local adequado para um bom desenvolvimento das funções, liberdade pra opinar e dar sugestões. Tive variados cursos para melhorar meu desempenho no meu setor de trabalho."
good,N/A closed in 2010. it was line work for GM. nothing more to say other than it was steady work with your everyday duties. clean and safe place to work
good,"Delivering world class customer service to customers in English, German and Spanish. Not only do we deliver excellent service, but we also provide emergency services and save lives."
good,"Poor Job work/life balance - average about one weekend off a month with some days that equal over 12 hours. Typical manufacturing environment, all emphasis is put on running production. You almost have sell your soul for a vacation. The most enjoyable part of this is the money. GM does compensate you very well but money only goes so far when you never see your family."
good,"Discuss cases w/ local counsel"
good,"É uma boa empresa, principalmente pelo salário e benefícios."
good,"It is a good place to work.  It is establish now."
good,"The automotive environment is competitive and demanding. The hardest part of my job is balancing the information demands of my many customers. Typical day is 8-10 hours, I eat at my desk because workload is so demanding. Daily meetings, because were global you will be on the phone at night. Great co-workers."
good,This plant is running 6 days a week and 24 hours a day.  The product is in high demand so upper management is very intense on providing the throughput and quality to meet this demand.
good,Cool place to work. A lot of layoffs so plenty of time to travel. Its also random you might be working you might not be they typically tell you a few weeks in advance and sometimes they don't.
good,fun place to work with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. lots of red tape and politics
good,Fast Paced production facility that supplied a very popular product to the marketplace.  Production ran 24 / 7 and there was little downtime.  Very demanding production schedule made time management extremely important.
good,It was very Unorganized. Only care was cost and not quality. not a good work environment. No real management. Follows rules sometimes.
good,Manage up and you will be fine. Set clear expectations with manager about what you want to move and advance in or they will block you.
good,"Achive confudence leve of handle of team & product."
good,"Its OK job,   not much room for advancement,   looking to better myself so i can support my wife and kids better.  Typical Factory work, very monotonous.   Wouldst recommend someone to this job unless they were interested in this type of work"

good,"Eu tive a oportunidade de aprender bastante, trabalhando em vários setores e tive a oportunidade de ter várias ponto de vistas de como funciona o processo de produção, atuando diretamente na produção até a área de Engenharia, onde todo o processo de como os veículos será produzido, começa a ser feito."
good,Currently I have a wonderful Job that I enjoy doing on a daily basis. My day consists of calls and various other tasks that have to be completed on my shift.
good,Worked there for 7 or 8 yrs  Went to General Motors to make more money  Teledyne built therme electric and hydrogen generators
good,"General Motors Defense is among the first few companies where I encountered accomplished engineers who were limited in their skills and potential by the limitations of the academic curriculum they attended, revealing to me the firsthand the shortfall with the old physics and mathematics that graduates of ABET subject matter endure.  This is one of the first occasions where the shortfall became somewhat confrontational.  Good company located in an especially nice area, well managed, enjoyable work atmosphere."
good,The management are uncaring and the employees use to be great people to work with but over time have become unfriendly. Job security is very low.
good,"Dias calmos e outros complicados."
good,"High Pressure to learn and do your job as fast as humanly possible. Which I enjoyed but others might not. A typical day consist of building cars, for myself I installed doors on the Vehicles."
good,"Assembly line work is not for everyone.  That said, the pay is fantastic for work that is simple.  The trouble is that repetitive work is boring and bad for your body."
good,Meet a lot of intresting people. gained a lot of knowledge about the automobile industry. the technology was very impressive in the manufacturing of an automobile.
good,"Great place to work, but you will work hard. New hires work the hardest. If you can survive the layoffs, the comp/benefits are worth it."
good,"Busy, fun, sometimes stressful yet manageable day. I worked 12-13 hours a day. The most enjoyable part of this job was knowing that I resolved my clients issues on their account."
good,"Design Release Engineer, Warren, Michigan"

good,"It was more like a compliance project to remove all the heavy metals from the parts of the car."
good,"Learnt a lot about the automotive domain."
good,"I cant speak for all GM plants but this was what I took away from the Ft Wayne, IN plant. Its incredibly hard to get your foot in the door and once you do its a pretty lengthy process before you're actually working. I was a temp for 14 months with the impression I was going to be hired in but was eventually laid off anyway despite getting an award for reporting quality defects and saving the company loads of money. Good pay but no benefits and still had to pay dues to the local union hall without any real representation as a temp. The extremely fast pace was a real challenge at first but co-workers were a big help and eventually I got used to it and enjoyed it. Made some pretty good friends too. Upper and middle management are often a mess of miss-communication and way more concerned about the bonuses they receive for higher numbers than the quality or well-being of any of the employees. Overall its not a bad place but its got some serious issues that need resolved. Maybe they pay well enough so you'll look the other way."
good,It is a good place to learn but slow growth for your career. Management is good but it is not responsible for your growth
good,"Man Management "
good,"Bom clima de trabalho, bom ambiente e boas condições. Recebe muitas influências americanas e a produção tanto administrativa quanto de produção devem ser em bom nível, e com baixo volume de pessoas. A parte mais agradável de estar nesta empresa, é os desafios, e o desenvolvimento pessoal que ela proporciona. O aprendizado tem sido contínuo e a boa relação com os gestores tem acelerado o processo de desenvolvimento."
good,"Agitado."
good,"Entreprise quittée en 2002 , l'avis ne peut etre pris en compte"
good,A typical day on the consolidated assembly line included approximately 325 vehicles being worked on per shift. Jobs are planned and timed by ergonomic consultants that determine how much work can be done by one person safely on each car. Every second is accounted for and employees are pushed to the limit on a lot of jobs.

good,"ambiente regular , aprendi mucho sobre seguridad e higiene y a organizacion y orden del trabajo"
good,"It was a challenging company to work for at that time, however I have learned so much skills there, like Co2 and Spot Welding, Metal Finishing, Bonnet Fitment as well as Health and Safety course. The management style was not very good since it was characterized by discrimination of individuals and favoritism of skin color. However we had brilliant co- working relationship with my fellow team members, the hardest part was the enforcement and the subjection of workers to work long hours but given only 30 minutes to have their Lunch, having to run to the cafeteria and be standing in long cues, which forced us eat while we walk towards our production lines. I will never forget that. The most enjoyable part of our job, was that the Company allowed us to learn and educate our selves as employees, also to participate in other programs like Sport and Recreation, Health and Safety issues in the work place, HIV and Aids awareness and so on."
good,General Motors has been the worlds largest car manufacturer for a great many years. It is owned by a series of share holders that in my opinion interfere with its ability to adapt to the newer world markets.They are in a state of transition between old world and new.At my time of employ they were having trouble embracing the new world ways of manufacturing. I hope that they survive in the future for the sake of all of us.They have produced some truly iconic vehicles.They like any other company have good and bad in them.
good,"GM has not staffed up for aggressive prototype build schedules. Co-workers were great, management was somewhat out of touch."
good,I also have a strong knowledge of the quality control procedures which insures customer satisfaction.  I worked with all levels of the organization to make my area efficient and meet the production needs on a daily basis.
good,assembly line work - no room to advance to a better job for the first 10 years or so - people great to work with - management like many other companies mix of good and bad - hardest part is the boredom associated with repetitive work
good,"working as asafety & fire exp, tool box talk, work permit & site supervison."
good,It was a contract nurse position I got to work if a GM nurse was off work. I went from plant to plant in the Dayton area I enjoyed working at the different locations.
good,To large a company. It was fun and there was always something new happening. Until they filed bankruptcy.
good,"Working in a cold envirement,communicate oraly and in writing part failures or problems to technicians. Moving and charging batteries at charging  station. Pushing vehicle with push trucks performing oil changes. I consider myself a people person and my co-workers are not comfortable to ask me for help. The hardest part of the job would be driving in stormy weather. What I enjoyed the most is that I spend a lot of time driving and working outdoors."
good,"A typical day at work is spent trying to make forward progress on projects in which leveraged teams and stakeholders are key to the projects success. Obtaining project funding can be very difficult and onerous. There are always many competing interests for resources. Your projects may not always align with the priorites of other projects, depending on the IT verticals priorities and your dependencies on them."
good,I loved my job when except the last 2 years. Got new management and they did not live up to the expectations as being in management.
good,I worked the line. How to assemble things on A moving line. I had foremen's some good some bad. Worked with many different folks some good some bad some in between. Hours of boring work standing on cement or steel . Sometimes I would get A repair job which was good. But when I got enough time in to get A good job at GM they where always cutting back.
good,"•	Responsible for new vehicle launches."
good,It's a giant manufacturing plant and my role didn't fit my abilities or goals.
good,very nice company. top level management is very nice. all is good
good,"Generally an easy going culture in engineering support.  A typical day may include testing and data analysis.  Learned tons of  business processes from outside supplier PO processing to internal lab management and reporting,   Management are mainly people leaders except a few.  Co-workers very helpful and source of fun.  Hardest part of job is adjusting to different communicative styles running the breath of the organization from Powertrain to Vehicle. Most enjoyable part of job is getting to work on varied range of tasks related to product or support."
good,"Empresa agradável e funcionários compromissados, diretoria ausente e gerencia despreparada."
good,worked on lot of interesting projects. leaned software implementation in auto industry. very good team and manager.
good,"I worked independently, The skilled equipment was out dated, but workable for the type of work done; plus or minus a hammer handle. I found many dangerous pranks played, usually against me. Prejudices ran amok with little regard to the law. I felt my skillset being diminished over time, due to being constantly under duress. Not only did I feel trapped in a well paying job, my health started suffering. Although I am a fighter, it was a no win situation. This is only my opinion due to my unique situation. "
good,"a lot of overtime, but well compensated for the time."
good,"agradável de trabalhar, colegas de trabalho prestativos."
good,"working with a team that was always willing to help out. job was fast pace which many for a fast night, while some nights where slow. being part of making and the process of gm trucks, was amazing."
good,"Good company to work for, a lot of opportunity for growth and knowledge.  Everything is there for career growth.  It is up to you how far you go Compensation is good.  They have a great mentoring program for leadership."

good,"Some jobs are easier than others, but it's nice only being responsible for your job. Management is fine if you are there to work. Great co-workers."
good,"Work environment was fast-paced and energetic"
good,"Nos meus 7 anos de GM aprendi e cresci muito na área de TI, tendo oportunidades de atuar como coordenador de TI e Gerente de Projetos, nas áreas de Computing e Telecom. Minha Gerencia era muito boa e os muitos colegas de trabalho, tínhamos um relacionamento muito bom."
good,it was good while it lasted. My first full time job. we worked hard til they cut back but we did get buyouts .
good,Worked with suppliers to package styled switches into new vehicles. Learned about the engineering release process. Got along great with by boss and later team-lead. Got a long very well with coworkers. The hardest part of the job was that it was not technically challenging or fulfilling. I felt I was loosing my design skills. There tended to be a lot of documentation and very long meetings. The most enjoyable part was the semi-frequent trips and the people I worked with.
good,It was a great company to work for. Working with dealers and seeing them grow off the work you have done was very rewarding.
good,"worked assembly building cars. worked in a parts plant building auto parts. learned how to set uo machines. keeping a machine runnung smooth,replacing parts and setting up machiner"
good,I learned a lot about being salaried supervisor of skilled tradesmen in a union environment...
good,Employees work well together. Managers are strict on production.
good,This is a nice place for work / life balance. You have a predictable schedule.
good,Small company feel. they advertise it as not contract work but it is an engineering services contract which is essentially the same as contract work.
good,Working at the lab testing Autoparts using different Instrumental Analisys Equipment.
good,Iniciava o dia com uma reunião de cinco minutos para falar de segurança. fazia inspeção dá área(agrupamento dos materiais) ajudava no recebimento e dava baixa no sistema.
good,I enjoyed the multi-tasking and speaking with various people. The job was fast paced which made the day go by quickly.
good,"This job was a great experience, all in all it was a very good opportunity to learn and grow from!"
good,Kept busy
good,"Fast paced environment where decision are critical to customer satisfaction. Leader of 25+ employees, improving daily productivity, reducing cost, and meeting metrics."
good,Maintain robotics in welding production areas.
good,I have learned a great deal in quality when dealing with the assembly of a variety of cars/parts. I fully enjoyed working with the people at General Motors.
good,Big company mores.
good,I worked on the assembly line doing various jobs.
good,working with a cost saving group with high expectations was a good experience. learned alot about where OEM's had lost money over the years.
good,"Too busy & too fasted paced, Management did not always agree with workers & vise verse, too many internal conflict and not enough team work."
good,"The variety of machines and technology we cover seems endless. With minimal training, minimal direction, there is tremendous pressure to maintain equipment with minimal down time."
good,"Pay should take into account factors that affect your pay, that you have no control over. Regional factors should also be considered in determining a fair pay plan."
good,"El ambiente de trabajo es bueno, aunque los horarios que se manejan no permiten tener un equilibrio entre la vida personal y laboral."
good,"Typical corporate culture - either very busy or stand still. Some opportunity for advancement and overtime, but limited.Overall, quite a reasonable place to work."
good,"You have to keep up with the line speed. If you can't complete vehicle in timely manner, you will get written up. Most jobs are overloaded. There are also height issues."
good,"On a typical day away work once I get to my assigned forklift, I have to do an inspection of the lift and check everything off that's ok and not ok with the lift. I proceed to my dock where I unload and load trailers, roughly 14-15 per 8hr shift. The trailers come in every 30 mins and I'm also releasing a trailer every 30 mins. Every trailer that I receive or release have to be documented as well"
good,I really can’t say to much about this review. Can be a great place to work at. Although we are on strike we are trying to receive better benefits for our future
good,Having 1+ years of experience in SAP mm as a consultant and my roles and responsibilities are to resolve thee Lower level and L1 level tickets and customizing the Material Master e.t.c by the Requirements
good,"This environment is very political and they do not hire based on best talent, but based on who knows who.  Very difficult place for high achievers.  For most organizations, they are not focused on people.  I've learned a lot about working  with cross functional stakeholders and different functions.  Though I feel very marketable to other companies, I'm finding it hard to have them meet my compensation requests."
good,Wouldn't recommend to anyone I cared about. Long hours.  Always wondering when the next headcount reduction will be.  Benefits continually getting reduced.
good,"The work environment is stressful but the majority of the employees are nice to work with.  "
good,"I was at GM during the bankruptcy period.  The environment was significantly different than it was before and after.  My ratings reflects those experiences.  Finance was an extremely political organization.  Opportunities were given to a newly designed program, plan for advancement for non program employees was lacking.  Lots of talented people were skipped over for new program participants.  Workplace was constantly in fear of layoffs, especially older employees."
good,Great potential with product / work-life balance.  Poor with advancement / fairness / politics. If you don't fit a certain profile your career will be stifled / thumbed down / type cast.
good,"Es una empresa buena para laborar, tiene buen salario."
good,"Entrenar a nuevos empleados y trabajar como un equipo para cumplir con las citas mientras ensamblamos herramientas, productos, sobres y cajas. Aquí es donde aprendí a establecer una buena relación con mis colegas mientras entrenaba."
good,Trabajadores importante para la gestión del trabajo
good,"Management is partial to employees who only do what they say. Enough projects are not kept in place to keep the employees engaged. More than the actual work , how much you impress your manager is looked for."
good,"If you are looking to go to the Audit Department, find somewhere else to go. GM itself is a good company to work for. I learned a ton and had endless opportunities to learn. The Audit Department, however, is a mess. No one knows what they're doing and they will stab you in the back to cover that up. Management completely sucks, HR wont help you. Honestly, it was the worst working 2 years of my life."
good,"Being a Contractor at GM is good, but I would much rather have the opportunity to once have met my 120 days to have the opportunity to become a full time employee"
good,Gm is a great paying job with great benefits but the amount of time you work and how often would much better suit a single person or someone with grown children
good,Management only wants numbers. The product suffers. The harder hourly personnel work to get the job done correctly the more push back from management.
good,Engineering group is excellent to work with.  There are enough online courses available for one to learn about most job requirements and prepare for your next job
good,"This company is filled with politics and the good old boys network still. claims to have advanced with females and minorities, but is only filling positions based on quotas or needs not actual skills. Full of processes and meetings that bog down the design process. Very inefficient. tends to take the peanut butter approach and punish everyone for the misdeeds of a few, no personal accountability. Middle management is wishy washy and does not have the guts to tell the top brass the truth, then they will punish the workers when they refuse to elevate true issues."
good,"We have corporate values and beliefs in our corporate vision, but due to plant politics, they only apply to a certain group of people.  The leadership culture is very autocratic in nature despite promoting team building and team involvement.  It seems that good managers are ground down to manage the GM way-which is to not truly glean input from team members, but for management to make the majority of the decisions autocratically.  Not all managers are like this, but the overwhelmingly vast majority are at least in my facility."
good,"Newcomers get no benefits when they retire from GM."
good,"I enjoyed going to work each day for General Motors for the time I worked for them as both Contracted and Employed.  I was let go due to restructuring, removing majority of IT personnel.  Until I was let go, I felt that I had a great job with them, enjoyed the environment, and appreciated how they were concerned for employee safety at home as well as at work.  If offered a position from them I would take it."
good,"Fine place to work until 2019 restructuring suddenly let go of many fine salaried employees (around 4,000 of them, including this one).  Some managers are good, but there seems to be little if any corporate effort to review/improve the poor and/or bad managers."
good,"The pay is decent. I wish we we're hired now. We've been temps going on 4 years. I wish we got paid for vacations and sick days.  Also, we work just as hard as the people hired and have seniority, We should get at least a part or piece of the bonus pays they get twice a year. We also need vision coverage. On some jobs I need my glasses but because I don't have any coverage I am unable to get prescription safety glasses which is part of our PPE. For the most i wish GM had a stronger UNION. The best part for the workers is when something breaks down and we have to wait hours for them to fix it, The hardest part can be dealing with people who refuse to grow up and the repetitiveness of the job. Management, I try to say out of their way because as long as you are a temp, they don't hear you. So just do your job and keep the peace."
good,"GM is like any big company, but the constant cycle of internal job transfers and turnover has caused all the people you interact with in a day to have about 20-30% of the needed knowledge to get the task done effectively.  Everyone has arbitrary metrics of 'get this out of your inbox' but little training on the best way to do that or even what constitutes a good job.  The people themselves are well-meaning individuals, but the lack of change in the innumerable disconnected systems that are forced to interact causes a need for the staggering amount of people to do the fairly simple jobs.  On top of that they are adopting only the most annoying of new, hip workplace designs that do not lend themselves to the type of work needing to be done there.  If you have seen Terry Gilliam's Brazil: this is it, but the documents are now e-mails.  If you manage to find something you care about changing you can, through enormous effort, convince enough people to make that change and improve the company as a whole.  Do not, however, expect that to be reflected in any performance reviews since innovation withing your job role is not a metric used to determine performance."
good,"GM Supplier Quality is a large organization which works to support launches of it vehicles by working with suppliers to insure that PPAP, Run at Rate and quality metrics are met and maintained.  The position entails a lot of ""babysitting"" suppliers and does not allow enough SQ involvement during the sourcing procedure.   Suppliers are generally picked based on cost quotations without regard to the amount of time and effort that the SQ must spend to make supplier meet deadlines and metrics.   Supplier Quality Engineers performance metrics are tied directly to performance of their suppliers."
good,Good work life balance.  Culture under constant change and employees have fear of job security.  Support team environment with and offers opportunities to work within various functions to to develop your skills.
good,GM is restructuring and do not have information on the new organization. I cannot provide additional information on the company nor its strategic focus.
good,"After being a GM Loyal Customer for nearly 18 years. Coming from a family thats supported GM Cars for over 50 years. I was excited to finally be working what I considered a Dream Job at GM Proving Grounds. Only to be walked out after 3 years due to involuntary cuts. I watched engineers who don't care about the brand, don't care about GM and just care that they are getting paid. They drive high performance cars and trucks the wrong way on test tracks. Cant read a street sign but are engineering GM's finest. They don't care about you as a person. I turned out to be a number in a pool. Engineer 34y/o no kids."
good,"My co-workers that were part of IT Onsite / IT Live were a great team.   We were one big family.  They were dedicated, smart, and a fun group to work with."
good,"Coworkers and manager were helpful and friendly. "
good,"There is no work/life balance at General Motors, especially as a DRE.  You have your cell phone on your person at all times.  Compensation was very good at General Motors but they expected you to make sure you were available at any time when they call nights/weekends, etc."
good,"The job was working in a factory building trucks and suv's.  The management didn't really try to adjust the person to the job, everyone was put on a job that no one really wanted.  They didn't care if you got hurt on the job."
good,GM is Focusing on electric and autonomous vehicles to be more ecologically sound and take a leadership position in the next generation of transportation.
good,Doing this time when u get hired at GM u r a temp and u get paid good but they work u to much and have to many rules for u r they don't work u at all and u have to find another job
good,"Good pay for the job requirements and decent benefits for the area.  Hard to find another employer on the east side of Ohio that provides these types of compensation and benefits packages.  Work/life balance could be a little better, but, it is a manufacturing facility and therefore requires the need for shift work and overtime."
good,"When you work for GM, it is temporary.  There is no such thing as hired on work.  You will be a temp for a minimum of 18mo.  At that time there is a strict 90 day policy.  You cannot miss any days or you will be terminated!"
good,Not a bad place to work for. Not a lot of downtime or breaks due to meetings. Compensation is decent. Definitely learned some things and they have a pretty good process
good,"Overall, I like GM as a company, but the IT organization is a mess. There is constant tension between IT and the rest of the business, and way too much politics involved throughout management."
good,"Management was very mixed; encountered both very good and very bad supervisors. Local Union is protective of workers with seniority, but new/ temporary hires don't see much benefit from the Union membership. Poor benefits for low-seniority hires due to high-deductible health insurance and no paid time off, though benefits increase in quality drastically once you're hired permanent (NOT guaranteed after a probationary period), which can take a long time. The work itself is very easy-going, though fast-paced, and allows for socialization between coworkers while working next to each other. Few health issues present that are commonly associated with production environments, such as carpel tunnel syndrome, etc. due to ergonomics of the work."
good,"Management promotes a safe workplace environment. I enjoyed my coworkers, most of them were highly intelligent. They cared about providing the customers with a safe product."
good,"Na General Motors fui Coordenador na área de manufatura e logística com 10 anos de experiência na área no qual pude desenvolver minha vasta experiência em liderar, possui uma cultura amigável e um clima amistoso, é bastante focada na satisfação de seus funcionários e busca oferecer alternativas que melhorem a qualidade de vida dos empregados."
good,It is not a place for young people to work it is recommended if you're only trying to do it for short term but as far as long term goals it is better to be looking for something this more sustainable for a career General Motors is a trap to have you there until you die pretty much it has really good compensation in love the bonuses every year but It is not worth the wear and tear on your body nor the long hours
good,General Motors had an amazing IT work force. there are many things that I learned working for them. the work culture is a very collaborative environment. they hardest part of my job was the work life balance. In my area there were many times where I had to drop out of personal activities to get some work done. the best part of the job were the people that I worked with. GM IT is a very diverse work environment so you can enjoy learning from many view points.
good,"GM has a great initiative for helping students by giving them part time, full time or summer jobs. Not the most exciting job, but with the help of fun employees it makes for a fun place to work"
good,"General Motors is your typical corporate america job. Can be slow paced on some days, and stressful on others. There is little room to grow, both horizontally and vertically. The atmosphere is alright, not the best culture but not the worst."
good,"General Motors is what is expected in the auto industry.  Constant changing of personnel, transient management, and the need to reduce costs daily. Stressful, fast paced environment,"
good,"8 hours a day.i learned selling auto parts retail and whole sale,warranty system,monitoring stocks for sales,parts ordering,Job cards system at parts and service department,Service parts estimator,parts warehouse system,managing the department and more.customer relations,i learned the whole system parts and service,workplace culture ok,the hardest part of the job some parts not available cause of customer complaint,the most enjoyable part of the job is marketing."
good,"Highly repetitious work, very fast-paced. Most of my co-workers are enjoyable to be around. The idea of standardized work; that every employee must do their job exactly the same as described in the written instructions for that particular station, can be tedious at times because the instructions are based on a computerized timetable and not realistic working times. Safety is a key issue and enforced. All in all a good company to work for, but market fluctuation causes either a lot of overtime or lay-offs."
good,The pay and benefits are the best thing about the job. Very stressful and at times unorganized. I don't feel like they truly care about there employees.
good,"Jobs were easy to learn when taught how to do them. Upper Management was not friendly or sociable. Good rotation of jobs, never doing the same thing all day."
good,This is a position in a contractual environment which requires a lot of consistent problem solving. The challenge provides excitement throughout the shift.
good,Union lacks enough power to effectively make many job aspects better. To much uncertainty when it comes to job security and management made decisions.
good,"Need more detailed preparation o f new employees to avoid fraternity atmosphere. Detail of job descriptions and procedures sometimes lacking, especially for new hires and colllege grad recruits."
good,"As the domestic market business is closed down lot of rumors flow in and out of company of GM closing its operations in India."
good,A typical days work includes working at a fast pace to meet production numbers. Being a fast learner is key for a job such as this. I've learn to do excellent on each vehicle which has helped increase perfection on the production line. Management is great and the culture of the workplace couldn't be any better.
good,"GM IT has proven a great place to develop IT skills, if you are self motivated.  The Austin office is quite large and relatively new.  As such, there are many brown-field projects that have limited familiarity."
good,"GM was good at times, and bad at others, but I lived through the years when GM included EDS and Delphi.  Then they split off EDS and later Delphi while going bankrupt somewhere in that timeline."
good,"Una empresa que dependiendo del jefe de equipo los días son tranquilos o movidos, por lo general son mantenimientos preventivos y rotalín, Se aprende a manejar muy bien el rotalín, a saber solucionar un problema de arrugas o si raja una pieza en prensa. Lo más dificil es enfrentarte a un problema que no había salido antes."
good,Good place to work. Pay is good and benefits after your 90 days. You get 40 plus hours and get paid every week. Co workers are nice and fun to work with. Overall it's just takes too long to get hired permanent to get all the benefits they offer
good,It's a good company for full-time employees.  They have great benefits and the people are great.  Work is constant and can be different each day.  Good place to work overall.
good,"Was in a large hiring pool to get production up and then laid off less than 6 months later. The work environment was satisfactory, jobs were easy to grasp and training was mediocre at best."
good,"GM can be a great place to work, depending on your leader. Provides opportunity for growth and development, friendly people and good comradery, depending on the group you are in. Can also be demanding and challenging."
good,"Local management with 3 ISPs assigned."
good,Una empresa activa y muy agradable en el ambito laboral
good,"Manufacturing jobs pay less and demand more of you in terms of your personal time. The work is challenging because you are required to produce irrespective of all the odds(Political Climate,Natural Conditions,Supplier Ecosystem)."
good,"My time at General motors has been filled with job replacements, contract negotiations, breaks being taken away, and an ever changing schedule. Every Saturday for 3 years has been required and shifts have been changing. However if you are looking for a good paying job with benefits, not much more can be asked from General Motors."
good,"A typical day at work would be to get there fifteen minutes before your shift starts to set your station up, and put on your protective gear.  Check to see if everything you need is available and working.  It was mandatory to do quality control checks, and to relieve your co-worker who worked the previous shift."
good,The work culture can be good or it can be bad. I worked in two GM plants and had several different job assignments from Toolmaker to Dimensional Manager
good,"There are a lot of friendly people at GM and one's experience can vary widely depending on the group one find themselves in. In my experience, there are a high degree of inexperienced project management. Don't expect any freebies."
good,"General Motors is an excellent company to work for. If you're a full time employee, you can work a stready 40 hours a week. The bathrooms are normally clean and there is access to a changeroom with showers in the basement which is a life saver. "
good,"For the most part, as long as you do you job you will do well. I work for Ryder who is a contractor for GM. It is a lot of hours and can be very stressful from time to time. I have learned a lot in my current role. This job is not for everyone and takes time to learn the job and you will always have room to grow. In the end the experience is what you make it. Its a lot of work and a lot of time but the experience will teach to a lot as well."
good,"Well, GM was very good in terms of salary package and benefits. Very challenging place with long working hours, no work-life balance at all. "
good,"Many intensely busy projects, felt overwhelming and challenging to accomplish tasks given by multiple departments. While leadership was great to work for I often felt overburdened and my stress levels have intensified since I first started."
good,Very fast paced and repetitive. I've learned the importance leadership and teamwork while working for this company. The hardest part was the long hours that had to occasionally be worked and the best part was the different people that you've met on a day to basis.
good,"great brand to work with that provides global exposure to best marketing practices, great workplace but management lacks a proper strategy to move establish their footprints in the country"
good,"Pros:"
good,"Empresa remunera bem, dá chance de aprendizagem, possui tecnologia de ponta que para quem é da automação é ótimo, a segurança é levada a sério, possui um bom ambiente entre funcionários,no entanto, com atual crise a pressão de não poder errar, de perder o emprego fala mais alto. Possui bons valores de PLR , mas demais benefícios possuem um bom desconto, consulta médica com especialista por exemplo é em torno de R$ 46,00 e o pior é o desconto para funcionário na compra de carro próximo de R$1000,00"
good,the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help customers. Proving great customer service and communication skills is a must
good,Proporciona crescimento pessoal e profissional para quem consegue se manter no emprego por pelo menos 3 anos
good,Their is a lack of communication from management and from the Union.  The rumor mill is more accurate then both.  They will only tell you what you want to hear instead of telling you the truth.  If their is bad news they will deny it.
good,"Uma excelente empresa, devido ao cenário atual no segmento do mesmo, mudou se muita coisa."
good,"A empresa possui ótimos processos, no entanto, creio que não esteja em seu DNA o desenvolvimento de pessoas. Ótimo lugar para trabalhar no começo de carreira."
good,"My Functions on daily basis were consisting of a routine of painted vehicle body checks looking for application issues ie: paint runs, bare areas (lack of paint), orange peel (texture), equipment failures effecting quality of the product. Automated robot enclosure inspections/observations looking for application abnormalities or failures to the process. "
good,"This is a good place to work. The company has focus on good work ethics, equal opportunity, work life balance, security and fun. Open leadership and best talent in India."
good,"Very much proffesional culture and system oriented company."
good,Empresa muito boa de se trabalhar so plano de carreira da empresa que deixa a desejar ....
good,"A empresa tem como cultura prezar pelas boas relações entre colaboradores, guardadas as devidas proporções,as pessoas podem expressar-se sem ser repreendido. "
good,"Everyday work was fast pace and being about to stand on your feet for 8-11 hours."
good,"Ambiente competitivo, mas amigável. A empresa conta com pessoas tecnicamente preparadas. Há boa sinergia de trabalho entre as equipes."
good,"I like adventurous events, something new everyday. I would like for my routine to be switched up every once in a while. I love my co-workers, they were all great people.. that's what keeps my day going."
good,It's Ok to work here. Innovative ideas ut hourly workers are more efficient then the engineers at times.
good,Inspection of all 5.0 Manifolds prior to shipping to Ford Motor Company.
good,"Empresa com ótima atuação no mercado, bom tratamento interpessoal entre os colegas de trabalho e liderança. "
good,Global company which promotes healthy competition and strives for success.
good,"Managing suppliers"
good,"Cada dia sempre um dia de desafios,pois trabalhávamos atendendo linha de produção e sempre com horários,jamais poderia haver atrasos e nem paradas de linha. Aprendi trabalho sincronizado,padronizado,em equipe,aprendi também operar ponte rolante,manusear todos equipamentos necessários para montagem de um carro,aprendi hirearquia pelo meus chefes,aprendi normas de segurança e que nenhum serviço é tão importante que não se possa ser feito com segurança.Nosso contato com gerentes era pouco,mas o contato mais direto era com coordenador,nunca tive problemas com eles pois eram pessoas que sempre estavam dispostas a nos ajudar quando necessário e nos davam total liberdade para trabalharmos e expor nossas idéias, mas eram pessoas bem sérias e comprometidas.Quanto aos colegas,pessoas bem profissionais e comprometidas com a empresa, não tenho nenhuma reclamação de ninguém. Parte difícil que trabalhávamos atendendo a linha e era bem corrido. Parte agradável que tínhamos todas condições para trabalho,na questão EPI,Segurança, Máquinas Industriais sempre revisadas e a remuneração que era muito boa."
good,je me suis bien plu a travailler dans cette entreprise j'y ai effectué plusieurs postes
good,"Começamos o dia atendendo a necessidade da produção."
good,"It is difficult to describe GM from a technology perspective, since up until this year, they did not really have an IT division in their portfolio.  However, I have been working for GM for the last 15 years in IT indirectly (through EDS, and HP), and now directly."
good,"I was headhunted for this job, GM is trying to get back into the leasing side of the car business. Due to changes in the senior management structure and territories, I am no longer part of this organization. "
good,"empresa boa que trabalhei longos anos,nunca haviam me decepcionado.mas de uma hora pra outra e sem motivos demitiram muitos funcionários,nos deixando assim surpresos e muito infelizes com as demissões em massa.depois disso eu descobri uma verdadeira general motors,a que nos abandonou quando mas precisávamos e sem motivos concretos..pois sempre me dediquei muito,jamais colaborando para a demissão."
good,Going to work was the most pleasing to me because of the jobs we worked on.
good,this company is very nice and company Experience
good,Criacao de muitas ideias novas que acabam nao tornando realidade pela burocracia interna e processos.
good,"Não foi das melhores nas quais trabalhei, pois havia uma diferença muito grande entre as regiões onde ela se concentra."
good,gm showed me about production building a quality product what it meant to be proud that what you were building was going to be seen and used by an other person so you wanted it to be safe for them as you would for your self
good,i made a good living there for a long time. The pay was great and the benefits good. The culture and management need improving.
good,"I didn't mind working at GM at all, worked there for 18 years! It is not fulfilling but you do not take your work home. You work your 8 hours and then forget about it until your next shift. They definitely treat you like a number though. Because it is unionized, there's no point in trying your best. You won't be rewarded for it. Everything is seniority based."
good,"The Job is demanding, but compensation provides a means to take care of your family The Union could provide better support and the company needs  better mental health support."
good,"beautiful work experience with opportunities to grow.a typical work day, starting at 7am till 3:20pm. The hardest part of the day is just after lunch hour when everyone is exhausted, as this is a production line and everyone is on their feet."
good,"Generous PTO and Holidays, competitive pay. Average benefits, generally reasonable and fair management. Corporate culture is fairly conservative, not much in the way of extras or perks."
good,"Repetitive work on your feet all day and fast paced quick decision making. Learned a lot about lean manufacturing and global manufacturing and communication skills. Also learned how to be a team player and a Leader. The workplace culture was fun but strenuous. Management was ok for the most part they worked with us. The hardest part of the job was the repetitive work, While the most enjoyable was the people we worked with."
good,"Not much opportunity for growth, long hours. Depending on who your manager is, you can drive your career or have them tell you what they think you should do. Overall good company to work for, but no work life balance especially at plants where margins are high."
good,The company is a meeting driven company. I spent half to 90% of my day in meetings. I had a great team and work hours were flexible as long as you get your work done. Management was very open to meeting with me during the Summer and the C-level employees made themselves visible and available. There were also opportunities to take part in trainings that were offered.
good,"General Motors is a decent place work, but some of the full time employees give you a really hard time when your classification is a temp, its a little disheartening to work with people who feel that way."
good,"Cybersecurity policies seem to be updated daily. You find yourself having to navigate through hoops to get a task done. "
good,Great place to work for the benefits. I don't like how management communicates sometimes. Management seems to think that using a disciplinarian style of management will motivate people but it has the opposite effect.
good,Its a good place to work but u work six days a week sometime seven if mandatory. Great pay its just a long way to drive it took me 45 mins there and back each day.
good,"GM gives great opportunities to it's employees, and despite recent layoffs, I would say that the job security is good, if you work hard.  The company suffers from typical large corporation weaknesses, like poor communication from workers to decision-makers, and power-hungry executives."
good,A numbers driven company who coaches team effort but does not support from the top down. They have a number of supervision levels.  Team leaders is at the bottom and is rarely supported they way the company envisions them to be supported.  Benefits and pay are great for a reason.
good,"Overworked, stressed, false sense of support but GREAT PAY over time.  That's General Motors.  Management is a joke, sexual harassment is at a all time high and the union  works with* management.  Dont kick up any dust, dont make friends, and be PERFECT at your job (no mistakes) and you'll do fine here."
good,"I liked my job at General Motors. I worked there for 18 years. Then they decided to put our plant in idle until contract time in September,  they forced people to move all over the United States to keep their jobs. The jobs we did were very fast paced and we had to keep up with the line.  My last job there was to put over 400 batteries in a day. I got along well with management and other team players."
good,"I am retiring from General Motors and am seeking part time and/or flexible employment to help fill my days and to use my education and skills. I come from a professional background and started working at General Motors as a ""transition"" job.  I ended up loving the benefits so I stayed until I was eligible to retire."
good,Typical assembly line atmosphere. Not a place for anyone with skills or creativity. Company does not value its employees. Cannot allow them to now future plans loves to provide false information. Stressful.
good,"Very focused on youth, diversity, and autonomous vehicles."
good,"GM is not a bad place to work. But the company will lay off at any time for no reason. They have great pay and benefits, my co-workers are very friendly."
good,Too may decision's are coming out of committees.  This makes for too many average results and expensive operating costs.  Would like to see meeting's a bit more controlled by size and frequency.
good,GM stresses the importance of balancing work and personal like outside of work. Employees are encouraged to work from home as see fit and team events are planned each quarter.
good,"Your experience at General Motors depends a lot on your manager. Some managers do care about their reports and serve as good mentors to grow them, while some managers don't really care as much. If you happen to work for a manager in the first category, General Motors will offer a very rewarding career as there are lots of opportunities to grow and learn. However, if you have the latter, your experience will not be as rewarding."
good,During my time with GM I have been presented with great opportunities and gain knowledge in areas to better my experiences in IT. I enjoy the colleges willingness to help and assist on troubled projects. All of my leadership has been open and honest with me on projects and allowed me to lead my projects without micro-managing.  Workplace was great for most of the time until recent as moral hasn't been the same for the past few months.
good,"I have ten years production experience, with five of that being management. In that time I managed seven different lines, ranging from thirty to eighty five Team members. Everyday duties, including but not limited to. GMS/Lean manufacturing, payroll- GMTKS & KRONOS Systems, safety, quality, throughput, daily manpower and vacation approvals and scheduling. I was the problem solving lead, and trainer of 3rd shift and then 2nd shift when 3rd shift was reduced out."
good,GM offers good Health Care Benefits and 401K package. Tuition fees reimbursement  goes up to 8000 a year. For the new college hire program you get a raise every 6 months for the first 3 years.
good,"Poor corporate management decisions decade after decade always lead to massive job cuts. Executive leadership and marketing are never held accountable for poor decision making, i.e. the products the decide to produce and cannot sell."
good,Buen lugar para trabajar se adapta en sus horarios para cada persona tmb
good,"Good Opportunities within, Good Benefits and Pay (Health Savings Account; Affordable Health Insurance).  Otherwise, not all that much unlike other large companies.  GM is moving in the right direction.  Arguably the most forward thinking of the big 3."
good,"Lots of time dealing with union issues. Lots of good people to work with , also some challenging ones too. The most enjoyable part of the job was retiring."
good,I was a supervisor at a parts distribution facility. I completed all aspects of supervising in tandem with other supervisors of approximately 250 employees per shift.
good,General Motors is a great company. The IT function is working to implement an effective in-sourced model. General Motors as a company is promoting all the right values to employees to enable a one team culture.
good,"-Un día típico era bastante monto, dando apoyo a el área de marketing si lo requerían."
good,"General Motors IT is a good top fortune organization to gain experience at. The enterprise systems, tools, infrastructure and processes provide a good learning environment."
good,"Muy buena sólo que no saben como resolver conflictos de índole competitivo y la distribución de las responsabilidades no son controladas ,unos cobran por líderes de equipo son otros los que realmente hacen que funcione como un equipo  í si te quejas te tildan como rebelde  generan discordia entre compañeros para sacar mayor provecho de situaciones creando ellos un  clima de trabajo  muy denso"
good,Working at General Motors is a good opportunity to develop relationships with good people. The day starts off with knowing your working for a good company. Learning the ways of the company. The working in a diverse environment.
good,"Eu era Prestadora de Serviços, não tinha um contato grande internamente na empresa, aprendi muito na área trabalhista, foi uma experiência maravilhosa e levarei para o meu caminho profissional."
good,"The work day starts with a preshift huddle up and then after that you go to your station and start your work. You don't learn much accept on how to package the parts and read the paperwork. Its not a hard job but there is nothing glamorous about it either. For the most part, you go in, do your job and you really have no issues. Anyone could work there. Day in and day out is pretty much the same thing. Always the same daily routine."
good,General Motors was a good company that had good values and that followed their vision statement. The working environment was great and they always put safety first.
good,The biggest perk of working at Williams Hunt at least based my personal experience is a feeling that your work really matters and has an impact on the world.
good,"A gerência, de maneira geral, da liberdade e incentiva o trabalho dos funcionários."
good,"Long hours, lots of dead ends. I spent a lot of time at work daily (14-16 hours) on days that we’re only supposed to be 8 hours. There is little compensation for over time and there aren’t many opportunities for advancement without a ton of politics."
good,You are given what you need to be successful.  Good Communication from Leadership.    Process is clearly defined.  Work/Life Balance is completely secured.
good,"GM is a great company for work life balance and advancement opportunities.  There are many good people and good managers who work there.  If you end up on a bad team, it's not good and can be a significant challenge.  It is a huge organization so you need to be ok with being a small fish in a huge pond."
good,Can be stressful at times when depending on others for your materials or assistance. Morale is medium as employees are not happy working six days each week. Management taking advantage of the fact that the local union has not agreed to a contract for over two years.
good,As a credit Analyst at General Motors Financial you are in a face pace work environment working with dealerships. The culture is very laid back and I work with a lot of great people.
good,It was a long time ago.  I remember having paid vacations and the pay was decent for the time. Nowadays it wouldn't fly. Regardless they've closed down
good,Interesting work comparing information from different systems. Overall good atmosphere. Sometimes lack of clear direction was an obstacle. Huge place.
good,"Typical work day is to assist members with the connectivity of their hardware in their vehicle.  I have learned new technology tools.  Management is okay, but the ones that are under management that are with the floor crew everyday are excellent.  The culture is be yourself and make sure the member is taken care of in the best way possible.  The hardest part of the job was learning  how to apply the material that I learned to better assist the member.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the discounts that we get for working for them."
good,"Good money very hard work went through a lot of surgerys to repair myself from working so hard, great friends made along the way and also a lot of attitudes along the way"
good,"Working at General Motors has been relatively tranquil. There is a high amount of stress on product release, but not much repercussion for missed deadlines."
good,I would begin my day with a team meeting. I would receive a schedule to know what had to be built and shipped.  I was responsible to over see change over of equipment and advise the operators what the required build was for the entire shift.
good,"Ambiente di lavoro buono, con qualche problematica di gestione lavorativa dai supervisor non all'altezza nelle sale prove motori, il salario e ottimo compresi gli aumenti al raggiungimento degli obiettivi."
good,"Everyone's pretty nice, management helps when needed and there's a lot of diversity there also. I only wish i could change the benefits we get and my jobs security a little more. Working here i've learned team work and a lot of problem solving."
good,"Several interesting projects to work on a company of this size. High caliber professionals in the finance team. Internal politics can be a little much."
good,"Calls of co-workers"
good,General Mortors uma empresa na qual tive um bom momento na qual tive varias experiência
good,"Great benefits, but little room for advancement. Due to working in an IT area that was recently insourced, which prior to was consultants, there is a lack of willingness to work as a team or share information with others to accomplish tasks. Very little documentation of processes occur due to the want to hold on to information for possible job safety. Not the best place, but definitely not the worst. Good work life balance, as working remotely from time to time is available."
good,"I was responsible for small to large turnkey project within the company."
good,"The compensation and benefits are very competitive.  The employees are very dedicated to their work and take pride in what they do.  The culture varies by department and you can find some great teams and great leaders.  All in all, the company has a culture that breeds internal competition more than focusing on external competition.  Transparency and honest feedback from Senior leaders is uncommon."
good,"Good companies with many opportunities, but very little innovation and growth opportunities. The business still runs like its the 1990s and the IT is lagging behind."
good,"The organization can become stagnant after a long  stint at levels. It has comparable benefits and good wages. "
good,"Empresa de nome, onde se aprende muito com os colegas, sempre dispostos a ajudar, com muitos gestores competentes que sabem direcionar a equipe para as metas."
good,"Hesitant for change and innovation, poor talent acquisition - smart people may advance or leave the company; a lot of people who are underqualified play politics and make simple things more difficult to accomplish than necessary. Departments work in silos."
good,People are willing to accommodate if approached. There is much to learn if allowed the chance to attend meetings or activites.
good,"Empresa boa de trabalhar,porém as pessoas ficam submissas a um certo tempo sem poder ir ao banheiro."
good,"Muy buena empresa para desarrollarse profesionalmente"
good,Every day was challenging due to the enviroment we were working because we want zero line stoppage at the end of day.I build alot of experience during the years from warehousing up until inventory control.Management was constantly changing because of the company's transformation and we must abide by the adjustments.We work well as a team.Breakpoint changes and explanation for line stoppages was the hardest part of the job.The most enjoyable part was that we hit zero line stoppages for 3 months in a row.
good,Good work and life balance along with a good compensation and benefit package especially for a recent college granduate
good,"High energy environment.  I am fortunate to work with very smart and hard working coworkers.   Another great thing is the unique environment in place that fosters the ability to learn more about the business.  However, I feel that long term vision, strategy, and planning could be better and day to day activities continue to be reactive for business continuity.  There is also sluggish internal movement to adopt new technology and major IT outsourcing has led to poor ability to service the customer."
good,Aprendi muito na empresa e na área metalurgica. Na fabricação de automóveis e como lidar no chão de fábrica.
good,"Not a bad place to work. Great co-workers and a lot of younger people being hired in. "
good,The typical work day was usually busy and included different tasks daily.  I enjoyed working alongside my supervisor as a team leader and learning new more effective ways of meeting safety and production goals.  My co-workers were very hard working people.  The hardest part of the job was the physical aspects of lifting parts sometimes up to 45 to 50 lbs.  The most enjoyable part of my job was feeling like I worked with my second family to build a quality product we could all be proud of at the end of the day.
good,Empresa sólida e responsável que zela por produtos de qualidade e satisfação do seu cliente.
good,"Aprendi bastante na empresa ao longo dosanos, me desenvolvi profissionalmente,passei por diversas áreas, tem um ótimo ambiente de trabalho, a gerência creio que está meio perdida devido a implementação da nova forma de avaliação imposta pelo comitê executivo, a meritocracia. É uma empresa séria, mas ainda existe falhas no que ela quer combater, o paternalismo."
good,"The IT Departments are new In  GM, so there is still a lot of room for improvement. Opportunities for advancement are scarce."
good,"Grande empresa para se trabalhar, excelente área de para aprendizado, com maquina novas e grande estrutura para realização de serviços, porém muito burocrática, com falta de organização em muitas áreas deixando muitas perderem seu comprometimento com o serviço."
good,"- Ambiente laboral bueno."
good,"Uma empresa no geral boa de trabalhar, aprendi muitas coisas como          menor tempo de execução, desperdício em atividades, e companheirismo. Unica coisa e que a economia é muito instável e as vendas de carros não esta indo bem e o empregos de todos estavam em risco, pois decidi fazer um acordo e sair."
good,work closely with team members to review business requirements and establish test approach.
good,ótima empresa. Empresa investe em curso de atualizacao de equipamentos.
good,Empresa que apenas Influenciava e conduzia pessoas para alcançar objetivos profissionais e sociais.
good,"Otima,nao tenho nada a reclamar otimao restaurante, assistencia medica otima"
good,Verify employees are present and clocked in.  Place manpower to fill open jobs.  Daily meetings with team leaders to review previous day performance.  Set-up a plan to make necessary corrections.  Communication issues found to other supervisor for them to put a plan in place to cut off and eliminate issues found.  Monitor downtime and thru-put to meet daily goals.
good,"Audited new contracts for accuracy, processed contracts to active accounts, managed 15-1, 27-1 and 15-20 financial accounts."
good,"Too stressful. A typical day of work is a shift one of 3 types: 6am -2pm, 2pm-10pm, 10 pm- 6am, The most important thing is the people you run across. The job is boring like any other factory job, but there are modern systems to take the 'heavy' responsibility from you, so you could sleep at night :) Everything is being cleared out on an everyday before-work meeting which is very helpful."
good,"Upper Management was very analytical and outgoing.  Great working environment.  Great Benefits and specially tuition reimbursement at the time.  Again, great company."
good,"Overall great learning experience.  Great hours."
good,"Very routine workday in a UAW union environment with an aging, yet highly skilled work force of 21 personnel. I inherited a division that was continuously in labor relations which was a new learning experience."
good,"Maior montadora de automóveis do mundo , tem sua cultura e valores bem especilficado, bom relacionamento entre colegas e lideres ,liderança jovem e dinâmica em relação as mudanças de mercado , com  grande concorrência  com outras montadoras ."
good,"Um bom lugar de trabalho ,"
good,Good place to work. New tools and learning opportunities. Work culture is good. Flexible timings.
good,"Working the assembly line, provided relief for others when needed. worked hard"
good,"lock out/ tag out procedure, learned about dock doors malfunctions, hours were afternoon shift which was new for me, same place every day, 9million sq feet."
good,Well my experience dates back to Feb 2010 was awesome.
good,Hay un ambiente laboral (compañerismo) pero no hay motivacion para los trabajadores de ningun tipo.
good,poor teamwork. cut throat competition at exec. level. Left before bankruptcy - they could not comprehend the drastic changes needed to save themselves
good,a typical day at work involves going through boxes of car parts that are shipped into the united states from china. Every parts has to be checked to make sure that they can use the part on the line at the General Motors plant. Working this job has taught me to take my time and really pay attention to what i am doing because one mistake can cause major problems down in the future. I me new co workers that have became my friends outside of the workplace. The hardest part of the job was all the heavy lifting yet the easiest part was going through the boxes and picking out the bad parts that couldn't be used.
good,Good work in the respectful environment as I supported engine design engineers teams on the materials issues
good,Challenging assignments and excellent environment to learn and grow.
good,good place to work if you can geet in. fast pace work.get breaks
good,"Management not supportive of advancement."
good,"Productive and fun place to work .Fast paced manufacturing facility with high demands/expectations  on productivity/throughput."
good,Good experience and intro into the Automotive industry. Pay is fair but a lot of hours and overtime. Enjoyed working with the engineering team and management. Can be stressful when working on the Assembly line.
good,Auto production.  Making Chevrolet small cars. Most of the coworkers are very friendly and helpful. I have learned a lot about building cars. I have learned a lot about what it takes to build a car.
good,"Great pay and benefits, horrible management, weak union, hard to raise children with all the shift changes and relocations, and extremely hard on the body. Not worth it in the long run. My coworkers were the absolute best thing about my job."
good,There is no advancement opportunity for the AZ area. It is great for New Grads to work here but you can only become a Software Manager. There is no possibility to become a Director.
good,I would say General Motors is a good place to work.  I have enjoyed my time there.  That being said there are other places to consider for a job in the auto industry.
good,The company was at times a very progressive and innovative company to work for.  They compensated their emloyees very well and provided outstanding benefits.  Unfortunately they have decided to no longer produce a product in Lordstown Ohio and I do not want to move away from family.
good,was a good place but not so good sometimes as far as driving the opportunities to the employee or even to facilitate lateral moves in the organization
good,"The Good:  This is a great company for a recent college graduate."
good,"No real direction for the company. Management doesn't give great leadership or direction for new hires, feels like a sink or swim environment. You're either a go getter or you're not."
good,"General Motors is so large that the workplace culture varies between departments.If you like always changing organizational relations, this is the company for you. It's one of the best places for university graduates or those early in their careers. It can be a little stagnant for senior staff because these positions are filled and rarely available."
good,"Started at age 18 and retired at age 55 loved every minute of it. Hated to leave, but company relocated to other states. I did want to want to leave this warm climate in Georgia to the snowy states. I started in Flint, Michigan and came to Georgia to move from the snow."
good,"This position requires organization and time management skills that have provided me with improved knowledge coordination of materials and systems management."
good,Great opportunity with a fantastic company. Everyone is very relaxed and laid back. Would like to work here long term but I was hired as a contractor.
good,Watching the various components to assembling a vehicle is the most interesting thing to do. Each element from raw sheet metal to a polished vehicle can be assembled every 59 seconds ready to roll off the line.
good,In the forge plant until you the basics of the operation you were to perform it  could be stressful. I became a quick learner . The managers were promoted from the shop floor and were hard-nosed.
good,"Contractors seem to be second class citizens."
good,Interesting technology where you can learn a great deal. Problems concerning workplace safety in fuel cell lab and people not always willing to cooperate to resolve these issues.
good,"General Motors was a pretty mixed bag. On the one hand, the work/life balance was good, people were generally nice, and there was the opportunity to work on some pretty great projects and systems. On the other hand, processes were sometimes insanely slow, technology was often outdated, and sometimes decisions seemed liked they were the result of internal politics or a CYA mindset rather than a genuine opinion on what was best for the business. Great place to work if you just want to work your 9 - 5 and go home, but you will get tired of it if you're the type of person who wants to push the envelope."
good,"Typically poor communication, lack of advancement, and no culture. The jobs are extremely difficult and there are a lot of forced saturdays. I would not recommend for someone just starting out if they already have a family and need life/work balance."
good,overall it was a good environment working with others management could have been better especially new employees better on the job other than that i had good co-workers
good,I think maybe 40% of people are fulfilled by their work. The benefits and pay make it hard to leave the job even when unsatisfied. The IT offices are more relaxed than the other locations across the US. You will have a great work-life balance. GM rarely places all responsibilities on one person however that often results in not enough work to go around and boredom. The best part about GM is the opportunities you have that only a large company can offer. Also now is a cool time to be part of the automotive industry as it's making its shift to autonomous vehicles.
good,"Good in Work Life Balance and Have flexible work time. Also, the Company Policies are really good. The employees are really vey nice and they will always try to help you- if you have asked for."
good,"The training is good, my trainer was friendly and helpful."
good,"Its a nice company to work, hood environment, employee friendly. "
good,"At the time of the Space Race , grossly overstaffed, bloated bureaocracy...........very low profit oriented"
good,Great people! Very encouraging and will help you along the way with school.Very flexible with school and other job hours. Always willing to help.
good,"Sportactiviteiten met sommige collega's van het fabriek , zoals hardlopen en mountainbiken. Super en lekker plezant"
good,Need more out of my job to use my skills.  Daily work includes nothing but basic knowledge that does not allow me to use my mind and skills attained through school and life.
good,"Jornadas de mucho mas de 8 horas incluyendo domingos y dias festivos."
good,"Work is not diffucult, Job security a real issue, hired in a temp and some temps have been there 2 years or more.. Futher more you pay union dues but the union does not protect you.  Also the union pays out profit sharing bonus, but because you are a temp you do not qualify even though you are paying union dues."
good,"People are great co-workers, supervisor. The most enjoyable part of the job is to talk to customers all over the states when they're in good spirit."
good,"Great folks to work with!  Too bad place closed.  Learning curve for GM.  Honda, Toyota made better cars at that time.  GM was behind the game when it came to Total Manufacturing system.  It is not the technology, it's the people that make the cars! It took management time to figure that out, but it got to late when you lose sales to the other.  Hey I am a consumer too!"
good,A gmb e uma empresa de grande porte com potencial para ensinar e dar formaçao para seus empregados   com uma estrutura  para dinamizar o trabalho dos operadores  facilitando resultados finais.
good,"foi uma otima empresa ,compre com horários e rotas de trabalho focado com passageiros ,seguança no trabalho e responsábilidade"
good,"Good company, good people, long days, kind of borning work but worth the money."
good,As a body fitter it was my job to ensure door and lift gate gaps were in quality specifications for final inspection and then for consumer delivery.
good,I'm glad I had this experience however it's not one I would repeat.  Lifting side panels for truck beds every 12.3 seconds from the assembly line to the stacking cart in 90-110 heat is very demanding on the body.  It did give me a different outlook on what it takes to build a vehicle and I appreciated the stamina it takes to perform the task.  This was a summer temp position.
good,"Fell happy about the job done for the day"
good,Need more hours and a chance to go up. More respect and more time training on the job. More of the bonuses and a chance to exceed if need be. I love gm but there just isn’t room for improvement.
good,"Exciting at first. Lots of people wanted to go into management just for the benefits, creating the current culture of clueless managers (not leaders) who excel at status quo. Buddy-buddy club built empires early creating political popularity show and advancement opportunities quickly dwindled. Recent fad of promoting women even if they are ill suited to the role is another puzzler. Upper management is largely inept and has no vision."
good,I worked in GM for one year and it was in Uzbekistan. Difficult to give a right overview of the company because the job culture mirrored the country and not the company.
good,"GM has lost many good team members over the past 6 months.  There seems to be no possibility of advancing and/or expanding responsibilities. The layoff in February, 2019 has taken a toll on employee morale."
good,"This is a decent place to work if you are a self started and are good at networking and building your personal brand. Otherwise it is easy to get ""lost""."
good,es una empresa que da muchos beneficios como  breeck comida se aprende a trabajar con respeto y educacion te dan cursos obligatorios
good,"Great benefits and good work space."
good,"It was a good job.  It afforded a living, with good benefits.  I t was certainly a good company to work for if you didn't have a degree.  The nature of the work didn't offer me much personal satisfaction,"
good,Good place to learn new things and stay in comfort zone. This place is good in management supporting you on what you want to do but that is about it. Good for beginners and people who don't want to work hard.
good,"Trabalhei a 9 anos, ótimo salário mas não tem estabilidade."
good,"Worked many years for GM.  Primarily on the assembly line.  Left to relocate, otherwise I would have liked to retire with them.  Great benefits, retirement, etc.,"
good,"Dealing with productivity issues within the warehouse operations, together with other logistical problems, eg shipping lines, freight forwarders and other supply issues"
good,"hay buen ambiente de trabajo,te enseñan bien y son accesibles"
good,a typical day is working on an assembly line making automobiles.  My job was not that hard.  However once you learn how to do your job the job becomes very easy.  I learned how to do multiple jobs at this company.
good,"- Been with the company for about 2 1/2 years"
good,"I was for more Educated than my Supervisor and that created problems ,he was jealous and tried to cause problems with me all the time that was stressful and interfered with my job constantly."
good,Good work life balance.Will get time and opportunity to learn new things. Except location of the company thing are all fine. Had to face extreme winter conditions.
good,"No exigen entrar a una hora determinada a los del área administrativa, solo cumplir los proyectos diarios de la compañía."
good,Excellent work culture. More benifits to employees. More to learn. Equal opportunities . Good remuneration.good experience.sad that its gnf away from india.
good,"I have learned a lot, and the culture at work is great. There is a common passion among the company for the products that are being designed. The company offers a lot of competitive benefits and gives the employee plenty of room for advancement. The biggest weakness I have experienced is the ability to train new talent. They are such a large company, it is easy to get lost in the fold."
good,"I loved working for GM the only, being home everyday was big binus for me having come from construction. The biggest downfall is how your paid, Flat rate used to be a fair system but it has become very one sided and favors for the dealership and GM only. There are very few perks to being flat rate anymore as vehicles become more complicated and advanced. Not paying people just because a customer brought a vehicle in and the only problem was a blown fuse is not fair to the tech. It still takes time to bring in a vehicle and look at it but GM does not pay for it nor will the dealer if it's warranty."
good,Large company with a deep and established culture. Plenty of opportunities in the areas of finance and engineering. Slow to accept change from the ground up.
good,Very clicky job culture if management likes you you can do anything you want if they don't you are on their black list even if you did nothing wrong if they don't like they will pick with you. The Union there is not that strong as far as protecting your job they allow management to practically do whatever they want to do to employees. Benefits is great money is great you get good profit sharing and bonuses.
good,"I done a jot of jobs from CDL driving, Fork truck driver, Team leader, Paint inspector, Assembly line worker, Sub assembly builder, Shipping deck worker, Planning team ,and many more.."
good,"Empresa muito boa"
good,"At the beginning of the day I took attendance made sure everything was in order so the day would run smooth. I learned how to weld, drive a fork truck, use an air gun, put strips on a car, operate a press, and manage people and shipping and receiving techniques."
good,"A typical work day started out by being on time to start manufacturing operations, either in a assembly environment or auto parts manufacturing setting."
good,* Always on the go which made the day go quick
good,"el ambiente de trabajo es buno, en cuanto al sueldo ya no se puede apirar mas, las utilidades ya an bajado demasiado, es un trabajo estable pero con poca aspiraacion a acender."
good,"General Motors is a place that you create family. the work place can be stressful but the people that really make it, such an enjoyable place to work in."
good,"Busy but rewarding, most of the time good life and work balance, not when there is a urgent ask that requires immediate attention.    Culture can be better and hopefully getting there."
good,"This was a part picking job fulfilling orders for dealers.  As a union employee, the salary management staff was always demanding more.  As a new hire, I was full time, but paid half the hourly rate of the folks who have been grandfathered before the restructuring deal that bailed GM out.  I felt discouraged that I was being asked to work twice as hard to pick up the slack for folks who were getting paid twice as much."
good,"my first professional experience highlighted the good and bad of corporate world. I learned a lot about analysis and operations. "
good,Learned a lot.  But the pay wasn't the same as if I had worked at GM.  The training was excellent and I was advanced because of my excellent communication skill.
good,"Ambiente agradável, excelentes benefícios é foi maravilhoso para meu crescimento com as experiências adquiridas."
good,Good company to work for. Have a lot of their ducks in a row and are doing great financially. I would recommend someone to work for GM. I'd go back if that poses an opportunity.
good,"It was  a great experience for me to work for such a big company like GM with lots of benefits ,nice environment working with wonderful collegues hard working team."
good,No es posible evaluar la empresa ya que estaba contratada por terceros
good,I was posted out at GMA and I loved my job . I actually looked forward to coming to work every night . My coworkers are great and the company is great
good,"Pagamentos todos em dia, benefícios todos corretos, porem o cargo de aprendiz serve apenas de enfeite, o aprendiz apenas passeia pela dependências da empresa e organiza inventario, sem poder tocar em equipamentos ou exercer oque esta aprendendo no SENAI"
good,I did sub assembling on my job. I made the jackbracket and installed them. I was also drilling holes in the passenger van.  I also did spot welding. I order parts and restocked the inventory.
good,Wish there was more time with family. could calm down on working every saturdays. Wish they were more helpful when it comes to sicl leave like give better instructions or steps on what to do when takinf of for a certain ammount of time.
good,No era una área muy indispensable para mi formación laboral.
good,"Career Building is good.All India experience in sales is nurtured.Middle Level Management is ambitious.Field Experience is promoted.Focus on Training and Development.Being creative, innovative and proactive is appreciated.Encouragement to start something new is given importance."
good,Days where full of completing different tasks for any group that needed assistance.  I worked with many different groups to gain knowledge of how each of the ran. Had to have extreme adaptability every day.
good,"It's an easy job to work at, but the supervisors they have at the Rochester, NY plant are lazy, as well as, the union is completely useless."
good,"Es un lugar agradable para trabajar, al ser una empresa de clase mundial tiene buenos beneficios para sus trabajadores."
good,Gm empresa de grande porte ótima de trabalhar amigavel e leva a serio o diereitos do trabalhador
good,"o dinamismo;"
good,"Excellent workplace, good management, great compensation, great coworkers, the hardest part is when work late and the enjoyable one is when we reach the goals ."
good,"A typical day at work included interactions with GM dealership employees to assist in investigations for product failure claims. I started out as a tier II agent and was promoted to Product assistance claims. I have learned a great deal about the how vehicles work in regards to air bags, seatbelts and how the vehicle is inspected when calims are made that the vehicle caused an accident due to mechanical failure. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the repercussions behind the recalls GM has issued on numerous vehicles. The most enjoyable part about the job is the great friends I have made in some of my co workers and the things I have leaerned that can help me and others when it comes to vehicle safety."
good,"Empresa muito boa de si trabalhar,salario otimo,mas fomos desligados da empresa por faixa salarial,desligaram nos com mais tempo de casa,e contrataram outros pagando metade do salario."

good,"Easy job just required too many hours, and a mandatory hour lunch.The hardest part of the job is receiving a new schedule every week which can be a huge inconvenience if you have children."
good,"Typical day. Painting and pin stripping new cars."
good,"Very traditional work environment. Old factory, not much new technology. Manufacturing floor was dirty and frequently had oil spilled on it. Most days the air quality was also very bad."
good,"On a typical day, I'll clean About houses. From inside to the yard work. Some people think I'm crazy but when you Doing something you love it becomes a passion."

good,"Excelente empresa un día laboral en GM es ser pro-activo muy eficiente y eficaz con respecto a mis colegas totalmente profesionales siempre atentos y y dispuestos a aprender cada día mas, la parte mas complicada ninguna , y lo que mas me gusto en la parte laboral esta empresa de verdad tiene a sus trabajadores muy contentos siempre están innovando y preparando a su personal para ser mejores personal y profesionales"
good,"Very competitive atmosphere."
good,"fue una buena practica profesional aprendí a tomar ordenes, y a trabajar rápido."
good,"Fiquei durante um ano e três meses como consultor de vendas na Auto Imperial em Petrópolis, ambiente de trabalho muito limpo e confortável. Porém, em relação a base financeira não são compatíveis com o cargo e também a gerencia atual e levada como uma brincadeira. O funcionário precisa ser enxergado como um profissional e um colaborador para a empresa, não como um lixo e tratado com palavras de baixos calão nas reuniões diárias. Me desliguei por minha livre e espontânea vontade, mas em si é uma ótima empresa e como todas as outras tem seus lados bons e ruins."
good,Could have offered the temp employees more then wat they did. It was okay place to work only had three unpaid time off no job offers for temp just in and out
good,Great company not much room for advancement if your in the boys club you're more likely to get a foot up. Bosses treat you like robots they want parts out as quickly as possible. Clean room facility not safe to work in health wise cal fluid is very strong smelling.
good,Great place to work and most of the hourly personnel are great people to supervise . The only issue I have is no room for advancement and no recognition for a job well done .
good,you watched people have fun and you yelled all the time. Management wouldnt wor with you to help find someone to take extra shifts but dont schedule enough in the building to do so.
good,Uma empresa multinacional com várias oportunidades de crescimento para quem esta começando.
good,"Como becario te explotan mucho, realmente tu escuela les importa muy muy poco, yo llegué a salir hasta las 6 p.m. cuando mi hora de salida era a las 2 p.m. además que era algo muy común."
good,"Extremely hard, physically demanding work. Benefits and pay great. Some people and most of managment is very hard to work with. Management always pushing to do more than humanly possible."
good,"GM needs to get rid of false managers and directors."
good,GM is a very fast-paced culture.  Getting tasks done that require cooperation from others is a huge issue at GM.  Slow in recognizing and also alleviating roadblocks of success and also slow in response to the customer.
good,"Management isn't great, the work isn't that fun but at the same time if you learn the jobs and get into a rhythm then you're fine.  The money was good and was the most enjoyable part of the job as well as the people who work there."
good,The job was not hard or stressful at all but as a temp you get no vacation time or pto days and they had some people that had been there for almost 5 years as a temp.
good,"If you're a temp for this company, you pretty much stay a temp. You work besides a full time employee to receive non of the benefits that he or she would get and you're more than likely doing more work then they are. It's going on 5 years and yes it's a group of us that are still temporary."
good,"Foi um desafio diferente, onde desenvolvi outras capacidades e conheci outro tipo de clientes."
good,"Sobre um dia de trabalho, era relativo, as vezes era tranquilo, mas outras era pressão total!"
good,This job is very slow paced but great family feeling and coworkers can be super reasonable but management sometimes doesn't understand family and family emergency.
good,"The political aspects of this job are enough to drive you nuts. No matter how hard you work or how dedicated to doing a quality job you may be. You have a cap on your potential ceiling. Feeling as if you’re never really appreciated by management and watching others that make double the pay as you or more while. Doing a third of the work is frustrating. And the constant mandatory hours regardless of rather or not you have a sick child at home or a funeral to attend is unspeakable. I love to work and I like overtime. But as a single father of a child, I only get her weekends. And when they say mandatory Saturday, that basically means your job is more important than your family. I thought Gm was a dream career. Meanwhile I watch as this money hungry corporation lays off and terminates people that thought the same way I did about them. It’s sad really."
good,"You never know day today if you were going to have a job. One minute you're working 12 hour days 7 days a week, the next you're being laid off. If you are low seniority, don't get comfortable with the shift your on. Constantly being bumped to different shifts. Absolutely no balance between home and work life."
good,"Started at GM hoping to go from contract worker to GM employee. In my experience, being hired at GM is all about who you know, not what you know. People also get overlooked for promotions because of this."
good,"Day was good."
good,"1) Global GM leadership thinks that the GM culture will be same throughout the GM plant across globe.  But if you look into the Talegaon plant , the management and the leadership peoples developed the bad work environment worst than indian companies."
good,"Empresa da todo apoio para o trabalhador exercer sua função da melhor maneira, cursos , treinamentos e motivação, otimos equipamentos e visao empresarial."
good,"Very interesting to see the new vehicles modeled."
good,"A empresa como um todo tem mais prós do que contras, mas algumas promoções equivocadas da empresa ou seja pessoas sem qualificações para a função colocando todo esforço de uma equipe para alcançar a visão da empresa, outro fator fator negativo é a hipocrisia usada por maus gestores. Oferece bons benefício mas cobra um pouco caro por eles, e atualmente ocorre muita desvalorização dos funcionários causando uma desmotivação geral e muitos desligamentos."
good,"Various design and manufacturing review meetings daily. Report presentations on non-conformance for top imperatives including packaging, mass, piece cost, tooling investment, mass, performance, etc."
good,At this company they give you the freedom to do your job without micro-managment.
good,"The place in straight forward and after a dollar, but clean. The way in is hard and the flex/ Part-time aspect of the hiring process is not great it causes issues with getting in to be hiried"
good,When i hired in gm was great over the years people buying foreign cars  weakened  them now they are a shell of the great company they were  a lot of people depend on them i hope they  survive
good,Only worked for two weeks And I can’t understand other people that work there some of them are from a different country.But the job pays well also they didn’t really get into any details about benefits
good,"fast paced day, always moving, you have to pay attention to detail, and always stay alert. safety is there #1 concern. the shift changes are always there, so the job can work for anyones schedules."
good,"Too many meetings."
good,"Over the years, GM has been very good to me.  I have learned more that can be communicated in 150 words.  Life's lessons, and work schedule vs family life were a challenge, while being on the road most of my career.  Great learning experience."
good,"Holidays, nights, weekends, rotating shift monthly.   Good pay, however very fast paced environment. Benefits are mediocre. Management plays favorites and not a great office in Sugarland for women management."
good,"There is good and bad, just like any company out there. Dealing with the union is always a feat of its own, which making changes or improvements is always a fight. Time management is not strong or accountability, and the plant is more stressful. Plant life there is a tight time frame to fix an issue, but the engineers take as long as can be to make the changes."
good,GM provided an education and a very decent living. A group move made continuing to work in the die engineering group impossible. I am grateful for the experience.
good,The review from the material type person couldn't be farther from the truth.  Build 26 was a bad place to work.  All management cares about the pie charts and the junk  boards that are a mandatory waist of time.  They still load and unload full body behind building 26 with no dock.  Just lift it to trailor hight put it in.  How about the 40 thousand fed ex ups dock that got used for a week.  The employees unload the trucks through a garage door.  Wintertime and rain seasons  wet slippery floors.  The employees thought it would be addressed they moved it from one end of the building to the to the other so the employees didn't have to move the unwrapped skids through the busy distribution center.  Safety only counts when its convenient.   I worked in that building 16 years.  From just after wfg consolidation.
good,Th drive for lean operations creates a environment where you are required to multitask and assure pin point accuracy in addressing the most critical daily priorities.
good,"Hay mucha inestabiliadd, ya que regularmente hacen despidos masivos"
good,"Long hours on an assembly line... If you don't mind putting the two screws in here, a plastic clip there and pushing a button in the same order over 400 times a day, 300 days a year, then it's the perfect job!"
good,Enjoyed going to work knowing I would be giving the most support to make sure goals were met. Safety was always top of the list and that's great to me.
good,"The work environment was demanding as well as physically and mentally challenging.  But I was good at my work, did not miss work but the market demand changed leaving me without a job. Not much hope of a call back.  I learned over 50 jobs while working there and I worked in many areas of the facility. Was willing to learn any job they needed me to learn i am very hands on and learn very quickly and was able to perform the job they placed me on. I was dependable reliable and could do anything they put in front of me ."
good,"This was a nice company to work for.  Advancement was not always available to the hourly worker, management usually moved management.  "
good,I love it just not for me. The pay is wonderful the benefits are even greater. Just working in business offices is what my career job is. Dealing with customers and helping others.
good,"You will work for people that have no clue about your job, responsibilities, or what it takes to do your job effectively. GM is a good company but unfortunately they promote dumb-azzes and kiss-azzes."
good,"Very repetitive day to day work. Great co-workers, enjoyed going to work. Tough, fast pass, challenging environment."
good,Work in 2 shifts and no stretching. You will have a predefined work for the day. 2 shifts to match the US timings. My last day was in Jun 2007 and have no idea of current work conditions.
good,"A typical day at work at GM would be very fast paced I would fasten steering rods to the car using an air gun, and clip the splashguards to the bottom."
good,"Upper management were goal oriented  for the own career. Work with the United auto workers, the were more knowledgeable, about the very day business and were team driven to meet the daily expectation's"
good,"ДМС и соц пакет присутствуют,спец одежда. Всё по расписанию. Одним словом конвейер.Каждый шаг прописан в стандартной работе.Работа, подобна работе робота.Премия 2 раза в год.Корпоративный отпуск."
good,"Boa empresa, com grandes benefícios e um bom local de trabalho, dinâmico."
good,"Boa empresa para se trabalhar. Trata se de uma multinacional."
good,"Good working environment and reasonable pay, temp job, performed multiple assignment."
good,"As security, i am limited to the information i put out, but the job it self was very easy, i never had any challenges there. I would patrol the buildings inside and out, check all safety requirements, be a first res ponder and dispatcher to emergencies, and write daily logs of what was done every hour, answer and direct phone calls. Drive injured/ sick employees to the nearest hospital and back to  work when they are done."
good,"The definition of insanity applies here. Great job, pay-wise, but the brick wall I keep banging my head into is getting harder."
good,Adhering to strict timelines of projects.Closure & handing over of Projects
good,Coordinated UAW production workers and First Time Quality on the V-8 Assembly Engine Line Team. Responsible for Safety and throughput goals and keeping assigned area organized.
good,Day at work is busy and filled with knowledge and learning.
good,Typical day at work:
good,Fast paced and loads of oppotunity if you know the right people. Very challenginfg and educational. Training was bar none
good,A typical day was steady time on a stamping mill line. Breaks were short but sufficient. Little time to get to know co-workers. Hardest thing was staying on my feet for hours on end in one spot.
good,"A empresa é uma mãe para o funcionário,  mas as pessoas que dirigem......."
good,"I had a great experience at GM, I spent 5 years there and I was the lead engineer of the group, but eventually, I quit my job due to blocking me from moving around departments and keeping me at the same grade level. A new employee with 2 years of experience joined the team and he has been placed a level higher than me. If the manager or the director is not a friend of yours, don't even think of a promotion! the outer culture of GM is changing but unfortunately, the mentality is still the same. I can't deny that GM is a great company but the mentality of some upper management personnel needs to be changed."
good,Dynamic and ever changing duties. Different responsibilities daily. Vast amount of freedom. Challenging problems which required solutions rather quickly.
good,"Lots of opportunities for ot. Great benefits. Poor work life balance, as most all ot is mandatory. Culture of atmosphere can be pretty poor, depending on your group lead."
good,"Unfortunately leaving Oshawa and I must move on as well. Lots of drive and a decent culture. Needs an overhaul in certain areas. A ton of work on getting new product in to save Oshawa fell upon deaf ears. If the doors would stay open and the opportunities were available I would stay in this facility. Learned an absolute ton, the rolls and responsibilities afforded to me in a very short time were great opportunities for me to grow. If you wanted a challenge or you are good at something they will challenge you. If you succeed, they will use your abilities in other areas to meet goals or targets."
good,"Como practicante era muy divertido ingresar al mundo automotriz aprendiendo cada dia cosas nuevas, desde la dirección hasta nivel operario"
good,"Infelizmente na General Motors ainda impera o tipo de apadrinhamento para vagas interessantes, porém sem dúvida uma empresa que me trouxe ganhos pessoais, que me trouxe um grande aprendizado profissional, e me proporcionou bons momentos profissionais"
good,Good place for a college hire to learn but too much bureaucracy. Good benefits.  Lot of micromanagement and bullying. great place for learning new technologies.
good,"My direct manager was excellent. However, managers above had no idea what work was being completed and did not play into the decision on layoffs that occurred."
good,"Enjoyable, fast-paced environment.  This was great learning experience, glad i was able to join the team for a short period of time before it closes permanently."
good,"Empresa com cultura da qualidade muito forte, muito aprendizado."
good,GM was a contract position so it is difficult to fully describe the true full time employee experience there. My contract position was only 2 months but I got the feeling from who I did work with were satisfied.
good,siempre hay algo nuevo que aprender en lo personal
good,"The pay is ok, contract work has no benefits. Short term contract. People are so afraid to lose their jobs, self job protection is the common culture. Very racist invirenment. Management is trying hard to hire more visible workers. But some workers still openly saying racist comments. There is a black engineer making the same mistakes as many white engineers did, but he got very bad comments behind his back. It was hard to listen to."
good,"Pros:  Exciting technology, good work life balance, casual dress"
good,"Pay is very good, neat experience to see how a car is built, great way to learn parts of a vehicle. Very fast paced,  robotic, can be taxing. Can be fun."
good,"Work is challenging and rewarding. Co-workers are great. The only down fall is GM is a large company and decisions made from disconnected corporate management effects every aspect of being employed here, job location, job scope, compensation, etc...."
good,"I am not satisfied with my position at this company. I was hired for a certain job and got demoted pretty much. I am definately not impressed with the service manager, he belittles employees and does not have the skills to get and keep employees or customers"
good,"Resolving employee conflict"
good,This is a Good company if you are a hired in employee not a temporary employee. Temporary employees do the same job and get treat like the don’t belong there.
good,People were nice is it clean environment workload was not too much caring people Close to home good hours but no job security did not receive benefits for paid vacations or ability to collect unemployment and no future there
good,"Start at 6;30am and never know what time you would be able to leave, if you got sick very rude and disrespectful. Dirty place to work. The men don't care how they talk around women."
good,"Empresa muito boa para trabalhar e até o ultimo momento que trabalhei nesta empresa tive sempre os benefícios que ela oferecia mantidos e nunca atrasou salários."
good,Started as a great place to work with good people. Eventually over-worked the employees due to economic times and stresses. No longer a part of General Motors. Foreign owners.
good,"Long hours fast paced with minimum time off for family Unless you have high seniority in the company also management isn't helpful, not a good place to move up career wise either unless you have been there for 15 to 20 years"
good,"Steady work environment, but poor communication between management and labor. Good team atmosphere, allowance for training, good safety practices. Pay scale better than most local employers."
good,"Great first job because every job thereafter seemed easy compared to this one.  It was really hard going from school to managing the UAW.  This review is from 2003-2006, I am sure it has changed quite a bit since then."
good,"Contract people have the low end of the stick in certain buildings. I would shy away from building 25. Constant budget movements, and losing my job at the drop of a hat."
good,"Cutting edge technology, one of  the best places to learn and grow in skills and knowledge. Encourage continued education and training...............!"
good,"Highly competitive management structure. Committed to safety, continuous improvement, and productivity. Benefits and pay on par with top 25 companies. Heavy investment in leading edge and innovative technologies."
good,"Ambiente dove si lavora molto bene se appassionati alla ricerca e sculippo,io qui ho imparato una professione,purtroppo c'è molta gelosia nel reparto e ciò porta a discissioni tra colleghi."
good,Dedicated 31 years of my life to General Motors.  Provided a good life for my family. It was stable but hard work. They need more jobs like this for the next generation!
good,"General Motors is a good company to work for; depending on the location and job title. The pay is good, and the benefits are great. "
good,">dia de trabalho intenso alta produtividade;"
good,"GM has its pros and cons. It hires as an employee and gives good benefits.  The compensation is above average. The bad part is the management is corrupt and outsourced many things to ireland. IF you are in IT, you will report to Irish managers. They work only eight hours due to their countries laws, but will make you work nearly 16-20 hours a day including weekends without any overtime. The American employees are discriminated. All promotion, education and goodies are given to Irish employees. The American worker will be working and saluting the irish boss just to be replaced once the irish learn your job."
good,"contato com fornecedores estrangeiros;"
good,Devido a situação de mercado a empresa não oferece nenhuma perspectiva de estabilidade.
good,He echo distintos tipo de trabajos dentro de gm y eso es lo que me a ayudado a que no sea rutinario es una empresa que ofrece muchas oportunidades a quienes demuestran compromiso y entusiasmo al ser una empresa de manufactura produce cambios constantemente que permiten renovarse y aprender nuevas cosas
good,"Aprendi a lidar com pressão, com o horário diferenciado de trabalho, trabalhar em equipe e com soldas."
good,"llevas a cabo los conocimiento adquiridos durante tu carrera, tienes apoyo hacia nuevas ideas de mejora y cambios en los procesos ya sea productivos tanto como de tu departamento, las personas tienen un nivel de dicipina ambiental muy agradable y unos horarios flexibles."
good,"arrive take 40 calls log them in create cases"
good,"Good experience and training opportunities. Not so good future plans at the company as most the products can be made in other countries that have competitive costs that reduce that ultimately will reduce long term employment and job security. Long hours that deprive home life and family involvement. When choosing a career with this company, plan on working many long hours, with little home time... Great for the single person, but not for the family oriented individuals."
good,Salary and Remuneration are too good and as per learning part can gain much knowledge for the future enhancement
good,"Good Company, departments are seperated by towers or buildings sometimes making it harder to get problems resolved. Email is the perfered method of communication at GM."
good,Worked well as team members collectively and cohesively managed 3 PC terminals tracking emergency PSAP ISOP requirements with MS Word Excel Documentation & Presentation Quality Assurance of all calls inbound/outboud
good,Co-workers and manager are very supportive
good,"Most of the people that you work with and/or around are friendly and like to talk, so the day of work is not as boring and you make friends."
good,"A GM é uma empresa dinâmica, que exige muita flexibilidade de processos devido a demanda extremamente volúvel consequência dos subsídios fiscais."
good,I dealt with people that were stranded on the side of the road. I enjoyed the job because I got to help people out in their time of need. The hardest part of my job was dealing with people when our service providers have taken too long to provide service to them. This was a call center so I did not have to much employee interaction.
good,"Typical day I was placed in positions that most of the regular hourly employees didn't want to work. Off- line sorts for defects, or on-line inspecting in one spot the intire day. When you did a offline sort you had to remove parts from one rack to another manually. There was sometimes you had to do some rework on the metal parts. In the summer time the lines that had the heavier parts and was a little hot some of the women wouldnt want to work those lines and I would enjoy going to those lines. I felt this was all giving me an advantage on different aspects of the jobs in different departments all over the plant. Meeting different people everyday was always good."
good,I don't actually have typica day at work couse i do work with people who can work with other people and we do understand each other very very well so ya!that's it.I have learn't a lot hence we sharing ideas and expiriences.Yha! jst like anywhere management its management those guys also have their pressures but we have a relationship we try not to step on each others toes if you know what i mean.Co- workers are fun people to work and be with.Is to extinguish the fire.
good,"My dutu hours are little bit complicated,because it is of 11-12 hours.Here,i got many chances to develope my self,i came to that type of exposure,in which i have established myself,marked changes in myself.Management was quite good.My co-workers are very co-operative.There isn't any hard part in job,but you have to be alert,when you have to satisfy the demanda of your customers by providing bulk quantity with good quality in their time period.As per my profile i have to check valves.So,if there won't be any complain,then it is going to be a nice experience for me"
good,"Overall I learned how to be a hard dedicated worker no matter the situation, I also learned how to manage a group of employees to produce the best vehicles with little to no defects"
good,Depending on what job you have and the location greatly depends on your work/home life balance. This also greatly effects how challenging and rewarding the job can be.
good,"It is very competitive and most dealerships are. This is a very ""every man for himself"" kind of environment. How ever there was manager in particular that genuinely cared about everyone success and managers like that are difficult to find. The money is definitely there if you are good at it. The top performers at my dealership made $65,000 the lowest make $25,000. When I say top performers these are seasoned Vets that know what they are doing."
good,"Buena empresa, pésima administración, no hay soporte por parte de los jefes y el ambiente laboral se llega a tornar muy denso"
good,Company upward movement was not available to everyone.  Even if you were an ace you needed to be considered a high pot to move upward.  Knowing the car business was not a prerequisite.
good,"I worked as an intern for GM inside one of its plants. My experience was not the best as I was essentially a human copier, and a paper organizer. However may of the other interns loved it there."
good,"The company is good w.r.t Work Life Balance (theoretically). "
good,"Worked here for two and a half years as a temp employee. No benefits,no paid time off, ""Not supposed to take time off while sick while being temporary employee"". Required to pay union dues while receiving no representation. While I was appreciative of the job, putting forth 100% effort and gaining respect from everyone in my work environment  proved to be fruitless. At the end of the day I was still a number on a list waiting to be acknowledged regardless of any effort"
good,I choose to reserve my review of my current Manger  and co- workers at this time.  I find the office to be pleasant despite a general attitude of non urgent response and feedback.
good,Great place to work have great benefits work place was clean you never had to worry about getting to dirty GM was also a pretty safe place to work. The only thing that’s not to like is some times team concepts gets loss in process.
good,The company made you feel replaceable all the time. I worked as a tpt there and was laid off numerous times for no reason. the pay is great. management was good for the most part
good,"The people are great, but management or upper management has become unreasonable over the last couple of years. Also, what company lays off people when they are doing well?"
good,GM treats exceptionally in benefits and compensation but the work life balance is really hard especially in Operations. The need to hit benchmarks often clouds what’s realistically attainable.
good,"fun place to work, everyone there treats you like family and the pay was pretty good for a college kid. could choose what shifts i wanted to pick up. sucks its being shut down now"
good,"Expect to work almost every day and 11 hour days but it is automatically part of the gig. Your top sales people  work about 55 hours week. Pay ranges from 24,000/year minimum to $64,000 to the very maximum."
good,"My job was challenging. The work was good, but sometimes managers did not support the outlined processes. The most enjoyable part of the job was my direct team. We had great camaraderie."
good,"Most folks are familiar with GM.  It makes great products and has great people.  In my particular division, I felt that extremely intelligent people were misunderstood and undervalued.  Nevertheless, I am thankful for the experience and retirement."
good,my job as an skilled support was temp with no promise of full time. I liked working here it was close too home with good pay. the work wasn't hard and I learned no skills
good,Its a great company the pay is great and they give you amazing bonuses and it's free health care coverage for you and your family and the job is very easy for the money they pay
good,"This was a temporary position, thus there were no vacations or benefits, but I did pay union dues.  Overall I enjoyed my short time there, the people were the best part."
good,"GM IT transitioned from mostly all contract workers to in-sourcing 90% of their work force. No real processes are being actively/consistently followed and the rules are ever changing. Employees need to constantly be flexible and not have expectations on what is expected. Great for people wanting to climb the ladder but if wanting to grow technical skill, you may find yourself pigeon holed. The culture between each location is vastly different."
good,los horarios se hacían bastante largos en especial cuando te obligaban a quedarte a tiempo extra
good,"Aprendi a llevar una vida laboral, en la que se presentan retos diarimente."
good,Uncertainty of a career in the automotive industry and looking to advance. Career advancement at General Motors was extremely competitive and experience did not always prevail.
good,"I really enjoyed my time at GM. I enjoyed working with and meeting new people. No flexibility with the schedules. Benefits/ compensation were a plus. Being on an ""indefinite lay off"" answers the job security question in itself. Management had very little structure and poor communication."
good,"Work pace was good - colleagues very good to work with. "
good,General Motors is a great opportunity to make a healthy salary while maintaining a healthy physical lifestyle. General Motors provided the opportunity of learning to adapt to a variety of jobs quickly while maintaining a consistent schedule.
good,"If you manage to stay long enough to get on full-time, the benefits are good. As a temp, it's horrible. And people can remain temps for up to 7 years per the last contract with the union, which is extremely weak here in Bowling Green."
good,"Weekdays in the office are uneventful, consist of planning maintenance work to occur on the weekend. Management is nice, but most managers are spineless."
good,Se trabaja mucho en equipo por lo que se debe tener mucha vocacion a trabajar con otras personas con diferentes puntos de vista. Aprendi muchas cosas de mi profesion que no habia realiazado como el area de Analisis Financiero
good,I am not interested in sending a review at this time. I have no opinions regarding General Motors whether positive or negative at this time.  This is my position.
good,"Excelente para quem procura entrar no mercado de trabalho devido ao turn over da empresa estar sempre selecionando novas pessoas. "
good,You will be exposed to mind games from management & the UAW.  As woman you will always have to defend your abilities to do any job. This work isn't for everyone & will tear your body up.
good,A very busy working environment.  A lot of hustle and bustle. The industry was new to me when i started so i have learnt a lot and grown in the industry.
good,I enjoyed working at the Orion Assembly plant. I was only a Temporary employee but I got to learn numerous jobs which was my favorite part of the whole work experience! The first 2 to 3 weeks are the hardest physically and emotionally. Most of the people are great to work with. There's always a few too many negative people in the work place anyways.
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo en un dia tipico de trabajo
good,"All in all a good place to work, especially for the money and benefits you receive for having no post high school education.  Management is inconsistent and the schedule changes frequently."
good,"Drove a forklift to deliver parts to the production line, good place to work. I was a temporary employee, if I had been hired as a seniority employee, I would have made a career there."
good,"They have a clean work environment, great team leaders, great break and lunch schedules, nice people to train you, hardest part of the job is pushing large carts loaded with parts . learning new jobs is the best part, knowledge is power."
good,Overall the culture has been improving but many managers still look out for themselves. Promotions are tougher to achieve. I would recommend working but you need to make sure you will be working for a manager that wants you to succeed.
good,A very transparent and progressive company that looks after its workforce and the future of their kids or family. It is an employer of choice and can recommend to those I know
good,por mi parte si aprendí muchas cosas nuevas en mi periodo en la empresa ya que esta muya automatizada  y mucha tecnología en la planta
good,"The workers made the job, in my opinion. The job in itself was tedious and overbearing but the people you were surrounded by, for the most part, made the job manageable."
good,"I have 4+ years of experience in this esteemed organisation. I am into Quality function, designated as "" Deputy Manager "" in Global Propulsion System. "
good,i learned almost every job in the plant .Most of fellow workers were very helpful in training. Most team leaders were very helpful and cared about their workers.
good,"Acredito que a General Motors seja uma excelente empresa,"
good,"Long shifts, many tasks with many micro managing staff members, Excellent co-workers. Wages are capped within a year of employment."
good,"I loved working at the Warren Tech Center. My job was not hard at all, the management is very professional. I loved the environment, great atmosphere to work in."
good,Low pay grades for Team Leaders. Co workers are great at sharing best practices. Training is effective and great. Room for advancement is limited based on who your direct report is which makes it difficult to advance. Lots of tenure.
good,"This is a great place to work if you don't mind monotony. The work is very repetitive. They do have various shifts so its helpful in balancing school, work, and family."
good,"Working in the call center was micro-management at it's finest. Down to the very minutes of even your bathroom breaks. However, the atmosphere was fun and delightful. The workplace was enjoyable."
good,"General Motors is a great company to work for. They also have quarterly Bonuses. I have been employed there for about a year and I enjoy what I do, however I am in the process of Finishing my bachelors and GM does not offer tuition reimbursement."
good,General motors was a hard job to get use to but when I finally did I made a lot of friends and some money. I was a temp. for four years so I didn't have benefits.
good,"un día laboral es perfectamente laborable siempre y cuando se excedan las cargas de trabajo y el Timing de los entregarles."
good,Working as a Production Supervisor can be quite rewarding and the compensation is good.  The quality of life is not for a person who has a family and wants to see them.  Off shifts are why I left.
good,"Un dia en el trabajo......"
good,they are friendly and family oriented..everyone helps and very team oriented..friendly and courteous staff and management
good,"Great company overall, in my location I was not able to advance or have chances to interface with the headquarters staff, so I moved to gain other opportunities."

good,"eu trabalhei por 11 anos nessa empresa, desde o dia que fui desligado foi só aprendizado, cresci como profissional, ser humano, colaborador, e atuei em muitas áreas, tenho uma facilidade de ser comunicativo, por isso conquistei diversas amizades, eu não via as dificuldades como coisa ruim, pois quando aprendia aquela atividade era uma experiência a mais, por isso foi uma experiência vasta, aliei o prazer de trabalhar, vestindo a camisa da empresa com muito orgulho, aliado ao estudo, pois essa empresa me deu a possibilidade de me graduar, e além disso me possibilitou conquistar  diversos sonhos e possibilidades."
good,As a supervisor the job was rewarding and the results from the workers were ever changing. Job security was an issue because you never knew from day to day what to expect.
good,"Trabalho bom, ambiente agradável, boa administração, razoável no ambiente de funcionários, muita cobrança sem muito retorno, mas com boa organização na rotina do trabalho."
good,"Challenging work, colleagues are nice. Lot of work loads, not very suitable for promotion even after hard work. Not enough vacation for entry level."
good,This is part of General Motors and I have already gave my comments. GM was a great company and at that time everyone wanted to work there
good,Things in the company move very slowly. Most managers are competent but the work culture there makes it difficult to work at times.
good,"òtima empresa de se trabalhar, cumpre com prazos quanto a salario e beneficios."
good,"The position gets very busy at times, but it is great experience!! Wonderful way to learn more about the automotive industry."
good,interaction with union and T/M was the biggest challenge in addition to ensuring you met you daily production goals and KPI
good,I worked on an assembly line and with a team. The management were always trying to work with you to make your job easier and better.
good,"Não tenho muito o que falar, pois trabalhei apenas 2 anos, nesses dois anos a rotina de trabalho era normal, epis sempre limpos, no posto de trabalho era feito um rodizio hora hora, para evitar a ler, a supervisão eu não tinha muito contato, porem as poucas vezes que conversei sempre pareceu tranquilo, os colegas mais experientes sempre apoiavam nos que eramos novatos, a parte mais dificil do trabalho era quando o ct coordenador de time não tinha um bom relacionamento com os membros do time, e a parte agradavel é o contrario da parte dificil."
good,"8-5 job where I interacted with all kinds of people through the phone, e-mail, and face to face."
good,"- A cada 2 horas os operadores mudavam de posto de trabalho, fazendo uma rotação entre o time, isso ajudava de certa forma para não desgastar o operador."
good,Salary & Union war always at odds with each . This made it a bad place to work some days.I learn to enjoy it after 10 yrs or so.
good,Me ayudo bastante en trabajar con seguridad y responsabilidad con mi persona y para con los demas.
good,A lot of long hours every week day with some overtime but I had great workers on my line. The money was very good and it was nice to have the shift work so I knew when I was working and could plan around my shifts
good,Creo que si dieran más incentivos el personal se motivaría más hace malta ese tipo de motivaciones
good,"Coming out of college, GM is a wonderful company to start one's career. The support of the management has helped me to develop and understand my potential, while instilling confidence to succeed in my career."
good,"It seems that management and the union would rather fight about everything than to actually get any work done, I am looking for a job where I can use my degree I just earned at UofM in Business."
good,"At General Motors I was assigned three different areas of concentration: Fixtures ( working with CAD designers to implement design), overseeing the Structural Test Lab, Drive Line Bending (at the Pontiac Dyno facility).  "
good,"General Motors is a good company to work for,  their pay and benefits are excellent compared to other jobs in the area.  Hours can me long at times but overall a good company"
good,"Empresa boa para trabalhar, apesar de nos últimos anos ter decaído muito. Houveram mudanças globais que afetaram os funcionários de forma direta."
good,"Great atmosphere to work in as long as you don’t get caught up in the political aspect that’s in there. It’s a union job; great if you’re connected to family in the union. However, trying to get hired on full-time takes too many years. They lay people off to never call them back to work!"
good,"Things I learned:"
good,"Ambiente de extremo stress e dinâmico, mas o salário compensa."

good,"Great environment to work in General motors with the teams and good benefits from the company, good projects and with great management  and new techonolgies"
good,"Good place to work with decent opportunities.  "
good,"Aprendi nessa empresa a trabalhar em equipe, com respeito mutuo a todos, sempre tendo todo apoio da gerencia, com uma cultura de confiança os funcionarios."
good,"This was and can still be a great company to work for. The problem comes from unskilled educated degrees in management. It’s not what you know, it’s how long you’ve been with the company...for job advancement."
good,it was a nice job but i was a flex employee which meant no overtime and nothing over 32 hours a week. days were easy it was the engine and power train plant. they roated every hour to 30 minutes. i dont have a bad thing to say about that plant

good,GM was a good place to work. The work was challenging and sometimes rewarding  Most employees were very friendly. The building amenities we nice to have to at the Renaissance Center.
good,"Projects are very interesting, down side is most employee's fall into a cookie cutter career advancement which can take a while to advance your career."
good,"Working 6 days a week, 49 hours a week with only 5 call in days a year. Working every Saturday with no choice. I learned a lot about working on an assembly line and building the product. Management is not on your side, they do not care about personal life or issues in the real world outside of their doors, or even if you are sick. There are a few who are the exception, most of those came from the assembly line themselves."
good,"If the political drama between union and management would disappear,  it'd be a dream job. If management showed they cared,  every employee would ACTUALLY be treated fairly."
good,Es una buena empresa solo Se recomienda valorar los horarios y capacitación para areas superiores
good,A General Motors  pra mim foi  e é a maior fabrica de veículos fo Brasil.
good,"General Motors not only did a lot for its Employee's,  but went beyond. Also, there was a lot expected from the Employees.  The problems was management allowed too much leeway,  and of course it is natural instinct for people to take advantage. The people,  and job was great, for most. For me, it was too repetitive of the same in and same out, I needed more as far as stimulation the mind."
good,"In 1985 I became the first woman to enter the Millwright Trade at the Lake Orion Assembly facility; at that time there were only approximately 30 women  in the Millwright Trade nationwide. The millwright workforce was not receptive of women entering this trade, one of the last factions of Skilled Trades at General Motors to not include women in 1985. There was not much support from either the UAW or the company at that time, therefore my success as a Millwright, and I was successful, was based on my own determination to succeed."
good,Typical work environment for the automotive industry. Interesting work experiences with multiple problem solving opportunities.  Good benefits and bonuses.
good,"I worked in final processing in the tent outside at the DHAM plant, my team(subcontractors) and the GM employees became a family quickly and everything ran smoothly, and when it wasn't we as a team addressed the concerns and decided how to move forward so we can get as many cars done as possible. I enjoyed our lunches together where we would potluck, or even go to the gym and workout together on lunch it was awesome."
good,"Good place to work and focused on work. It was a fun place to work & thing are changing. Always getting project completed on time, good team building. Things are changing with just numbers rather the business support."
good,I was disappointed that lordstown closed because it was a nice place to work. Most of the people there were great. Offered relocation when plant shut down.
good,"While working for GM, I worked in Youngstown,  OH, Baltimore, MD and Wilmington,  DE.  I worked through out the production process doing any and all work assignments given to me.  The work was fulfilling,  stressful, rewarding and always necessary.  Assisted in planning, writing job instructions and any special assignments that came my way.  Even thru three plant closings, I would not change a thing."
good,Company has old bones. Going to take a long time to transition to a modern tech company. Had a bad manager who had never done the job I was doing and he didn't understand how long things take to do.
good,"Learned a substantial amount about quality. Worked in a fast paced environment. Making change was easy and it was quick to see the fruits of your labor. Very flexible work schedule, ability to work from home. Highly compensated, bonuses and pay raises were great."
good,Require overtime almost every weekend. Job security for mangers is not great. Great place to learn about lean manufactory and operation skills. The pay is great but you have to live at the plant.
good,"Slow on Change, has a problems looking at new technologies and processes. An attitude that this is the way we have always done it."
good,"Good company to work for, archivable deadlines and great training experience in the latest software and technology. Excellent benefits and compensation, a very professional company."
good,Got screwed by downsizing with no explanation as to why. Twenty years seniority (35 total years including contract) didn't mean anything. Just shows that people are on the bottom of their list.
good,Being a temp at GM I never know which job I'm going to do each day. Most temps do different jobs each day. The hardest part of the job is not knowing which job I will be placed on each day because some jobs are harder than others. Most enjoyable thing of the job is most of the people I work with.
good,"Great place for medical benefits at 91 days, easy money, temps are not hired unless you're there 2-5 years, mandatory shifts on weekends, UAW union worker 1st day."
good,"Challenging place to work, with never ending opportunities to expand your work experience.   Was able to support multiple area of the the business including Finance, Engineering, Manufacturing, Sale & Marketing, Contract Management and Warehouse Distribution."

good,"Great job! Horrible Union that doesn't care about there workers they just want your money. Great work life balance. Management is good, and upper management is great."
good,The business is changing and revamping the entire organization.  This has caused a tremendous amount of stress on all employees. Jobs are being cut while others are taking on additional work.
good,"Work-life balance - Very Good"
good,working conditions are good and most people are general friendly and easy to work with.   Minimal overtime work required.  Most co workers will try to help to complete task but are hesitant to share all information
good,No puedo evaluar 400 horas de prácticas. mi trabajo era de becario y no puedo evaluar nada interno de la empresa porque no estuve el tiempo suficiente como para elaborar una valoracion justa.
good,Different brands work differently; Some are more old school (keep your head down and show up at a certain time) whereas in other teams - come and go as you please as long as your work is getting done
good,"Most non- salary workers do not receive raises and get NO paid time off. When lay-offs start happening, contractors are shown the door first, even though they work right alongside salary workers, doing the same job."
good,"Laid back and you do everything by the honor rule. You can work your own hours. Depending on your manager, you can also work from home. Work/life balance is second to none."
good,"In the company there is a great environmental in relation with peers and the way of working, the behaviors of employees are smooth and relax and the communication for activities, goals and results of the company are always clear. I really enjoy working at this company"
good,fair pay for fair days work. Can be rewarding if you are able to learn a variety of different job operations. Health and safety a top priority. New hires as of three years ago started at a graduated wage. Have no idea what they are earning now.
good,"General Motors is making lots of changes.  Yet to be determined what they will look like in the long term.  Many neat projects to be worked on at General Motors, but be cautious of the 'relationships' throughout the ranks at GM."
good,Empresa que visa o bem estar do colaborador e muito eficiente.
good,Pretty good place to work. I've been a contract employee since on/off since 92.  I love the people and the assignments however the pay could be better.
good,Good place to work and good hours.I had the opporunity ot think creatively and put my ideas to work in practical applications.Fair compensation and vacation for average achievers. Fair benefits for those who are not new hires. Generally good people to work with.
good,i did not like the work environment while at GM. I was a temporary employee in which they gave us no real benefits 3 unpaid vacation days which had to be pre-approved. It seemed like there was no real hiring process seeing as their were temps there who worked for 3 years or more without being hired.
good,Excellent company to work for. It has a lot interesting challenges and tough routes to follow. Good work life balance and the ability to work from home.
good,"During my time at this establishment I was a temporary employee. Temps are treated rather unfairly in comparison to hired-in employees. No time off, no sick days, but pay is not bad. Benefits for hired in employees are excellent however. Only trick is getting hired in. I was a temp for over a year"
good,"General Motors IT centers are a great experience for those new to the software development field. While not immediately, new technologies and tools slowly work their way into the company, and as a college hire you're exposed to all the major practices in the field. College hires also receive a compounding raise of 2.5% every six months for the first three years. Because of the size of the company, bureaucracy is rampant and getting tools approved or even newer versions of tools can be a painstaking process. Testing and CI/CD lag behind more modern practices."
good,Automotive OEM with technology and vehicles.  good perks and generally good place to work depending on your role and direct supervisor.  not really that much else to say
good,Empresa muito boa para se trabalhar e adquirir conhecimento profissional
good,Production supervision at General Motors can be very challenging.  Management sets up schedules that basically force you to work every other weekend.  There seems to be a constant turnover of people so the training is an ongoing process.
good,"Great company but is in dare need of some high management replacement. The company is incredible and is in the top 5 worldwide because it deserves, but need to pain attention to the inside, particularly some management people."
good,The company has stood the test of time and allows for employees to discover what they love about themselves through their work experience. A very diverse work environment is always a plus and that is what they provided.
good,"I have been a team leader at general motors in every area I have worked. I have bee  fortunate to have grrat team members in every area, who worked with me to make the jobs better an more productive. The teams i have been a team leader always made my job easier, and I was able to concentrate on making the jobs better for my team."
good,"Great compensation but work you to death, hardest part is that we work every weekend and the work life balance is horrible at this place. Management needs work but what place doesnt."
good,General Motor is a great company. It has a lot of overworking employees. Sometimes we have to work overtime as senior employees. We have a lot of meeting.
good,"pay was good, benefits were good, supervision was great, loved workout facility, learned a lot about the big three, typical day at work Meeting prepare for any problems on line then nice paced day"
good,I worked here over 30 years ago. It was s great place to work then however I cannot speak to how it it is now. While I was there it was a cohesive work environment.

good,"General Motors is a global automotive company united by a single purpose to earn customers for life. "
good,"I enjoyed assisting many different customer. I loved the fact that not only do they encourage new ideas, but that they actually implemented my idea to help better inform our customers and better assist them in managing their financial account with GMAC."
good,Provided plenty of opportunity for lean thinkers.  People that are motivated to think and teach lean practices this environment is for you.  A total transformation occurred in last ten years with continuous improvement the goal of every event.

good,"Wonderful work/life balance, great benefits, wonderful vision from leadership, changing culture "
good,"Typical day involved: Job Work/Life Balancing, Compensation/Benefit management, Job Security/Advancement structuring, Management and Job Culture developments. Most enjoyable part of the job was pay check and getting home safely."
good,"GM is a good employer, but it lives up to its reputation as a bureaucratic, silo'd organization. You can easily get transferred to another manager, and in time you will. Travel lightly, because the work location is no more stable."
good,"Whether it's some stupid drive to great no one cares about, or some vision that has nothing to do with my day to day activites, they have no clue what they are talking about."
good,I learned to power through even though you have limited manpower. An everyday struggle created opportunity for new challenges to get over. You must face challenges everyday in order to get through the day.
good,"una empresa de las mas importantes de la región, excelente ambiente para el desarrollo de habilidades"
good,"Getting to learn about the industry was fantastic. Also, having the opportunity to get hands-on experience to create and manage an on campus event was excellent. I enjoyed it."

good,"Experience in Global Business Services primarily."
good,"Retired from the original GM in 2008 before they filed for bankruptcy."
good,People at GM are very friendly even though the job may be stressful.  Enjoyed my time there.  The manager had little to no experience in the role he was playing.
good,The hardest part of my job on the assembly line. Doing the same thing  which never changed and trying to keep your mind active and staying out of the drama.
good,"trabajo muy bueno,aprendi muchas cosas,muy buena cobertura social y remuneracion.lo que no me agrado mucho es que no cuidan mucho al personal,no valoran mucho el presentismo del trabajador pese a cualquier circunstancia que le aparezca al empleado para no cumplir con su trabajo y aun asi cumple.companerismo muy bueno,lo normal para poder trabajar en equipo sin dificultades."
good,"target rich environment..."
good,It isn't everyday you get to be part of such rich history.  The culture is improving and it is a pretty fun environment.  Learned a great deal on how things work in the corporate world.
good,The job was a great paying job. It was just to much chaos with the other employees just coming in to do there job & not socialize. They also have great benefits.

good,"A typical day at work included miscellaneous duties which included reviewing, creating and streamlining procedures for the department. I learned how each department complimented one another.

good,"A typical day at work consists of checking daily emails, handling purchase orders, and ordering robotic parts. The people are friendly and well educated. The management is superb, and not too strict. The hardest part of the job would have to be walking to different areas of the huge facility to complete certain tasks. The most enjoyable part of the job is the lack of micro-management. I really enjoy the freedom. I've learned about an honor-system that is hard to believe still exists today."

good,"Only worked here for an internship, but GM took very good care of me and provided me with exceptional experience in the automotive industry."
good,"Job gets boring after awhile and upper management has their favorites. So far from what I see, they shuffle the quality personal around to fix the mistakes that others have made."
good,"Contract will be a pivotal time at this plant.  the people are good to work with, direct supervisors are good to work with.  machining lines,  assembly lines, none of the jobs i've encountered are overly physical or laborious.  too bad management is looking to reduce their costs by contracting out our jobs to the lowest bidder.  Eventually they will pull of Canada all together...."

good,"I liked the fact that you were busy, and the cars kept coming which made your day go by fast. You got a 20 minute break and a 30 minute break.

good,"I started working 3rd shift being a weekend warrior. Then I got the opportunity with me working so hard. I was offering full time 2nd shift. Don't get me wrong I loved working for GM, but it was Very hard work. I learned so much working in Trim department. It was so Awesome to build trailblazers. My coworkers were very helpful. Hardest part would be having one minute to do each vehicle and making sure you don't shut the line down. I really thought I was going to retire from GM , but the company took a turn for the worst and the plant closed, which was very hard to believe. I learned so much and worked so hard, I really miss that place."

good,"Not very fun if you are contract, nothing more to say!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
good,"The biggest thing I can take away from my time at GM is that I learned so much. There is plenty of information out there for one to get a hold of about this company and they do a good job of making it easy.  The things I learned were not necessarily taught to me by a co-worker, I learned a lot from just daily reading that is sent out by the company.  The process of the foundry is very interesting and has many moving parts.  After living here my whole life, it was nice to finally see what literally drives this area.  GM Defiance has several departments that deal with multiple different things.  These departments do not always get along and people seem to always think they can think of a better process than someone else and there tends to be a lot of confusion between the different areas.  That is really my only complaint about this job.  I do not think that factory life is for me, but I definitely enjoyed the learning aspect of this experience."

good,"Uma empresa com nome muito bom no mercado de trabalho onde todos tem orgulho de falar, aprendi a ter uma outra visão quando você trabalha em uma empresa multinacional,a hierarquia valoriza o contato com todos sem distinção de cargo , o ambiente de trabalho junto ao colegas tem boa comunicação, onde todos se respeitam, a parte que considero mais difícil foi não ter tido a oportunidade de mostrar mais o que sei de acordo com meu perfil, e a parte mais agradável do trabalho foi conhecer a logística da empresa."
good,GM was a good place to work. Friendly co-workers and reasonable management. Unfortunately advancement is done only through political connections.

While working at General Motors I learned great team working skills.No matter who made the mistakes we applied team effort to fix them.The management team was good.They were sometimes really busy,but that was understandable.

good,"Uma empresa onde se faz uso muito bem da parte teórica, porém as situações do dia a dia, faz com que você haja totalmente diferente de tudo que já é pré determinado. O trabalho em si é bem dinamico, com colegas de trabalhos muito ativos acabam facilitando seu dia a dia"

good,"On an everyday basis I enjoyed working for Vauxhall Motors, My duties included feeding the line with parts which challenged my ability to work to tact time. The most enjoyable part of my job was working as part of a strong fun team keeping ontop of a demanding production line."
good,My coworkers were good to work with and made the shifts go by fairly good. Since it was a job that is dictated by market demand it was a bit of a roller coaster for job security.
good,Ability to work with many different people. Learn and complete jobs at a very quick pace. Monitored ongoing efficiency to maintain productivity and quality. Wonderful experience to work for such a large company and view many aspects of what is required to run an automotive maufacturer.

good,Work place organize strong work ethics and family setting .Ive learned the importance's of doing the job well and right the first time. co workers hard working family men and woman . The hardest part of the job was the lay offs . The greatest part the job was the hours the benefits and pay rate .
good,Fast paced factory that was high on quality based on the product produced. On first arrival at this plant production was just starting up on a new engine. At the end of my time there the plant was producing more than two thousand engines per shift. Qualty was very high and consistent with all requirements. My final job was machining of engine blocks with required tool changes and quality checks.
good,"i worked there for 3 years in scanning parts, shipping and receiving"
good,"They invest into the future looking at the broad picture. I learned a lot mostly by being thrown into the job and learning as I go. This is not always a bad scenario as I believe you learn and retain what you know because of all the reach you have to do. However, management was not real support and lots of competitiveness among themselves. Co-workers were the best. I learned so much from them as they did from me. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a diverse group of people."
good,Everyone at the plant had strong ideas and ambition. lovely to work with. always encouraged you to do better. always seeked to improve innovations within the plant and people.
good,Fantastic team and working environment. It was a great place to work with a variety of people and teams. It will be greatly missed due to the closing.
good,"Typical office environment. Little in the way of training, but if you already have the skills they're looking for then you won't be mis-used, however if you don't then don't expect for anyone to know quite what to do with you. Perhaps it's merely failure of their interviewing process, or they didn't know quite what they wanted."
good,"Working at General Motors on the management side can be very stressful and demanding at times. Not only are you responsible for monitoring and maintaining the productivity of your team but also the quality of the product leaving your area. There's a natural clash between management and union members, but this on-going struggle coupled with various personal issues many union members may be facing can create a difficult work environment. Finding a way to effectively lead each individual, as well as your entire team, can be tricky. When you're able to establish those working relationships and identify strategies to help everyone be successful, that's when you excel. The management team is great - very knowledgeable, helpful and reliable. Most would say the most rewarding aspects of the job would be watching the final products drive off the line, but I personally see more value in helping team members (union and salary) improve their overall body of work and better themselves both personally and professionally."
good,"Fiquei por 20 anos na empresa, cresci profissionalmente e pessoal"
good,"Work and home life balance was so hectic. It seemed like work was always first. Work place Culture!!!! The hardest part of the job was to try to deliver 10 things, when 20 we're required."
good,Working in a fast-paced environment taught me how to be efficient and yet quality at the same time. My job was to do paintless dent repair which involves removing dents from cars as they were coming down the production line for finish in shipping. I had approximately 1 minute 30 seconds to complete my tasks. I was highly commended on my quality of work.
good,"Empresa ótima para se trabalhar, com bons benefícios e oportunidades de aprendizado. Porém nos últimos anos, em algumas áreas ficou instável para se trabalhar, com muitas mudanças de direção."
good,I work in a very fast paced environment. A lot of stressful situations occur when having to fix a car in a limited amount of time or find enough man power to cover calls outs on the line. Lots of interaction with workers on a day to day basis.

good,"A empresa provê um aprendizado diário, com grandes profissionais dispostos a compartilhar conhecimento, a cultura é de empresa americana e de pouca autonomia, a partir mais difícil do são as tomadas de decisão por serem lentas e a melhor parte sãó os produtos de qualidade que são entregues todos dão o seu melhor para entregar um produto com qualidade ao cliente."
good,"GM is a big organisation with a diverse portfolio and many projects. It has a great work culture and I enjoyed my time there. Everything was spot-on except for one thing. Instability. There is a great level of instability in your career especially for contract employees who toil really hard and get the job done. Had there been better job security, people would love to work at GM."
good,"I enjoyed working there but because of how they hire people you may not last long due to layoffs. Otherwise it has to be the safest, cleanest, and relaxed places I've worked. They take the time to train you properly and they make sure your comfortable before having you work alone. Management was on top of problems and they took most things said by employees seriously."
good,"I enjoyed my time working with General motors, although  I had joined the team just before its closure date I still made good money, worked with good people and was able to learn many things within working there. overall I had a great experience working for this company."

good,"My experience working as a contractor for General Motors was a good experience  I was trained by a manager , I enjoyed working with the Payroll team and I wish I could again work there"
good,"Instabilidade de rotinas , prejudicando rendimento da enfermagem."

good,"GM is a great company.  "
good,"Although I resigned from GM after only 2 years, I still appreciate the exposure to real world code discrepncies. I do wish they had a more competative and challenging environment."
good,"General Motors was good to me.  There was opportunity for growth and movement. The pay and benefits were good, but benefits for salary employees has taken a hit in recent years.  That was the biggest issue."
good,"The last year has been stressful with 1,000's of people losing their job. The hardest part was waiting several months from the announcement of job loss to the actual week that people were walked out."
good,Puede tener mejoras respecto al trato con el personal.
good,"As I worked over the years, was able to have my education paid for by the company (masters).  "
good,"Review Projects, metrics and mentor PM's. I was a true believer in GM. Was released because of restructuring efforts. When I look at some of the people that remain in my group I clearly see my Manager did not know what we did or were capable of doing."
good,"I was working for GM Canada for several years, both contract and permanent positions. I worked with many people and made many great friends, office or plant people. Working for GM was a pleasant experience overall but, there are hardly any advancement opportunities for immigrants"
good,Depending on what building or state you worked in dictated how your work day went.  The day to day was routine mostly. The only major change was when layoffs were annouced.  I was part of the lay offs and it affects everyone differently.  But the mood leading up to and the days of were very stressful for all.
good,Trabalho enxuto processo moderno carga de trabalho excessiva
good,A empresa fornece plenas condições de aprendizado em um ambiente altamente complexo e  de alto investimento. Muito aprendizado sobre o processo operacional e gestão bem como relacionamento com ao ambiente corporativo. Uma verdadeira escola de formação de profissionais.
good,It was a good company while I was there.  Great benefits great team mates. Opportunity to advance and move around when ever there was not a job freeze preventing lateral and promotional opportunity was plentiful.  Choices in management are questionable and company direction were also questionable.  All in all i wish the company the best and I would consider going back if called upon to do so.

good,"Work is depending on company direction, thus not much you can put too much personal color."
good,"I have just lost my job at GM due to a cost savings cut.  I LOVED MY JOB.  I was great at my job.  I was loved at my job.  But, a decision made 6 levels above me sealed my fate.  I was a great employee and loved and spoke highly of company.  They totally decimated the engineering process at my location.  Which will cause great problem with the future products for the company.  They also kept employees that do nothing to better the company.  So, in my opinion the company made a great mistake in the way they saved money for the company."
good,"Uma ótima empresa para se trabalhar, uma pena não possuir um plano de carreira para que os funcionários que estejam dispostos a buscar um cargo melhor na empresa."
good,"Decent place to work. Requires a lot of flexibility especially in terms of developing knowledge in many different areas. This is offset by a collabrative and helpful culture which utilizes various knowledge sharing techniques to upskill people from knowledge sharing sessions, to mentoring to designed and tailored training programs."
good,The company is restructuring for the future. The emphasis is on electrification of vehicles and autonomous ride sharing. The work spaces are being transformed from cubicles to an open office environment.
good,"This company was the best place to work, but finance issues caused prioritize low salaries instead of high experience. Its a good place to start you career."
good,Competitive and challenging work environment that can yield several rewards and recognitions.  Work life balance can also be challenging at times as the mandatory overtime and hours put in can increase drastically.
good,Employees have potential to grow and advance in their careers. Good workplace culture. Management considers your opinion while making decisions that affect you.
good,"Working at General Motors is a great way to learn about the automotive industry, lot of new innovations. Based on your role, if you are in the field as a travelling District Manager you will learn about how marketing programs that are received by the purchasing public. At head office, you will have a chance to learn how business processes and analysis can make a large impact on the lives of employees at dealerships nationwide."
good,The job was very good in all but once you get hurt up there they will treat you like you tried to injury yourself. They treat you like dirt and talk to you crazy.
good,Uma ótima empresa voltaria à trabalhar nela se tivesse oportunidade.
good,Work environment was nice but almost no space to advance to a higher level. GMSA has left SA and that is why I do not have a job anymore. I have obtained a lot of knowledge at GMSA.
good,"people i work with were friendly and work well to gather."
good,"This was a great place to learn and get great training."
good,I would of loved working for General Motors but it was through a temporary service and the assignment only lasted about a year. I received a call back about two months later wanting me to return but I had already received another position at another company
good,"local agradável, e com pessoas agradáveis de se trabalhar."
good,"The Milford Proving grounds are some of the most fascinating and high complex testing facilities in the world.  If and automotive test can be conceived, it can be performed at Milford."
good,"Always room for growth. However, this company has been great to work for. Mentorship is available and management encourages the pursuit of career advancement."
good,"Bom ambiente de trabalho, bons benefícios, só o que deixa a desejar são os tratamentos recebidos dos chefes."
good,"Had good repour with manager"
good,"General Motors una gran escuela , enfocada al trabajo en equipo . Siempre algo que resolver todos los dias .Mucha tolerancia que pienso que fue lo mas difícil de aprender, pero valió la pena."
good,working at General motors as a mech/continuous improvement engineer was a great learning experience and will hopefully jumpstart my career with their experience behind me
good,Nice to work at GM! Good experience so far apart from normal corporate politics and poor management. Pays good but no career advancement unless you have good connections.
good,management sucks at times there a few good supervisors overall work climate is ok with great benefits and pay once hired in lots of overtime and some times forced average GM part of the UAW which is great cause if you have issues union will fight for you
good,"As  temporary employee your job position is not secure. You are not assigned to any specific job and you can be moved at any time. Sometimes, you are moved off a job with no other work available."
good,"GM has many job options available with a myriad of choices . The career is what you make of it . The pay and benefits are competitive."
good,"At the team level, things are pretty good. You do have the gigantic monolithic company that is GM above that, though. Executives can sometimes feel out of touch with the regular employees, but that doesn't ever really affect you. You can move around within the company pretty easily, so you can find something that suits you if you don't feel fulfilled in your role. If you want a high range of vertical movement, this isn't the place, it's good for developing your skills, and moving laterally. College-hire program is awesome, and you'll meet a lot of new, young faces. Some of the old-GM is still here, but you can see the bright spots where it's improving."
good,"Fast past environment with a high degree of learning done on the job and out of necessity. They need to improve training resources, but for the most part opportunities for learning can be found during the daily job activities."
good,"General Motors provides a good living for those who are employed with them, as a manager there are many roles that I play in the company from running my line of 40 people and their payroll to making sure my employees are train right on jobs and safety."
good,"Good Company to work for needs to work on getting the ones who have been working for 50 years out, Really needs to figure out a steady pay scale, Management needs a lot of work."
good,buen lugar de trabajo. para desarrollar tus habilidades y seguir aprendiendo.
good,"GM SA was a good company I have learnt a lot from them, they have a good mentorship and good trainings for young engineers. it gave me a lot of chances to showcase my career."
good,"El ambiente se vuelve pesado, muy poco crecimiento laboral, pocas categorías y cero tiempo extra."
good,Buen ambiente laboral pésima administración y no se toma en cuenta la seguridad para nada
good,The pay and benefits are much better than average. The working conditions vary greatly on job assignment and location. The management likewise can vary from poor and antagonistic to caring and good leadership.
good,GM was a very stressful position but the work was most rewarding.  It taught us how the automotive industry works.  Promotions were available provided you were a performer.  Lots of OT and little regard for your family life.
good,"General Motors Company is an American multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, markets, and distributes vehicles and vehicle parts, and sells financial services. GM manufactures cars and trucks in 35 countries. In 2008, 8.35 million GM cars and trucks were sold globally under various brands."
good,The pay was decent. They some people treated others with out respect  but over all not to bad. I was a temp for 1.5 Year's and then got laid off. They may or may not call us back
good,"A typical day at work for me; fast phase picking up phone calls and chat and also multiple tasks, such as remote into three different user's pc to install application or doing fix and resolved the issue eithers incoming calls or chat. however when during the slow time each analyst can access GM leaning library and study the new app and procedure. our team lead are good at supporting the employees. Also our workplaces cultures are multiple cultures we have Korean, Spanish and German, Thai. one big happy family. but hard part of job is working in when support page does not have the correct informations about the procedure or policy to resolve the issue 3rd shift and drive 2 hours each day.lastly I enjoy resolving the issue for the GM user so that they can continue to work without having any issue with application for GM production."
good,General Motors was an interesting place to work at because of the mix of union and non-union employees that occasionally led to conflicts with the union supervisor and upper management. Overall good place to work.
good,"It felt as a small university. 3000 employees and you learn a lot."
good,As a contract employee it is complicated to review since you are on the outside looking in. Still a good place to work at.  Flex time is a nice perk...
good,The size of this company allows you to get involved in many aspects of the business. You have the opportunity to gain breadth and depth in the scope of the entire automotive business
good,It was a fast paced environment and stressful place to work but it paid my bills. I just know I can do more in the medical field and make myself feel better knowing what I’m doing everyday it to help or save someone’s life
good,"Strange Manager"
good,"Experiencia que permite poner a prueba la capacidad de resiliencia y agilidad para tomar muchos temas y tenerlos resueltos y respuestas a cada uno en cualquier momento. "
good,"Multinacional com ótimas oportunidades de conhecimento e ótimas pessoas para se trabalhar."
good,You could have as much overtime as wanted. Learned a new job at least once a week. Management was very focused and professional. Co-workers we're very nice and supportive. The hardest part are the job is the LAYOFFS. I'm young and looking to work not sit at home. I enjoyed the co-workers and the management.
good,"very busy all day , working with a big team to deliver projects in timely manner. Very big car culture, hardest part of job working long hours. Enjoyable was the finished project."
good,Great place to work. Just sick of mandatory overtime for 9 years. Not enough time away from work. I have a young child that I never see because of working shift work and mandatory overtime.
good,"Great place to work, great Management and great union. Very fair and so much pride into the vehicles that are produced. Great Management that care about the people and the quality."
good,Management is terrible and are against you most of the time even if something is their fault and you have the proof.  They ignore their own safety precautions in order to have quantity over quality.
good,"GM does a great job with salary, bonus, and benefits.  IT is still transforming and figuring out how to work as a unit.  Each team is very different - some are moving fast while others are simply working on the same tech from 20 years ago."
good,I enjoyed my time at GMAM. Management is supportive. It is a fast paced and stressful place to work.It is  time to move on to new challenges and new career opportunities.
good,Great company for learning about the automotive industry and development. A lot of training opportunities.
good,"Muy buen ambiente laboral, con una cultura de trabajo en equipo"
good,"Everyday I enjoyed coming into GM and seeing the people I worked with and getting my work area prepared for my work shift. I was fortunate that I learned many jobs in my area of the Trim Dept. Being on a busy, fast paced job was my favorite part of the time I spent at General Motors though."
good,The culture in my department  was to focus on analysts and advance them regularly.  It was a good training ground atmosphere.  The management was generally grateful for the support provided and wanted their team to be successful. It was somewhat stressful because of the high visibility within the organization.  I enjoyed meeting/greeting/escorting visitors.  That interaction in addition to new staff was what I enjoyed the most.
good,This was easily the most fast paced environment I have seen. It was a fun challenge that ended with my contract running out. There is  many Saturdays you must work as well as three shifts.
good,I learned a variety of jobs starting in the paint shop and in general assembly. Its fast pace which I enjoy. It makes the day go by fast. The majority of the people there are nice to work with. They become a part of your family. The amount of hours you could work and the money you could make was great but the job didn't last.
good,I worked for GM for over 30 years and then retired. It was your typical warehouse position on the assembly line. Hard work with descent compensation and union support.
good,"I enjoyed my time at General Motors,no job is to hard you just have to be willing to learn the jobs,i learned to work with alot of different people alot of different attitudes you just mind your business and do your job,if you have a problem go to your supervisor and let them handle any problem with another worker they are good about that,the hardest part of the job is not knowing if you are going home at 10;30pm on Friday,the most enjoyable part of the job is just doing your job to hit the numbers for cars"
good,"Seems to be hard for me personally to get internal jobs outside of my department.  I have recently completed my masters degree thinking this would help.  I see people that switch jobs but I have not had any luck.  I have applied for over 400 positions in 5 years with no luck.  Guess I should just sit in the same spot and be happy."
good,Upgrade products as the business requires them. . Bring changes through CAB meetings and explain the impact it may have on a business. some weekend work.
good,Overall great place to work and the benefits are great. Great place to grow and expand if cats are selling. The fellow employees are very welcoming and eager to teach new employees.
good,Needs lots of work to much time spent on repetitive work and not alowining enrollment.          of  people a the knowledge they have.To much micro management
good,Great company to work for when the auto industry is booming. During cyclical periods a scary place to work for as job security is scarce for low seniority.
good,As a line supervisor you must have a personality and be able to communicate properly with fellow members of management and union. If you can do this and have thick enough skin to work in a union shop and like a fast pace work day then this job would work for you.
good,"fast paced, learned to be a team player, when everyone works together the smoother things go. everyone gets along like a family. some jobs are very challenging."
good,I loved the opportunity to work at Gm but the downfall was a temporary worker and union did nothing for us. Made decent money and worked a lot of mandatory overtime.
good,"O dia trabalho era puxado, mas nada que não fosse resolvido."
good,All in all it was a good job. Long hours and the lack of flexibility made it difficult to maintain a life outside of the company. Benefits were fairly decent. Between the lay offs and shut downs if you don't plan financially for them it could be a hassle.
good,"Empresa multinacional no Ramo de Engenharia voltada para projetos de carros Chevrolet....Algumas Lideranças incompetente, apontando uma falta de análise da Gerência neste quesito..Ex. Supervisor de área com 4º série do ensino fundamental totalmente despreparado e incompetente para a função de mais de 90 pessoas a maioria delas graduadas, trazendo com isso grandes transtornos como por exemplo assédio moral e discriminação racial."
good,"Os funcionários mais antigos puderam provar da grande empresa que foi a GM, nos dias atuais é como todas as outras."
good,"Good job, good environment with friendly staff. The place is well maintained and is in good shape. The place needs better cafeterias and food corner for all the employers."
good,I waited for this opportunity all my life. I finally got in and GM could not keep me working long enough to get a permanent position. Therefore the dream of working for the auto industry (GM) is crushed. as i have to start over with the hiring process and hope i land a spot.
good,"Pre recession, GM was a great atmosphere to work in.  Teams were very supportive and management was as well.  Unfortunately, the recession caused many contractors to be laid off."
good,"Pay is great but you will earn it, benefits are amazing.  6 day work weeks.  Internal temp not properly maintained.  Some jobs are extremely difficult"
good,I was displaced/early retirement as a result of the bankruptcy. I had a wonderful experience with the company prior to that event. I was promoted from a vehicle platform warranty reduction lead to the staff assistant position in the technical assistance call center mainly due to a manager that was sensitive to my desire to minimize my daily commute.
good,"All the upbeat hope I was forces to endure about the ""new GM"" was nonsense with all the old managers and leadership still pulling all the strings. 100 year old business practices- they don't learn from mistakes and are willing to spend money on ""experimental"" departments without regard to ROI. Okay job, unrealistic expectations from management."
good,em 6 anos tive grandes experiencias e um otimo aprendizado.
good,"La jornada laboral es de 8 horas en dos turnos."
good,"A empresa possui muitas novidades no dia a dia de trabalho e facilidade para transição de área internamente. O ambiente é tranquilo e os funcionários são bons profissionais. A parte difícil do trabalho é conseguir acompanhar um projeto do início ao fim, pois envolve muitas pessoas e áreas."
good,The best part about the job was a cordial culture. I learned how to work even in the adverse conditions such as system failures etc.
good,"Start the day doing the same thing over and over again.  But with time and seniority you  can move onto other jobs.  I have learned how to solve issues through Red X.  I have learned that working together, goals can be achieved.  Management on a whole is pretty good. Depending on your supervisor.  Co-workers are mostly friendly and are enjoyable as well. The hardest part of the job is the repetitiveness and the shift work.   I have enjoyed working with the co-workers, moving on to different jobs.  Working with Red X was great.  Learning how to problem solve and working with management, engineers, vendors and assemblers."
good,"As promoções seguem as diretrizes da direção, não por merecimento."
good,"I enjoyed working here. The people are always hands on. They know their work. I got a chance to work with a lot of disadvantaged pupils in public primary schools. The work the foundation put in, made a significant difference in the pupils lives."
good,"good work environment I started my carrier in this company with minimal knowledge, I have learnt lot.co workers are friendly and knowledge sharing"
good,Difficult to get through all the bureaucracy to make a transaction. Mulit-level approvals were too timely and lost major transactions as  not able to act quick it there was a competing property.
good,"Best working experience in gm"
good,"The work-life balance as a supplier quality engineer and for design release is nonexistent.  It's exciting and you will create a large, varied network both within and out of GM.  However, you will often find yourself working on your own time, bringing your laptop with you on vacation and travelling on personal time."
good,"Hard to become GM employee without commiting to moving every 18months."
good,"General Motors is a good place to start for young, educated people.  It is globally diverse with internationally openings.  There is rapid cultural transformation going on creating an environment with ripe with opportunities to learn about our global neighbors."
good,"In the time period involved at GM, I enjoyed learning processes that I can ultimately are used in the industry elsewhere."
good,Great for Work Life Balance but questionable for career advancement since the review process is not fair and preference is given to employees who has spent more times v/s better performance.
good,"You're just a number but the Pay more than makes up for it.."
good,I love my job but now i want to pursue my career more so that i can got more experience.I started my journey as a receptionist and then i become Crm due to my hard work and honesty.
good,Lot of opportunities to learn.Over all good work culture. Opportunities to grow not satisfactory. Opportunity to work for different global regions.
good,Really enjoyed working there. Working on a Lean Six Sigma Process was very rewarding. It inspired me to become a Certified Six Sigma Greenbelt..
good,"boa empresa...para si trabalhar...tanto como parte de segurança com trabalhador,com muito respeito ao seus clientes..."
good,"Boa empresa para trabalhar, porém, acho que ainda tem muito para evoluir na área de TI."
good,"The work load was never ending.  Taking over for another engineer, cleaning up existing projects were exciting and overwhelming.  I was given free range over my projects and had the opportunity to further other initiatives."
good,"Best job I've ever had, room for advancement is limited. Management is not what it should be, at least out of my department. Overall the company is amazing, they care about the employees."
good,Great company to work for. Hard to get hired. Also very hard to get promoted upwards. Negotiate the position you really want up front as it will become very difficult to advance once you start the role.
good,"Long hours, highly demanding work environment, migration to a new mainframe platform in a very short term to avoid losing vendor support."
good,There were many employees that were excited to work for one of the biggest automotive manufacturers in the world. There were also many employees that were content to performing at the minimum level. It was a fun place to work and see the newest cars come out of into production.  There were a lot of great challenges and exciting programs to work on.
good,A very rich experience working as a change agent in the production department and reach BIQ level III through enforcing the quality & standardization culture within the working team.
good,It is a very good place to work but if you are looking for an opportunity for advancement then you are going to have to a little help from someone that you know.
good,"For being a student, GM is a great place to be working. The pay is great, jobs aren't too physically demanding, but there is a pretty steep learning curve the first day or two."
good,This is probably the best job a recent graduate can have. Great company with a outstanding culture. Work with some of the most knowledgeble people in the industry on projects. The company have a very good support system too. The only thing negative is that This is a position that won't take you anywhere. It is a dead end position. If you run into a supervisor that doesn't support your growth then this is really just a position where you learn your basics and build a strong foundation and look for something else or you won't go anywhere with your future.
good,A large company with all the benefits and opportunities for the right person. Not worked there for over 10 years so a little difficult to comment.
good,"The best working enviorment with supportive co-workers. Learning somthing new everyday. Management at its best. The hardest part of the job is shift timings."
good,"I currently love my job and position with GM."
good,"Empresa que se preocupa com a formação do colaborador, oferece cursos e bolsa auxilio para formação superior."
good,"During my stay at General Motors of Canada, I discovered the following:"
good,"Empresa com diversos ótimos profissionais. Isso gera um grande aprendizado profissional, principalmente no gerenciamento de diversas atividades importante ao mesmo tempo. Como é uma empresa de diversos níveis de hierarquia, acaba reportando para diversas áreas, o que gera a necessidade de uma postura muito profissional para atender a expectativa de diversas áreas."
good,"General Motors is a very large place to work and even though change is evident with the new CEO, it is still very slow to ocurr even after bankruptcy."
good,GM is my best working experience. The major challenge has been manage the legacy problem that they have with all retired peopleand UAW
good,"boa, multinacional com bom suporte para o trabalhador em todos os sentidos com foco e objetivos determinados e com credenciais para dar um suporte adequado para que os funcionarios se desenvolvam no dia a dia"
good,"Empresa muito dinâmica, necessitando movimentação por toda planta, porem pouca garantia de emprego pois todo ano te greve e demissões."
good,"Although I was working only as an intern in engineering, the company had a pretty good culture. You work with your teammates daily and I don't think there is an option to work from home ever. Everyone seemed knowledgeable and had a good mix of work hard/play hard."
good,"The company is very diverse in culture.  The hours are flexible.  The company is stable, most employees have been there for 20+ years."
good,good job raise a family . At the time General Motors was the largest car company in the world. They were world leaders in manufacturing processes. At the time the sewing departments were producing large volumes per day of finished back seats for Oldsmobile and Chevy automobiles.
good,"Empresa muito boa, porem rígida com os funcionários em relação a produtividade."
good,"I absolutely loved working for GM and was very disappointed when the plant I worked at closed down. "
good,The jobs themselves are not too difficult to learn nor do. Not a whole lot of room for advancement. Everything is based on seniority so it does not really matter too much how you preform the job. This is quite discouraging in the job itself as it promotes an average or slightly below average work habit. I wish there was some sort of challenge motivating you to do your absolute best. The benefits are the best I have seen anywhere.
good,"Elaboração de formulários on-line na plataforma google-drive."
good,"Uma excelente empresa para trabalhar. Como não tem profissionais qualificados para ocupar cargos de supervisão, fica um pouco desgastante o trabalho, pois não sabem orientar o time a trabalhar com prazer, fazem muita ameaça sem fundamento e não estão preparados a dirigir uma equipe de trabalho. Isso acontece pelo fato de não estarem preparados e conseguirem a função por indicação de amigos que estão na gerência. Mas a empresa num todo em relação ao relacionamento entre os colegas de trabalho é muito bom."
good,Only there for short duration. Typical work at a auto factory.  No complaints.
good,Lot of exiciting projects in light weight of autombiles. Growth opportunities are limited.
good,"Administrative work most of the day. Good database development "
good,"I enjoy working at GM;"
good,Os profissionais da área são bem unidos sempre a disposto a ajudar quando for necessário era um ambiente bem agradável.
good,"learn new skill"
good,"worked on varies jobs on the assembly line, some easy and some hard."
good,"Aprendi muitas coisas como: trabalho em equipe, padronização, busca constante pela qualidade."
good,"I worked manily in the overpack area which is the small parts of the plant such as keys, bulbs, starters, flywheels etc... the day started with a group meeting letting us know how heavy or light the day would be, then we would get to it with scanning our tickets and picking the correct parts, we had a parts per hour we had to keep i would ususally be well above the number.  I also was in bulk the heavy parts such as hoods, side paneling, wheel rims etc... Also was on the dock where when parts or the truck was done and all parts were id load it up"
good,To be a part of such a big organization was truly a blessing. Would have liked to finish my career there.
good,Very productive company for the TIBCO developers at Zensar technologies.
good,"Incentivadora do trabalho em equipe, agir como uma unica empresa, proporcionava um canal aberto entre operadores e a liderança, apoiadora quando o assunto era formação acadêmica ou pós graduação."
good,"Worked here for 8 years started from the bottom  to a GM,learned a lot from this job and this is where i learned my management skills."
good,"A typical day at work involves inspecting parts as they come out of a press and making sure there are no defects. I learned how to inspect these parts, load them and tag the contains properly. I also learned how to repair some of these parts. Management here is good, however, they don't always follow though with what they advise they will follow through with. My co-workers were like my family. We all looked out for the well being of each other. The hardest part of the job was the tedious work, making sure every part is up to standards, and the labor aspect of the job. The most enjoy part of the job was leaving everyday knowing that I caught a bad part and I was able to remove it from production before it made it any further."
good,"My job pays well. However there is no room for advancement. I have completed my education with hopes of moving up into the management side of operations. The work at my job is repititve movement and it's automatic. If you're looking for a way to provide for your family, then this place is amazing, but if you're on the constant hunger for challenge then it isn't."
good,Stable work with good pay.  Overall a good work enviorment.  Extremely competitive
good,"A typical day at work is ever changing, a highly dynamic busy enviroment with a key focus on delivering on business results."
good,Um dos pontos fortes é o ambiente de trabalho e também a possibilidade de job rotations em outros departamentos. Por outro lado é muito difícil assumir um cargo de liderança mesmo com feedbacks positivos.
good,Empresa comprometida em 1º lugar com a segurança e bem estar do funcionário.
good,"GM was an excellent place to achieve whatever it was you wanted to achieve, in that they had programs in place where you could enhance your resume by going back to school, and therefore increase your chances for a better paying position, or just move on to something else other than work for GM. These programs were largely in place because of the efforts of both GM and the Union."
good,"GM was a good place to learn, but I wanted to learn more and at the time it seemed like I wasn't learning things that I wanted to advance in my career."
good,General Motors is a great company to work for prior to their financial issues. I grew up in GM and always loved it. Working for the Parts Plant and helping all of the dealerships in Southern California was very busy and productive for me. I enjoyed keeping busy and helping the dealers.
good,"Working in GM is very challenging as well as satisfactory from the achievement point of view. I have learned so many new things in terms of technical, management skills and which will be the big asset for my future career. Most which I have enjoyed here is the affectionate and friendly interaction from my co-workers. So at last very thankful for giving me opportunity to serve for this esteemed global organisation.Still I am enjoying my service with GM as well as learning every moment."
good,"Grande concorrência interna, empresa que busca primeiro lugar no mercado."
good,"learned to operate many machines, worked with many great people"
good,aprende coisas novas
good,a typical day at work:
good,"Es un poco incomodo al no contar con un espacio privado definido para la realizacio de las labores en su maxima capacidad, siempre es dicifil tener la privacidad necesaria para establecer mejoras."
good,"Empresa em crescimento no mercado, se moldando nos periféricos administrativos de uma média empresa,"
good,This plant was closed in 2008. This job offered great wages and benefits.
good,A typical day at this job was working on machines.
good,Direct client support of Truck Product Center Purchasing department.
good,"Empresa boa de remuneração,porem muito atrasada no aspecto ético corporacional,tem uma cultura muito antiga de trabalho,o que já não se comporta mais num mundo tão dinâmico e competitivo que temos hoje."
good,"I'd start with good-morning,cup of coffee;reading job instructions on inspection work. I learnt to identify certain parts an what an how to look for that erro. supervision is organized an balanced. The hardest part: not prepared for overtime. enjoyable:working full time,overtime,getting paid; last but not least,learning different skills."
good,Interaction with people
good,General Motors is a 100 yr old US automobile giant.
good,"Trabalhar em um linha de montagem não é fácil, tem que ter muita opinião e muito cuidado com seu corpo(ergonomia), sempre estar policiando sua postura, mas é um bom lugar para se trabalhar."
good,Great place to work in the fast -paced Automotive Manufacturing environment. Great place to learn new technologies & implement projects to assist with meeting overall company goals.
good,Would have stayed longer if the plant hadn't closed down. Good training. Jobs were challenging but the pay was worth the effort. Lots of job variety. Not a lot of room for advancement.
good,"Good place to work. You can Able to Use and learn  latest technology. Good benefits.  "
good,Working at general motors is fun in that you get to see how cars are made form start to finish and be a part of the process. The employees are the worst part because there is no interview process. Essentially anyone can get in and it shows.
good,"I got to work all areas of the plant over the years( I worked as a temp/summer help for 6 years before I got hired), and all shifts- doing dozens of different jobs, working and meeting hundreds of people over the years- made it very interesting and a great learning experience. I also got to make several cars while their-  that was great."
good,"Quarterly bonuses are a plus however, hourly pay should and could be more. For some reason, it is difficult to move around to other depts which your work performance should determine that but it doesn’t in many cases. Great work-life balance as well depending on your TL."
good,"The people at General Motors are top notch. Very professional to work with. "
good,"For the older worker that has more than 15 years at GM I would be nervous as the trend is to remove them and replace them with new college grads.  My group was eliminated  because it was core to building vehicles but was still needed,  So instead of offering us other opportunities the let us go.  Yes I'm salary.  Very disappointed as this is the company I always wanted to work for.  Now I'm back as a part time group leader with no benefits or vacation.  Its very hard to find full time work now that I'm not of college age.  No one wants to touch a former auto worker.  Sad . . ."
good,The people in charge at the top have no respect for the people at the lower level the pay is good and the work is fun to do  the people are good to work with and the benefits are good . Not a bad company just a few people make it hard.
good,.O ambiente é agradável. Possuem benefícios como transporte e refeitório.
good,"Dependent on the type of manufacturing operations plant or support center building you are assigned to for employment w/ GM that could almost make or break your daily love or dismay you feel going into the workplace. Again, there are always opportunities to relocate or apply for numerous other internal hiring positions within the company on the career portal website."
good,Great benefits/salary/401K. Great place for growth within the company and its suppliers. Also great work environment and family type atmosphere among employees.
good,Some jobs are better than others but the pay is good! If you can get lucky enough to be hired then accept any position offered to get your foot in the door.
good,"There was a lot of transitioning in the applications when I was there.  Commitments done to executives compressed the time for doing the work, and exacerbated by slow responsiveness of the other teams."
good,"Before disinvestment of GMSA to America;  I enjoyed the diversity and challenges every new day brought. I enjoyed dealing with the dealer network and their staff as this often challenged my own thinking and taught me to think on my feet. GMSA taught me to plan my day, deal with pressures from clients and Head office alike and to task myself with goals that needed to be achieved for the day, week, month etc. The culture of being firm but fair helped me to foster meaningful relationships with key stakeholders."
good,Coordinate with managers of possible ways to improve company productivity as well as increase employee morale. Benefits are explored to make sure that employees can use them to the full potential
good,Empresa Intensa e ambiente muito agradável para se trabalhar.
good,"I was very blessed to work at the Flint assembly plant. My supervisor is very understanding and works with us to ensure a good working environment. Employees are easy to work with as a team, and the culture is amazing."
good,Good place to work. Great benefits.  Lots of standing in the work is very repetitive. Building is very clean. Lot of good hard-working people. Ergonomically adapted and safe.
good,"Fast Pace, and stressful. It was very challenging, and I enjoyed it.  The downside was work life Balance,  Had I been a few years younger (and not married with kids) it would have been the Perfect job.  It's a shame the Manufacturing plant is now closed."
good,"Really enjoyed working here. I worked 3 days a week 8 hours a day. I worked with GM retirees and a supervisor to focus on projects that would make our city more safe, clean and interesting to residents. the best summer internship ever. The even paid for lunch everyday"
good,"There is no coffee provided but other benefits are good."
good,Lots of good people but to be taken seriously  and for career prospects you need to be based in USA. Huge strides ahead in product range now very competative
good,There is never much certainty to know if your job is always secure on a yearly basis. I was a contract employee was always treated fairly. Other coworkers were always supportive.
good,Worked with a great group of people till they shut the doors. Had a wonder supervisor and great team to work with. Almost like a second family. Nothing last forever
good,General Motors Assembly is a great place to work for.  Great Benefits and jobs that are not too hard.  Team work is important to meet customers demands.
good,Working at GM was one of the best jobs I have had. Working in a Union Shop was a new experience and it provided several perks that I had never had in previous jobs. I am grateful that I had the time at GM and at times wish I had stayed!!
good,"Work at GM includes many meetings a day. The culture is flexible, the management I dealt with was very good. "
good,"Management was available but did not micromanage the work time."
good,"Most of the projects that are in flight are to replace the older technology that GM has operated under for the last 20 years."
good,GM IT organization has no leadership. Most projects were mismanaged and the focus was on delivery regardless of the quality of the product.   So the support became very difficult.
good,There is never a dull moment within this factory environment.  You will be amazed from what you see and hear on a daily bases.  But overall good company and great people.
good,"Very challenging workplace, need to have a diverse skill set to stay valuable .I find that the job requires an equal amount of technical skill and administrative skill."
good,Good pay and benefits.  Lots of hours eat up your week monday - friday.  Weekends optional.  Great benefits.  The work is easy but the work standards are difficult to maintain.
good,"Like any company your experience at General Motors will vary greatly. It is truly dependent on your job function, the people you work with and the boss you have. Luckily it is easier to move within GM now as opposed to 15 years ago where it was as difficult as finding a job at a new company. There is more support and direction given to new hires than when I started. Like anything though you have to consider what is good for you and your family rather than letting a job predicate your needs."
good,"Enjoyed working at GM, Except i dont like the way they treates the employees when the lay off happens. "
good,deixou de ser uma empresa com estabilidade de emprego para uma empresa de regime de contrato temporário com redução de salário

good,"Must be able to learn quickly and manage at a fast pace, stand long hours and bare with repetitive movements. Lots of Hours offered everyday, No problems as long as you do your job."
good,I enjoyed working at GM but personal feelings of the company obscure the overall score. I wish things would have been better and that I would have been able to stay.
good,"I spent most of my career at GM and worked with some great managers and some no so good managers.  I was not able to advance in the early days of my career.  I had to prove my value over and over before I was promoted.  Overall, great place to work, but I don't think GM values their employees like the should."
good,"General Motors is still going through growing pains in trying to be a modern company. IT is encouraged to innovate, innovate, innovate, yet the business partners making the calls have all been around 15+ years and want to keep everything the way it has always been. From these same people, there is a lack of respect for the IT profession and qualifications/skills such as User Experience or following modern web standards and best practices. The IT management, especially at the director level, is either spineless or organizationally powerless to push back against the bad ideas or support the good ideas on behalf of the teams they manage. It is probably a little of both. This regularly leads to conflicting agendas. IT is supposed to be cutting edge and think outside the box, but they're not allocated any capacity or time to do basic maintenance, upgrades, and idea time. Capacity and resources are completely allocated to business objectives until your application crashes or has a security breach; then time can allocated on maintenance."
good,"Excellent environment to work, where you can learn a lot of things related to vehicle systems and new technologies."
good,i have learnt the ethics that are followed in the job environment and have given my 100% to the company. My day starts with a meeting on what i have already done and what i am going to do.

good,"Process engineering work orders, produce technical documentation and support production assemblies. "
good,"It is good company to work for. Human resources need to do better job in investigating the incidents between managers and their employees, based on the evidence, than to take word for from the managers and take their side. They need to take a quick action against the responsible party, not to wait for years for job cuts."
good,"The culture changes depending on department. Many of the offices have adopted the 'open environment' which everyone hates. Everyone is out for themselves, don't be naive."
good,"Sometime, I have to stay late to troubleshoot robots but that was a reasonable because a production line. I did have a good team and good manager to work with."
good,"Busy fast paced."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the amazing people I worked with.  My direct supervisors were very friendly and understanding. A typical day at work was challenging as each day required different skill sets and knowledge.
good,"Busy all the time things needed to be moved from the time you came in, things had to be trashed , taken outside, or just put in another location. Trucks also came in and had to be unloaded or cars needed to be shipped out. Reviews went on daily that need to be set up for and taken down, cars had to be brought in for the reviews, and sometimes washed, cleaned. I learned that you can only get done what you can get done in one day and most where ok with that. The most enjoyably part of my job was everyone that I had the chance to work."
good,"Great place to work. Work life balance is very good. Learned a lot of new skills. It would be good to adopt a new version quickly."

good,Worked on the assembly line aligning car hoods and latches. Not much contact with management. I Iearned to work with a partner and a team. The hardest part of the job was doing the same thing on every car.
good,I've grown a lot working at General Motors.  Their benefits and company mission makes it a top company to work for. The training and experience helps you develop skills to run your own company.
good,"GM is transforming itself into a cutting edge Automotive Company.  It is becoming a tech company that sells cars!.  The culture is fun, competitive and keeps it's employees informed."
good,The management team need to learn how to position the new hire. They should give them more challenge work instead of just copying and pasting all the day. Great team environment and nice Work life balance tho.

good,"The workplace had a relaxed vibe to it. My role did get more busy whenever a new major issue popped up, which was quite often in the last 7 months. My colleagues were very approachable and helpful when I needed them. Lunch with the team was always fun. I learned a lot, not only in developing my software skills, but also with my management.

good,siempre hay cosas nuevas por aprender y retos por superar.
good,"A typical day at work is putting out technical fires on the phone and ensuring end users that you are working on their issue as promptly as possible to get them back in business mode. I had opportunity to learn about various General Motors business apps, various techniques to resolve technical issues and to implement workarounds for temporary solutions. The position affords you to gain a great deal of knowledge about the manufacturing business as well as interfacing with the vendors and suppliers. The workplace culture is amazing, being able to work so closely with so many people on so many levels, backgrounds and countries is amazing. The hardest part about the job is sitting for long periods and developing the ability to not let people push your button.  The most enjoyable part is when you get a customer who really appreciates your hard work."
good,"You have to be on point working here.You must have a fast mind set"
good,"GM India , Bangalore office is a nice place to be working with a very people friendly culture.

good,"General Motors is a good Company to work for,  although we (the Contract people) were under the understanding that we would get hired as a General Motors employee which never happened.  Then when we had a down turn, our jobs (Contract workers) were replaced by General Motors Employees."

good,"Fantastic place if you are just getting started in your career, depending on organization you are in.  Some really dedicated, brilliant people.that work there that will go above and beyond to help you grow and learn.  Upper management are too quick to make short term band aid fixes without thinking them through."
good,"While the work was very tough and management can sometimes be tough to deal with when things go wrong, overall it is a pretty positive work environment. If you are a hard worker you will do well. Workers stick together and there is a very high amount of teamwork that goes on. Everyone helps each other out and stands united. The people are what make the job so amazing. If you want a job that comes with a work family this is a great place to work."
good,"Great place to work, but need to move faster. Leadership wants you to do 15 years of jobs before you can be considered for leadership positions. Most leadership is slow to adopt anything new."
good,the great thing about GM is you continually learn throughout the course of your career and there are typically plenty of opportunities for advancement.

good,"The day was interesting and I enjoyed seeing the product built, the red tape the management hard to go through to work with the union was difficult.

I see the various tasks and how every department connected with each other. I dare to do things I would normally not do such as leading meetings with customers and representing the company in a network meeting. However, I noticed that I worker overtime and do a lot of preparation in advance, It was intense to do it all but I am thankful for this opportunity."
good,"Nice place to work.  Nice benefits.  Stressful work life.  Management in my department got away with a lot of unfair treatment of several employees, including, promotion of friends over qualified applicants, forced transition of employees to new teams, under compensation, taking credit for others' work product and even firing of good team members.  It was really bad for morale. Everyone scared for their jobs."
good,"I worked in the paint shops 80% of the time, and was able to learn every job. Wasn't enough to not get laid off just before Thanksgiving. It was a mass of lay-offs and it was something to do with bringing everyone back under a new ""flex-temp"" hire (Saturdays only, after being laid-off for three months.) Good job, but I moved on by time they got everything together. The thing that made me give up on GM is the fact that I've worked over a few hundred days, but they found a way to lay me off before I could get hired in three different times. Hired as ""temp"" need 90 days to be hired in."

O Engenheiro de Produto atua praticamente como um Gerente de Projetos, responsável não só pela realização técnica do Projeto, mas tb pelo cronograma do mesmo. Por isso, aprendi muito sobre rotinas das áreas de Compras, Qualidade, Manufatura, além de interagir e negociar prazos com todos estes departamentos. O ambiente de trabalho era bastante agradável. A parte mais difícil do trabalho era a burocracia.

Scrambling to get the job done before you have to start the next one."

good,"GM-IT is a huge operation in Austin, Texas. In saying that everyone is very friendly and happy to help new hires. Work distribution varies greatly by team. Some employees or new hires have it easy with little workloads, while others feel continually swamped.

good,"A typical day at GM as a design release engineer assistant is pretty easy. The amount of work they give you really makes the day go by really quick. People that I reported to are friendly and are always willing to help you with anything. I especially enjoyed learning about cars and driving them too. I learned a lot of data entry programs and a lot about cars. There are a lot of flaws with management because the design release engineer assistant role is new but they make sure that everyone has something to do so that our time is utilized properly. The hardest part of my job at GM was the work load. I had to report to 4 teams and each team had 10-15 people so the amount of work that they requested of me was a lot but again it made the day go by really fast. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to see the ""behind the scenes"" things of their cars before the general public. Another enjoyable part of my job was being able to drive all the cars."
good,Working with a team that wants you to learn so that issues can be fully resolved in a faster manner. Management is very fair when dealing with both work and home. Co-workers will talk with you if you are approachable. Hardest part of working downtown is dealing with your parking conditions. Enjoyed working with GM/OnStar associates.
good,The internship provided me with a great deal of flexibility in my schedule however I worked almost every weekend. My boss was incredible and I really enjoyed working for him. I was privileged to have exposure and given experience to nearly every department within the plant and created projects and assisted almost all of them.
good,"Company that showed me how to assemble a vehicle.  Got a chance to see how all departments have to come together.  Sometimes, the company rewarded the employees with bonuses.  You got a chance to do any job that you wanted to because it had so many opportunities."
good,Excellent company for the most part until the economy started going bad.  Systems were by far the best that I have ever worked with in my professional career.

good,"Trabalhava com acompanhamento das obras que estavam em execução, as quais éramos responsáveis, tanto por parte dos projetos, como pelo resultado final."
good,"O dia de trabalho normalmente se iniciava com a colocação dos EPIs pois não era permitido engraçar na linha sem os mesmos, apos iniciávamos a produção diária o acompanhamento do processo era realizada pelos lideres o processo em si não possuía etapas difíceis o convívio com diversas pessoas me proporcionou muito aprendizado pois as relações pessoais são sempre importantes para o bom andamento do trabalho no grande grupo."
good,"Reunião diária com o time de logística para avaliar situações que implicariam riscos nos processos de logística ou parada de linha de produção.Avaliação dos serviços realizados pelos provedores contratados e eventuais ações à serem tomadas. Conference call com as empresas contratadas para corrigir e identificar divergências nas operações. Suporte aos clientes internos para evitar desabastecimento nas linhas de montagem, realizar manobras para driblar problemas externos não controláveis, por exemplo, greve de motoristas, alagamentos, quebra de veículos, acidentes e outros. Avaliação de KPI das empresas contratadas para determinação de procedimentos para melhoria nos resultados. Participação em reuniões diárias sobre segurança. Visita aos provedores logísticos, check list em veículos contratados. Aprendi a conviver em uma empresa com um processo extremamente complexo e ao mesmo tempo fascinante de produção, me ajudou a conhecer novas atividades e novos horizontes. Trabalhei cerca de um ano e meio com o último gerente, sua experiência de trabalho era voltada para Compras, acredito que o auxiliei na transição para a área de Logística. Parte difícil do trabalho era lidar com a burocracia em alguns processos, porém entendo que é uma característica do ramo de uma empresa com cerca de 20.000 funcionários no Brasil. Parte agradável era realizar as tarefas de modo rápido e eficiente."
good,It will be an flexible timing for employees to work here and there is no partiality between Suppliers and employees.Self learning is only option. Management looks for more from the resource apart from regular work.C-workers are supportive and team building is good.The Hardest part of the job needs an Alignment with the global region counterparts for meeting and issue resolution.The most enjoyable part of the job will be freedom for you to work and explore the new opportunities.
good,"Excelente empresa."
good,"Over the course of two years at General Motors Component Holdings LLC., my coworkers became like a second family to me. On a day to day basis, it was a very comfortable and fairly stress free environment. On my maternity leave, I was mailed a congratulations card with all my coworkers signatures, and someone even took the time to knit a baby blanket for my son."
good,Lacked Job Security but excellent room for advancement.. And excellent benefit package. Education opportunities were great because it affords you a chance to reinvent yourself when you are laid off. Only setback is being laid off. otherwise great company to work for.
good,"Em função do tamanho da empresa, possue muitas areas de  atividade, incluindo aquelas não relacionadas como ramo produtivo."
good,"General Motors do Brasil é uma empresa que oferece benefícios e remuneração atrativas aos olhos de um funcionário que procura estabilidade e segurança, onde colegas, gerência atuam juntos, na resolução de problemas, no treinamento de novos membros, dando a todos os mesmos tratamento ."
good,"Being on time and Attendance was very important. the line started at the top of the hour beginning each shift rather your at your station or not. I learned to use a bunch of different power tools, read manifest and 6 months after working there I was put into the ""pool"" where I was responsible for Relieving workers and replace anyone that would miss days. Management was very distant but handled a comfortable workplace. Co-workers was very welcoming. Hardest thing about the job was Keeping up with the line until you get the hang of things. I loved the wages and scheduling."
good,"I do love working for GM, I love the people I work with, and I have a great respect for what we do to make the vehicles as good as we can.  The weather stinks 6 months out of the year, though."
good,"Todos os dias eram desafiadores eram metas de produção e qualidade a serem atingidos bastante cobrança pelos resultados.A empresa foi uma escola e aprendi muita coisa ,como é importante o trabalho em equipe para que conseguimos atingir os objetivos,A direção e gerência sempre muito atuantes em todo o processo,quanto aos colegas eramos como uma famílía ,pessoas que quero levar no meu ciclo de amizade.Aparte mais dificildo trabalho era atingir as metas e a parte mais agradável era a união do time."
good,"as a shipping & receiving clerk, I strengthened my organization skills and material management. It was a very active job. My co-workers were a pleasure to work with."
good,"It's was a great place to work. Loved my job and the people there."
good,"Devido a situação econômica atual, não havia estabilidade nem perspectiva de contratação após o período de estágio."
good,"Friendly and very helpfull co-workers."
good,"No dia a dia não tinhamos muito tempo para conversar entre nós, mas sempre havia um tempo em que os lideres perguntavam um a um sobre o nosso trabalho. Tive ótimos colegas de trabalho e ótimos chefes."
good,Processos internos estabelecidos e que promove ótimo equilíbrio entre vida pessoal e empresarial.
good,"Durante os cinco primeiros minutos do dia é passado um diálogo sobre segurança, enfatizado sempre o colaborador a tomar cuidado consigo e com o próximo. Durante o dia de trabalho temos  todo as ferramentas que possibilita executar um bom trabalho."
good,"O nível adequado de burocracia atenua os riscos mas gera controles e atividades adicionais que podem comprometer os resultados e minar a disposição profissional. Em geral, a escassez de oportunidades gera elevado grau de competitividade entre os profissionais."
good,"Agradável, Responsável, Dinâmica, Motivadora."
good,"Uma excelente empresa para se trabalhar que oferece diversos beneficios, treinamentos, nela pude aprender muito nos dezesseis anos de carteira de trabalho desde o Senai. Nos ultimos anos devido a intervenção sindical por motivos trabalhistas a mesma começou a passar por periodos dificeis e acabou perdendo investimentos para fliliais localizadas em outras regiões resultando em demissões em massa."
good,"Nice jobs with a lot of overtime offered, but no direct hiring into the company. Enjoyed the production atmosphere and company events."
good,Good work-life balance and there is opportunity for career advancement.
good,GM offered individual freedom in decision making with little or no management needed.
good,"Uma das melhores épocas na empresa foi durante a implementação do projeto da Trailblazer em São José dos Campos. Na época eu trabalhava no Centro Tecnológico. Minha equipe e eu viajávamos semanalmente (em média 2 vezes por semana) para prestar suporte técnico à instalação da nova linha de produção e verificarmos se os parâmetros dos processos desenvolvidos no CT, estavam sendo corretamente seguidos."

good,"um trabalho um tanto pesado na produção, mais mesmo assim eu aprendi muito no trato com as pessoas e os desafios em um setor novo que era a metalurgia, processos gerenciais e operacionais novos, rotinas de qualidade e nos materiais da empresa; ótimo relacionamento com colegas e chefias diretas, acesso a diretores e gerentes companhia; O mais difícil foi a falta de promoções com o passar dos anos o mais agradável foi o desafio de aprender os processos diversos da GM, junto também o convívio com colegas que se tornaram grandes amigos."
good,"Hard fast pace work on assembly line,8to10hr.days .how to work with different tools and equip. by safety,comp. specs.work with management trying to do what is exspected from you.except -respect co-wokers because where their for same reason to make a living.learning some jobs because heavy machinery can be dangerous to operate.Most enjoyable is pay day!"

good,Empresa com bons benefícios e com ambiente muito agradável.
good,"Trabalho intenso e com muitos projtetos simultaneos sem estrutura de pessoal qualificado,Aprendi a ser criativo e resolver os problemas com muita pasciencia.A gerencia apoiava muito com dinamismo e pro atividade,os colegas sempre dispostos a ajudar e contribuir para alcançar os objetivos. A parte mais difici era fazer o trabalho sem recursos e cumprir o prazo.Nao tinha parte agradavel durante o serviço, mas apos o termino a vezes nos reuniamos para uma comemoração pelo excelente resultado."
good,"Had great fun in the field or the office, but getting GM to move on something was like trying to tow a fleet of Cadillacs through the mud by my teeth."
good,Assemble cars and SUV. Inspect chassie of vehicle for defects. Enjoyed the people I worked with. Learned that this was not what I wanted to do with my life. Hardest part of the the job was the repetitiveness of the job. Most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers.
good,Empresa que serve para preparação de profissionais. possui ótimas oportunidades para crescimento e investe bastante em treinamento de seus funcionários.
good,"En un dia normal de empleo en General Motors puedo realizar una capacitacion en linea (seguridad), o llevar acabo el desarrollo y planeacion de actividades de mantenimiento y administracion del personal para cumplir con los objetivos del equipo y a su ves con los de la planta."
good,not always at your desk might have to work at someone else's desk. You learned alot about the products and about the vehicles motors as wells as diagnostics. Can be very stressfull with trying to get things approved through the right channels. But overall not a bad place to work
good,06.00 a 15.00 hs
good,GM was a decent job the work hours i worked was 2:30-10:30 pm. the management was decent there they kept you informed however they didnt tell me that i was getting laid off until the last minute. hardest part about the job was working from 2:30-10:30pm. the best thing about the job was having the weekends off and the pay
good,"• Responsável por todas as atividades envolvendo os funcionários da empresa, tais como: fechamento de cartão de ponto, atualização de dados cadastrais, emissão de documentação, desenvolvimento de relatórios gerenciais, exames periódicos de saúde, transferências entre áreas, alteração de função e orçamento;"
good,seal auto bodies.I work 3rd shift i have great tm. mates the hardest job is scrapping the sealer off the auto bodies going home when shift is over.
good,"Es una exelente empresa donde hay oportunidades de crecimiento, buen ambiente de trabajo, donde aprendi mucho"
good,I started work at 7:30am Monday thru Friday. I regularly worked an hour to two over my shift with no additional compensation. 7:30 work started and continued steadily till lunch hour. There was plenty of work to keep me occupied. The management and employees worked hard. They were great to work with. The job was challenging but exciting. There was repetitive work daily but when changes were made it brought a sense of excitement to the day. I enjoyed the hard work load and attitudes of the employees.
good,This company was a good place to work because I was given the opportunity to develop new skills. My co-workers were great to wor with and very supportive. Management was always open to suggestions to improve quality and productivity
good,Only working per diem. Not enough hours and since obtaining my Master of Nursing would like to pursue employment as an Advance Practice Nurse.
good,company too big grate pay union and company ot gether worker lost in the mix
good,"Great place to work, a variety of things to work on and with, for example mainframe, plc, laptops, desktops, plant engineering in its entiriety, computer graphic."
good,Company's compensation and benefits are very good. Working conditions were tough but tolerable.
good,"One of the largest corporations I have ever worked for. You are treated with dignity and respect. Overall, one of my most favored positions."
good,Área de trabajo en la cual si no eres proactivo no aprendes de lo mucho que puedes aprender.
good,"Working at GM was rewarding and fulfilling , I enjoyed going to work ,I liked what I did and liked doing it for GM. The  pay was good,  benefits and working conditions were good also"
good,"Overall I enjoy working here, but because of the massive size of the company it's sometimes hard to get things moving along. The projects I work on are exciting and impactful to our customers, but could be more efficient with a smaller more nimble team."
good,There's always good and bad things when working for a large company. GM is no different than any other company I'm sure. It's usually all about the people you work with on a daily basis that determine how you feel at the end of the day. I've been fortunate over my 47 year career to work with some very good people at GM. But watch out for the managers looking to climb the ladder. next day your under the bus.One day your the best but the
good,"I like to add; GM has great benefits for you and your family. It's an occupation"
good,"i was a temp top until the strike happened, and had to fins other work. it's a good place to build a career. You'll work hard, you'll get pair weekly, and you'll get really good benefits-even if you're a temp for a while. Nothing negative to say."
good,Great people to work with! Level of work was balanced and the projects are rewarding. Managers understood life work balance and always worked for their people.
good,"I enjoyed working in a large campus environment. My position took me to every building in the campus, where I made a lot of professional relationship with many leaders."
good,"Great place to work. It took me almost three years to be hired full-time but usually still worked forty hours a week. It is disappointing that the plant will stopped assembly of their products at the end of 2019, but I hope that GM will return with new product that will be in demand providing much needed jobs in the area."
good,The college hire process was not well organized so speak up with your manager early if your not getting what you need. Once you settle in work life balance is good.
good,"The union did a good job of helping people from management and protecting our jobs. Show up on time, pick your rate, keeps the errors down, go home is a typical day."
good,Management was decent within the organization and the values regarding family and health make it a nice place to work. The hardest part of the job is dealing with little opportunity for growth with the organization and only possibilities being at corporate which necessitates relocation. The best part was managing a top-performing team and leading the nation in almost every metric.
good,"After morning hurdle up,I get a scan gun and login in my I’d.sequence parts and distribute to the bins for dealers to ship out."
good,Overall good experience but didn’t have a lot of freedom to truly innovate. Much more focused on getting a product out there for right now rather than looking forward.
good,"You work the hours needed to get the job done. Some days you'll work the 8 hours and go home others you may work 12 hours if the business case requires it. Depends on the role. However, culture is inclusive and you're entrusted to get your part done."
good,"After 20 years as a contract employee at GM, I interviewed for a direct position at GM and was offered the job and accepted.  I worked for GM for 14 months when I was part of a Staff Reduction and was replaced by a contract employee.  During my 14 months, GM management changed and my groups direct manager/ supervisor led us from his position in New York and I don't think had a good grasp on how things operated in my department.  I believe it was all about the bottom line and therefore I (and  the remaining direct GM employees - 3 others) was released by GM.   It was a very unfortunate situation, I worked my whole career to get  the opportunity to work directly for GM only to be told that you are doing a very good job but we are releasing you due to staff reductions!"
good,General Motors was a great place to work. I enjoyed my duties and the people I worked with. It is unfortunate that they have decided to discontinue production in Oshawa. Hence job security my main concern to continue to work for this company.
good,If you are looking for permanent work this may not be the job you're looking for....As a temporary worker pay rate is good you get healthcare and 3 days off in a year but they have to be approved.
good,"GM was a great place to work and experience the automotive manufacturing environment.  Salary and benefits were in line with competing companies.  Technology and environment were always changing internally to support production.  Overall culture was supportive, with many internal events to support local charities and causes."
good,I absolutely love this company the pay is good great benefits and wonderful mangers but what I love the most is the profit sharing thousands of dollars it comes in handy for the holidays
good,"GM is a typical a great company to work for. They do compensate well in entry positions and always challenge you with work. The work life balance is also good, with flexible hours and accommodations. However, after the initial start, the polish starts to wear away. Upward mobility is fairly stagnant with a lot of HR red tape and little explanation. Goals and measures are not clearly defined to business expectations. While you do have opportunities to move throughout the company, there is little mobility from organization to organization. Overall management is inefficient in process and most of the work falls on the shoulders of the ones working the hardest. Overall it was great starting out, but you start to see significant flaws in the long run"
good,"General Motors has been a great company to work for over the years.  I enjoyed the culture, people, and all my various job responsibilities.  The company allowed me to grow and take on new challenges."
good,"Sueldos muy bajos, prestaciones favorables, poca oportunidad de crecimiento..."
good,Great place to works. Work life is Great. GM does a great job of listening to its employees. I am very happy with GM but career advancement could be an issue
good,"I have enjoyed working here. All or most of training is OJT. Some room for advancement, Management is supportive. Have learned a lot on my own. Prepare to work 6 or 7 days."
good,First attend the morning metting and set line.Hourly production data checking and quality chek.And all line station check the no stopping line and solving problem on line
good,"Always thoroughly enjoyed my time with General Motors of Oshawa.  From my fellow trades to the production operators to even the management, it was always an interesting place to work."
good,"A typical day was checking my schedule and working on my assigned project."
good,"A empresa possui uma boa estrutura para quem busca aprender. Muito pacientes e ensinam com clareza. Pessoas de bem sem clima de disputa, mas não há oportunidades para estagiários."
good,"Very little.  It is out of balance.   Most workdays on the sales side of the business are 12-15 hours, and work days now essentially correspond to the hours dealers are open."
good,Pretty decent corporate gig. Pay is decent but they will also be on the lower end of things after a couple of years. the recent layoffs has the company culture in the garbage though.
good,"Muy buena. Habian cosas muy positivas como sueldo y demas bonos ( bono nocturno, sobretiempo, cesta ticket, seguro HCM, cesta navideña, bono de juguetes)"
good,"Good job work/life balance."
good,"Empresa excelente, contudo deveria buscar mais talentos internos."
good,Sub-system functional teams have experienced staff members and excel when put into a competitive environment. Experience gained during employment is very valuable and can be utilized throughout the automotive industry.
good,"I personally really enjoyed working here even if it was short lived, I didn't mind the repetitive work the people I worked with were all helpful, the atmosphere of the place was very positive up until the news of the plant shutting down. They are very strict on safety which was reassuring because it helps me keep myself out of getting an injury, management is very good if you need them they are always ready to assist you. they have plenty of holidays and lots of vacation time. I never really found any part of any job I've been on very hard except maybe learning them at first but after a day or so it gets much easier."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, capacitación constante todo muy bien"
good,"Definitely there are a lot of opportunities at this company to improve your skill-set, there are many projects and optimization efforts to improve your skills.  being pro-active will help you get the most out of your employment."
good,"Working with GM was one of my dream jobs,  The staff that was there were like family.  I woke up in the mornings and wanted to go to work.  I like the fast pace of the Call Centers.  During this job I learned to be a good manager.  I was responsible for several techs and I also was Site Leader for call center in Austin TX which I managed remotely.  A typical day for me was lots of meetings and decision making.  I would view ITSM of tickets for the techs to make sure they were getting the work done in a timely manner.  I was the go to for IT issues and escalations working with the business and suppler.  I handled approvals for ITSC."
good,"General Motors is always exploring ways to be on the cusp of emerging markets and technology which cause for new challenges and is extremely rewarding.  The hardest part can be trying to find the right person due to the vastness of the company but as you develop relationships, hard problems become simplistic."
good,"Overall a good company, but the culture for delivery in IT is lagging as it is almost all focused on annual budget cycle with very little agile or iterative delivery."
good,"The company is well managed by good managers and supervisors, All in all it was a good higher management experience for me. I can't think of any Cons for now."
good,GM is a good Company to work for. I enjoyed my time there. The people were great. The culture is good and you can get work done and enjoy your job at the same time.
good,"Co-workers are very nice.  They are dedicated, hard working and extremely intelligent.  Many of them have integrity and really care about their work.  Many opportunities to learn are provided.  Great communication about what is going on with the industry/company."
good,"Bom salario e benefícios, o problema é somente a forma que conduz a gestão das equipes através de lideres e facilitadores, pois acaba rolando benefícios dentro dos grupos por afinidade."
good,"My experience working with all the Telecom team was very positive.  Everyone is supportive and focused to successfully complete business projects."
good,"alto volume de produção, muita oportunidade de aprendizado com as melhores técnicas e métodos do mundo."
good,"GM is making difficult decisions now, while the economy is strong, to establish themselves as the leader in the future of mobility.  I applaud their efforts to become the leader in Zero Crashes, Emissions and Congestion.  It's been incredible to be a member of the GM Family."
good,Really enjoy working with the people on the lines. The jobs can be hard to learn but for the most part they are easy and fast paced. Management are always willing to talk to you and help if possible.
good,"I really enjoyed working at GM.  It's a great place to work, many learning opportunities and current technologies in use.  It was a pleasure to collaborate with others across the globe."
good,"overall good company, good benefits package, normal working hours, generally good management , free parking, nationally recognized company with good reputation"
good,"I was part of a involuntary layoff, so that colors any review I might be able to give - but while I was employed, I was happy with the culture, people, and the products we worked on.  It seemed that the company was interested keeping to its corporate mission statements and in the well-being of its employees."
good,"It's almost like how you think working for a large company would be. It's got all the same quirks. Bruracracy, cubicles, older mangment. But it strives for a great culture. You can really feel their yearning for a ""new age"" style of environment. More often than not they lisdten to suggestions about how to change the workplace and offer a lot of ways to suuceed and have fun through work. It's also really cool to work on the emrging technologies that are involved in the auto industry. Looking at GM from the inside I find that most people are wrong when they think about it. If we could just cut all the old stereotypes and stigmas about GM out I think people would realize hw advanced and great it really is."
good,I enjoyed working on setting up servers for uploading automation machinery. They allowed me to devolpment programs to increase work efficiency by 100%
good,"Fui estagiária, então não posso citar muito sobre salários e benefícios. "
good,"Only two complaints:"
good,"GM has been great over the years but now they seem to be so focused on running ""like a tech company"" that they no longer seem to value employees that have been dedicated for so many years.  The focus has shifted to a preference for millennials which is not in the spirit of a company who prides itself in diversity."
good,Great Company to work for but in transition now and not sure of my role.  Very good leadership.  Good work environment.  Used to be more confrontational but now more collaborative.  Opportuniites to work internationally
good,"I was only with GM for 2 years, but in that time I came to believe they are about their people. The problem is that they sometimes get in their way of showing it. The benefits are great and they try to have a good culture but it was pretty regular for leadership to be impersonal and communication was not always great. All in all though it was a good place to work."
good,"GM IT has pretty balanced Work/Life culture. IT work culture is also very flexible. There is very good learning atmosphere specially for fresh graduates with many boot-camp options. Also, with most of the tools available for the Job, learning new and cutting edge technologies is always encouraged."
good,"project budgeting, efficient resource allocation, project management, procurement techniques and strategic thinking, risk management, task oriented skills."
good,La empresa es excelente para laborar es un ambiente laboral muy agradable las áreas de trabajo o puestos son excelentes y tienes oportunidades de desarrollo
good,"Generally a good place to work. I have been treated fairly by all members of managment I have reported to.The hourly employees on machining and Assemby lines, the tradesman have bee a pleasant surprise.As a supervisor not employed at GM I heard the stories of a lazy and spoiled workforce.My experience in the 12 yrs at GM with hourly ee's has been very positive, I find them professional and committed to Safety and Quality."
good,Too many meetings and not enough hands on doing of work. Too many layers of performance goals and marketing programs. Difficult to perform well on some goals due to requirements to write reports and participate in numerous meetings. Upper management created too many sales and marketing programs that were in play simultaneously. We had a good team of well trained employees with years of experience. But the environment became strained as managers were asked to keep track of more programs involving parts and service sales goals each quarter.
good,"The is many opportunities for internal movement  and growth, but is subject to the automotive ups and downs so layoffs happen every few years.  Engineering management is technically competent but usually does not have much management training."
good,"Overall very good place to work and grow. Many opportunities to learn and develop as a professional, with ample benefits. The work environment was always very pleasant and full of freedom, allowing people to express their ideas and believes without reserves."
good,"General Motors Global Purchasing and Supply Chain organization is a challenging but rewarding place to work.  Pressure is high, objectives are sometimes nebulous, and meetings are excessive.  Nevertheless, power of the purse provides access to learn cross functional aspects of the automotive industry.  Pay is very good and culture is strong."
good,"Supervising crews who worked the metal stamping presses was fun and challenging."
good,I enjoyed working for General Motors and planned on finishing my career at General Motors. Unfortunately I am losing my job. The job was challenging and I leaned a lot from the company.
good,"From an operational perspective, General Motors is without a doubt the place to be for the best practices, policies and procedures. The management however can be very biased and unsecured, keeping away the support required and shut down prospective skills and potentials within team members. This is critical as it demotivates employees and limits advancements."
good,"Great place to work but, no job security, very cut throat with putting people out "
good,Se aprende mucho sobre la aplicación de los sistemas de calidad y manufactura.
good,"I learned many things from working as a contractor through General Motors.  Knowing the importance of vehicle safety was key to performing the duties within the Production control logistics and configuration side of the job.  Configuration of the vehicle was important to ensure the vehicles were built to the safety standards required by law and even though the fast paced environment was challenging, working in an environment where the end goals were shared, the teams produced solid results."
good,"The compensation was great, work life balance was equally great. You have the ability to work remotely if your role allows, lots of vacation and company holidays."
good,Management was very nice toward other employees. Coworkers were all very friendly. The Work environment was not stressful at all. Only issue I had was that I was a temporary employee and got laid off along with a hundred other people.
good,GM was an ok place to work pay was good.. and they do have of sense of work life balance.. only this was I didn't like what job I was going to everyday lil training on the job in they expect you to be perfect at it.. the jobs are very overloaded.. and if you stop the line supervisor's is on your head about it.. but they do treat workers fairly
good,"I enjoyed my time with General Motors. There was a feeling of accomplishment and being a team player. Pay was fair, and health benefits were excellent. The work was indeed stressful and physically demanding, but I was proud of the product that we were manufacturing. Management was fair and resourceful for the most part, but there were systems and procedures setup to help solve problems if and when they arose."
good,Possibilidade de aprendizado com esta tecnologia e contato para efetuar manutenções em geral.
good,"Competitive schedules and flexible time schedule on job, compensation above average, charitable giving is good, team building, self teaching, DFSS opportunity"
good,"People really impassioned about cars and what they do"
good,"Empresa seria de grande porte, tem oportunidades de crescimento para quem tem talento e vontade de trabalhar."
good,"Great place to work, but needs to work on diversity and inclusion in the Hungarian office. Very male centric organization. "
good,Mostly what I liked was to assist  fellow colleagues to meet their deadlines as I was always quick in completing mine.Managers usually came to my areal whenever there was audits going to take place.I always got a tap on my shoulder which made me very happy.
good,"As empresas acima sao otimas para se trabalhar, aprendi muitas coisas desde como receber , conferir e organizar as areas e materia prima que recebemos, tudo sobre qualidade e satisfacao do cliente ,todas tem a cultura de satisfacao e qualidade ."
good,Empresa de grande porte muito organizada e estruturada em todas as suas áreas de serviços e de suporte
good,"General Motors was a great opportunity. Although it does not have the fun atmosphere that a tech company would have, it is working towards that type of environment. For an older company, it has a great work life balance. My only objection is location and not much interest in the auto industry."
good,uma empresa de grande porte aonde existe muitos setores e posssibilidade interna
good,challenging days with work load balance requirements placed on the employee.  Management available to help guide efforts and provide support.  There are some edicts which are not changeable
good,"Fue la escuela donde aprendí la mayoría de los aspectos mas importantes del sector automotriz. "

Salary employees at GM are very helpful and coach you when first starting out. But you are expected to learn your job very quickly. Work life balance can be improved. Employees have to work long hours to finish work and there are several times a year you have to work weekends. Benefit to that is you get paid overtime to work.

My time spent within the facility has taught me a lot in regards to both mechanical and process engineering. I have worked alongside the launch team to provide assistance for our new development. I have learned how to use various types of equipment and how to accurately read a shot curve. In regards to the shot curve, I can diagnose potential issues within the machine, which could cause poor quality in our castings. I have learned a lot about the properties of aluminum and what could cause common defects and how to correct it. My current department has me primarily involved with CNC machines. The facility as a whole as a lot to offer and the management will go out of their way to ensure you have a good understanding of any issue you may face. The most enjoyable part of my job is working alongside the various skilled tradesman to diagnose and resolve an issue we may encounter. Granted, my position is a hands off position, but most workers will allow the extra help, which in turn helps me understand a majority of the repairs. The most difficult part of my job is the heat within the facility. It is a foundry environment, which is not climate controlled, so the summer time is a bit of a bear. However, I have found it will keep you involved enough to where the heat will not be a factor."

good,"Although it is a diverse organisation, they need people where the clients are, and the clients are largely in technology, especially systems integration. If this is your interest - go for Accenture, they are the biggest and best at it! If this is not your thing, as a grad starting out it is easy to think you will just work in this sector for a while before moving on to Strategy or MC - but if you are good at it, it will be very hard to leave. It is also different to other firms in that you generally do not jump between clients very often."
good,Great people to work with we joke around and just try to make the day go by management needs to see what's wrong before yelling on the radio about line being down.

O contato constante com meus Diretores me proporcionou uma ampla atuação nos estúdios de criação, possibilitando o planejamento e desenvolvimento de vários modelos de veículos e seus respectivos componentes. Obtive sempre o suporte dos colegas de várias áreas coligadas ao Design, no entanto, algumas áreas ligadas ao desenvolvimento técnico e custos, mantém algumas barreiras, as quais, limitam a criatividade e influenciam no acabamento final do produto. Muitos projetos iniciados e poucos finalizados... Prefiro o ""take a risk"" consciente, é claro, mas o mercado exige mais rapidez e dinamismo na execução e nas decisões. O colegismo é um fator positivo, importante na área do design e a importância que se dá ao Design somado ao foco no consumidor, sempre geram um ótimo resultado final."

Went from job to job mostly and enjoyed that as I am a quick learner and would allow me to meet more people. At the time we (new hires) were not considered as good as older employees and were treated differently. I do believe this has changed now though, was expected to learn fast and quick in a environment were that was needed. Learned a lot about vehicles,tools, and products.

São vários chefes na empresa e a grande maioria são excelentes profissionais, bem atenciosos, ótimos conselheiros, pegam bastante no pé dos funcionários que na minha opinião é muito bom isso. Tive grandes colegas de trabalho principalmente no time que eu trabalhava, todos ajudavam todos nas horas de correria, nos erros e acertos, procurando sempre melhorar mais. A parte mais dificil do trabalho era quando faltava um funcionário e assim aumentava muito o serviço para todos e a linha de produção na mesma velocidade as vezes até mais rápida.

good,Life at General Motors was typical that the expectation of the day were known ahead of time depending on your job or jobs.  During the years of working there quality classes necessity. On two different occasions had the chance to be a Team Leader.  Received lock out keys for machinery if needed millwrights.  Repairs on motors if machines rejected motors in case of human error.  Gave quality speech to six fellow employees.  Breaks if needed while the line running.  Helped with the start up of a new line.  During that time gave opinions on how to ergonomically correct and efficient way to put on different parts of the motor throughout the line.  Tore down and rebuild motors. Used the word uniformed because while the appearance of the lines changed it would change throughout the plant.  Once working on one of the lines with certain parts although the part will be larger or smaller they almost always had the same concept of how they do the job. Management changed during the course of years although at times certain managers would ask  specifically for you.  1993-1995 temporary full time employee and 1998 summer help. Called again permanent hire 1999.

Management allways treated me with respect,as I allways performed all of my tasks,to the best of my ability.All of my co-workers were great people, and treated me with respect.We all got along with each other. Hardest part of the job would be the wear and tear on your body. Heavy lifting in some areas. Most enjoyable part would be,the people on the shop floor. All there for the same thing.

good,"I worked at a small car assembly plant for GM. It was like a second home. Maybe that sounds good/bad for some but the department that I was in was close knit. Communications are on point compared to other manufacturers. Weekly meetings in a team/dept setting. For me, it was an enjoyable place to work. I was a FT Temp but laid off because of downsizing.

good,"I did like working for GM.  I didn't feel any threat to my security until they actually laid me off as part of the 15,000.  I like the management team, but would not have liked to be one during the ly offs, because I believe they really had no choice and had to do it anyway."

At the end of the day I would attend a daily wrap-up meeting to review any build issues that were discovered throughout the course of the day.

good,"It is a great company to work for, however the corporate is always greedy to make their shares. If they do not match their numbers they are will to give up their employees. I felt they are not always following their core values, and that bothered me a lot. They should be more customer focused than their shareholders. "
good,"I have autonomy in my job which I love.  My direct team is great.  IT management is in Austin and the business is in Warren - I feel like the management doesn't really get that we are a car company, not and IT company.  They seem disconnected from the business and frustrating to understand decisions at their level.  "

good,Very nice and professional environment. Management was helpful and there was lots of training specific to my technical area. Difficult at times to deal with the corporate game!
good,"With multiple locations throughout the US and world, General Motors is a great place to work when the economy is stable. Diverse group of people and great learning and advancement opportunity once you are a direct hire."
good,Great opportunities but once business picks up it gets very hectic and disorganized at times. The company is always looking to make cuts where possible.
good,Good company to work with.huge opportunity if you are direct employee.For contract workers changing team is not an option so that is a problem. But its good place to work with.
good,"Typical day in GM was going into daily meeting and basically working on the task you were assigned. General Motors was probably the best company that I have worked for. I have learned a lot especially when in came to depth using CAN. Colleagues - Management were the best part. Everyone knows how to play their role and that made the job even easier. Hardest part about the job was meeting deadlines when you had so many roadblocks. Other than that, great company, great staff and management."
good,"Os dias são muito Busy, eu Aprendi ir atrás de meus objetivos, direção um pouco burocrática, cultara e ambiente de trabanho são considerados excelente . a parte mais dificíl é a negociação com fornecedores complicaodos e a parte mais agradável são os relacionamentos, uma só equipe."

There are many events for team-building on a monthly basis and annual organization lunches along with weekly breakfast, daily lunches, and cultural events like Diwali, Christmas, New Year's, etc. The company provides benefits that are not matched at most other companies. The hardest part of the job is collaborating with outside teams. The most enjoyable part is the benefits, the breakfast, the lunches, the opportunity for breaks, ping-pong, and team-building opportunities."

good,"Un tipo de trabajo en Recurso Humano "
good,Typical day is 9 to 10 hours at the office some time after work hours.  Learned a lot form my time at GM.  Grew as an individual at work as well outside of work.
good,"General Motors was a great place to work, with great people. Over the years it has gone through some ups and downs. As of now there is less stability as many of their factories have been shuttered and they are currently hiring people at a much lower rate than they used to with a current salary cap for hourly workers far below the original top rate of pay. It's not bad money for no education, but if you're looking for something that pays more and has a future, you may wish to look elsewhere."
good,"This was the most physically and demanding job I ever had. The benefits and ""overtime"" was really nice. I made a decent living there. Most of the workers there became my ""Second Family""."
good,My time working for Vauxhall was exciting as there is a constant buzz around the office and there are plenty members of staff willing to give further advice and guidance in your progress at the company.

good,Em geral é uma empresa boa para trabalhar e com bons benefícios.
good,Overall General Motors is a good place to work but not contracted as you have no home life. I spent 90% on the road to help them out of a Jam and their idea was to make it permanent. Not ideal.
good,picked full lifts of stock and replace live pickers with full lift  when picking was done I unloaded trucks and put new stock away in reserve locations.  when not on forklift I walk picked orders for dealers and shipped. good job no complaints
good,GM pays good but some of the workers like to keep up trouble.  The workers will try and take your position by lying on you instead of earning it.  being fake is the new real.

good,"Dia de trabalho normal, ambiente amigável, aonde aprendi várias funções, a direção e a gerência são ótimas, Cultura e ambiente de trabalho de respeito e trabalho em equipe, a parte mais difícil do trabalho foi decorar todos os locais de aplicar a solda a ponto, pois havia vários pontos a serem feitos em cada operação , a verificação de vários pontos de operações anteriores,  pois a cada hora era feito o rodízio de operação, então até decorar todos os itens de cada operação foi um pouco difícil pois havia 15 operações de cada lado e cada operação era feita em uma estação diferente, com a linha em movimento e garantindo a qualidade do produto através da verificação das operações anteriores, mais isso foi só no começo, pois nao tinha experiência, mais logo me adaptei e com algumas melhorias implementadas o trabalho ficou muito mais simples e agradável."
good,"General Motors is a world class operation. I had the good fortune of working in by far the most professional environment of my career."

good,"Quality Inspection, Non destructive and Destructive Weld Inspection."
good,GM Fort Wayne assembly plant is 3 shift operation. Typical work day starts at 6am and most salary employees are expected to work 9 hours plus lunch. Salary employees at GM are very helpful and coach you when first starting out. But you are expected to learn your job very quickly. Work life balance can be improved. Employees have to work long hours to finish work and there are several times a year you have to work weekends. Benefit to that is you get paid overtime to work. Overall a decent workplace with relatively easy assignments but culture and work/life balance can be better.
good,Very fast paced and physical. GM provides excellent benefits and pay. Management is very demanding. Some of the managers are great and some not so much. The job itself is all about what you make of it. Required overtime on Saturday. Very demanding of your time. Second shift is not good for anyone with families.

My manager had a lot on his plate and was trying to juggle a lot of projects which put stress on the team but if we could have taken away a few projects it would have been the perfect environment to work in.

good,"If one is hired in, you are well taken care of, however if only temporary or season, the pay and steady hours can spoil you. Most jobs are easy to learn and are more tedious than physically demanding. Keeping up with the pace has a curve to it but one will adapt quickly, usually within a week."
good,A General Motors é um ótima empresa para se trabalhar com oportunidade para desenvolver a carreira em vários setores.

good,It prepared me for leadership. It showed me that you can do anything you put your mind too. Don't give up on yourself. You have to pull together as a team in order to succeed. The training classes was the best because it help us grow and make better decision for the business.

In managing the exterior trim parts list for the Corvette program, I was provided first-hand knowledge of the critical relationships between various engineering teams, design and the assembly plants and how my role in managing their input for deadlines fit within the entire organization with respect to meeting launch times for product release and ongoing changes.

You have a team full of experience and knowledge that will take the time to teach you the ins and outs of each task and purpose. At times, I believe it is over-managed. The culture is where there needs to be extreme improvement. The management fears the union and union workers. Makes it very tough on a manager to actually manage the people for real accountability. The HR department makes moves in management based on whether or not the union workers likes them rather than based on how good that manager is and if they are doing their job right. It is very much a political game culture. That is the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is what you learn while you are there."

good,"Good work experience,  however they're too strict on the past work experiences, the past is past and you cant rely on just the 1-2 work experiences that were only for a probationary period.  This company is the terminator for those who screwed or failed their previous employment and didnt disclose it.  My say on this is simple,  just tell them the truth and hope that these big boys give mercy."
good,I worked in several different fields within the corporation during my 21 years there.  Every department came with programs that need to be learned.  Customer and dealer service is priority.

GM also provided the uniform t-shirts so it made it easy to decide what to wear to work.  It was nice looking like everyone else too.  Management kept us updated on safety issues, production, money bonuses, and our healthcare benfits."
good,"My responsibility during my tenure was always the well being of our employees.

I worked well with my union partner.

good,"It is an accessible place, with highly trained staff that guides you during your stay, there are suitable facilities that allow you to make conceivable improvements"
good,GM offers competitive pay and benefits and good work/life balance. Culture and fit are very dependent on the group you work with and can vary wildly. Biggest drawbacks are that leaders/direction are always changing and our processes are far too complicated.
good,Very good and rewarding job if given the opportunity to work on a full time basis. The employees was helpful and friendly to work with. Everyone work as a team
good,"GM is changing. Nowadays I might consider it a good place to start and get some training. If you aren't advancing as fast as you would like to, you can move around inside and outside of GM. Staying in one place has no advantage any more like it used to."
good,The work environment depends entirely on who you work for and who is in your group.  The best thing about the company is that managers always seem to encourage their employees to learn as much as they can.

good,"General Motors is constantly working towards the safety of the people by improving the design and features of its vehicles. I work daily to verify that quality products and materials are manufactured to keep drivers and passengers safe and satisfied. Since working with General Motors I have improved on my Microsoft Office skills and have gained certifications for the use of manufacturing equipment, including Cognex vision systems and Fanuc robotics. The most challenging aspect of the job is the mental anxiety that is self-imposed. As I am relatively early in my career I get anxious about messing up a process or breaking a machine, even though this is prone to happen in an engineering career. At the same time, when a machine is in need of recovery I learn as much as possible from my co-workers to understand what steps they took to recover the machine. Overall General Motors has a good work environment."
good,While I worked at General Motors Asset Management I was able to gain the knowledge and skills that I currently have to better my career. The only reason I am not working at GM is the Corporate Accounting department was outsourced to the third party accounting entity.
good,Assemble midsize pickup trucks on assembly lines. Corporate guidelines were implement throughout plant to produce the best in quality products.  I supervised  to ensure a safe working environment was provided for assemblers; correct parts were made available to be assembled; proper training was provided on processes so that the assemblers could achieve the production of a quality product in the allotted time.  Areas that had problems were addressed and problem solving implemented.  .
good,GM is a great company to work for. The work/life balance is wonderful and allows you to focus on yourself professionally as well as personally. There are different areas of career growth available if one chooses to pursue them.
good,Arrival time is flexible but I arrive at 8 and leave around 4:30. Typically have 1-2 meetings a day but can be a lot more depending on function. Have been able to develop many new skills but many peers don't feel this way due to weak management at the team level. Management can be good to inept which can affect your experience. Culture is mildly formal but can also be quite relaxed. Dress is whatever is appropriate. Hardest part of the job is working in a bureaucracy as large as a small country and reactive rather than proactive corporate vision.  Work/life balance is quite nice in addition to significant corporate discounts on products.
good,"While highly dependent on your manager and director, i've enjoyed my time at GM."
good,"Working on the line has its pros and cons. Pros being that once you learn the job it becomes extremely easy, cons being a boring and repetitive job. starting salary is good and increases from there."
good,A typical day we built 300 to 400 cars a day. I learned how to follow standardized work order. Management changed about every 6 months. For the most part we worked together and helped out where needed. The hardest part was learning different jobs.

good,"En el dia a dia en General Motors Venezolana lo cotidiano y para mi opinion era el concepto de trabajo en equipo, ya que al momento de cualquier problema en algún punto del proceso de ensamblaje la preocupación tanto de operadores como supervisores y la gerencia de planta en general era de corregir y evitar que dicho problema volviese a ocurrir en el tiempo, implementando acciones tanto en el área de trabajo como de entrenamiento de los operarios con el fin de evitar la ocurrencia del problema al igual que toma de decisiones cuando los problemas no eran directamente del área de operaciones sino de los materiales que forman parte de las unidades."

good,Good exposure to learning new technologies. There is no undue pressure but the job requires being analytical. We engage in social activities like picnics and having potlucks.
good,". I learned many items relative to engine material and fracture modes dependent on whether they reside in the engine e.g. pistons or outside being exposed to possibly a corrosive environment. Management is about the same across organizations mainly hands-off rather managers rely on front-line supervisors to handle day-to-day activities. "
good,General Motors is a great company to work for if cars are your passion. The management and HR work directly with you to find the right place for your and their needs. Being a global company just expect to work early in the morning or late at night to complete tasks.

HARDEST PART when put on a job that I was not used too,  ENJOYABLE going on a job I was used too."
good,"GM is a good company to work for if you have a family/kids and need a balance between work and life. Once you leave the building at the end of the day, you don't have to think about work until the next day. Benefits are also great. However, since GM is such a large company, it's too bureaucratic for my tastes. Meetings every week and every assignment you get requires collaborating with people."

good,I loved working for GM! My time there was spent focusing on learning and developing new skills. My typical day was spend partially at my desk learning new software and the second half was spent on the shop floor observing and learning about how the work done in the office directly effects the production floor. My co-workers were amazing and promoted learning they did not just brush me off because i was an intern.

good,"Enjoyed my job."

I get along pretty good with all of my work mate we are all team player. The hardest part of the job is the cuts in labour and a higher work load. The best part of the job is its full time.

good,"working at GM was the best place to work, able to view new products and latest design."
good,"I came ""up through the ranks"" and had experiences from the production floor to administration and supervision. Each place had is challenges. One common challenge was communication. For as large a corporation and for as much policy/procedures, we always scrambled to have real time information on which to make decisions. The environment was fast-paced, 24/7 operation so team work was essential. Management was known to play favorites as well as find reasons for sudden dismissal of employees. Definitely a place to watch your back! Typical day requires extra hours or shifts to get the job done. Co-workers are some of the most dedicated, educated and responsive people I've had the pleasure to work with. They truly cared about the product and the customer. A job here is not for the faint hearted. We pound it out!"

good,O ambiente de trabalho proporcionado na empresa era muito bom.
good,"We all start at a certain time and you are expected to be there as line starts up ON TIME. It can be stressful due to fast pace but over all nothing we cant accomplished. What makes it hard at times is the long working hours with so much over time just leaving 1 day to rest and spend family time. What made it nice working there was the diversity of culture we have and management treats everyone equally. I always made the best of each day, but one thing I enjoyed was the charity events and my favorite was TOYS FOR KIDS during Christmas. Also there is a lot of career growth opportunity. Of course it takes some yrs but you need all the knowledge to understand how automotive industry works. GREAT COMPANY TO WORK FOR A LIFTIME!"
good,"The General Motor facility in Martinsburg had two major shifts. Daytime (6:00 am till 2:00 pm) and Nighttime (3:00 pm until 11:00 pm). As an operations supervisor (Intern) it's expected for management to come in before the shift to prepare for the day and take the time necessary after the shift to file an EOS report (End of Shift) which could be an additional two hours. A typical workday can be anywhere from 10 hours to 12 (Overtime). The pay definitely compensated for the additional hours."
good,"Challenging opportunities as the IT department is still transforming. Given the changing world of the automotive world, there is also a lot of opportunity to work on innovative ideas around autonomous vehicles and urban transportation. The only downside is the obvious nepotism among the people that have worked together at Dell and HP. Since the IT organization is beginning to wind down from its massive transformation, promotional opportunities are also beginning to dry up. That could be hindering for newer leaders. Overall, a good atmosphere for those with initiative that can adapt to change, especially for the car lover."

good,"Since GM was mostly an outsourced company, there was little knowledge of the details of running the  business and there  was a lot of dependencies on what the vendors said.  When I came in I was able to quickly identify there was a critical need for GM to take over its own data and perform its own analytics.  We put one 3 year  strategy to work on one portion of the business to show the amount of money they wee leaving on the table and quickly became trusted  advisor and have  built several strategies to take more control of our streams."
good,Giving Opportunities to grow next level of Career. Even though Hardest par of my work is fast passed time frame with meeting targets in given time frame hence we are really enjoying the same
good,"To Strive for excellence, to work in such an environment that will enhance my knowledge and career, where I can perform my management skills according my strong Caliber and efficiency."
good,A great company to work for.  A lot of change going on.  Many employees give off the entitlement vibe-not only to internal employees but to outside vendors.

I had 3 managers in my 4 1/2 years there and all were terrific. I volunteered with Team GM Cares and was involves in the Innovation Team; working on ideas in NX11 that would help all my co-workers.
good,A typical day starts with a daily stand up meeting.  Then we would code our story tasks and schedule team code reviews when needed.  The management is very approachable.  Everyone at the Innovation center seems to be nice for the most part.  The hardest parts are the more complex tasks.  The most enjoyable part is having the freedom to learn new things.

Merit based raises are not guaranteed but typically are given yearly. Good opportunities for career advancement but not a large range of advancement options from Intelligence position. Company culture is excellent and personnel are organized and friendly."

GM Financial offers a very nice benefit package and wonderful work/life balance not found in most corporations. They really care about their employees.

good,In the morning a meeting called fast response in order to know the issues in the last day and then you need to attend to yours suppliers and diary task. The hardest is is  any issue that need your attention should be immediately resolved or seek the solution to not affect the production line. The most enjoyable part is that you learn all time through this issues or about  the different process in production of your suppliers.

good,"The IT department is very exciting and innovative, however things can be bogged down by some of the older management. There are many people in high positions who have worked there for 30+ years and they are very much stuck in their dated ways. There is a tug of war feeling with those older individuals and new talent."

good,"GM has changed a lot in the last 5 years and often has a poor reputation that was not rightly earned. The benefits and pay are on par or above most other companies. The management has a good head on its shoulders (but, your mileage may vary depending on what group you are in... which is true for most companies). The is plenty of opportunity, but it isn't always easy to find the next step. Slow and Steady will serve you well. Overall, I would recommend them to anyone."

good,"that was an excellent job. inside, out of weather. pay wasGood, benefits Good. had a lot of instruction class/ tech taining to keep us up to date with technology"
good,A typical day at work includes a brief carry over of what I need to do. I am pretty much self motivated on the tasks that I need to complete as an employee. I have learned that you can be trained to do what ever you ask in the department the key is to continue studying what you learned over and over until you really understand the subject. My co-workers is pretty small but we all get along to get the jobs at hand taken care of whenever needed but as long as we arrive safely at work and leave safely we can do it again another day. There really isn't anything hard about my job because I feel as though I have pushed my self and learn what I need to whenever the task is presented to me. The hardest part of the job was knowing that even though I was a contract employee I never had a reassuring feeling of being at a secure job.
good,I am a relief operator within my unit. I problem solve and make necessary repair on doors when necessary. My coworkers are dedicated to making a successful product to ensure future product at our plant. The most enjoyable part of my job would be the diverse population that I work with on a daily basis.

They expect the best but you know you are working as a team and they will train you to get you where they need you to be - they don't give up on you.

good,It was a good experience to work for the big three the benefits were great the people were good and understanding i would greatly recommend working for this company
good,"TRACK is the rotation program at GM for entry-level engineers. I spend 4 months each in 6 different positions and it really helped me figure out what I wanted to to at the company and in my career. The biggest complaint was that 4 months wasn't enough time to get trained and make an impact in your role. However, I think the short rotations were a good thing because it gave me exposure to more engineering fields in the company and allowed me to quickly get out of a position I didn't like."
good,I loved my job I just wish it could have lasted longer the plant which I worked was closed due to the enconomy slump.and some jobs were sent overseas and to mexico.

good,GM was a good place to work. The work balance life and community service was a part of the company's values. The hardest part of the job was the employees losing their job as a result of lay-offs. Management focuses on delivering a better experience for internal and external customers. I enjoyed the multi-cultural environment and team events. I learned a great deal while working within the General Motors family. I plan to take my experience to the next career opportunity within the next company.

Management is great, everyone gets along, goals are clearly defined and help is always there if you need it. Work-life balance is really good and the company really does strive to make work a stress-free environment. Hardest part of the job is sitting down all day, best part is speaking with customers and helping them solve their problems. Pay is about average at $20 an hour, but goes up some based on years and productivity."

good,"We would come in and stretch first and listen to what the supervisor had to say about safety concerns and other things. Then we would get our production work and start the day.

good,"My overall experience was excellent.  The disaster at GM that occurred last year when they did the 15% salaried layoffs, I learned later, just by my regular attendance at local gyms and reputable restaurant establishments at which I meet many new people every day who reside in the Shelby Twp. and surrounding areas, that these were performance layoffs.  When I was at GM, I actually resigned from my new direct hire position after 8 months because my manager, who I had supported like a loyal employee and her new top promising DRE, decided both to overload me AND then after seeing a significant drop in my performance due to carrying 13 rather than 6 programs due to personnel leaving our group, then began to punish me and tell me I was getting a performance review to 'prevent me from being setup for failure.'  Well, obviously that happened before I even agreed to take on the extra work without complaint and deciding to be an upstanding employee because I thought it was the right thing.  She was NOT a professional manager.  She had 20 years in at GM and I was hired into a direct role after being a contractor for only 1 yr and 8 months in our commodity's validation group.  That's unheard of.  My validation manager was a contract engineer for 5 years before being hired in direct (and not as a manager - he started at the bottom of the engineering chain also, and the DRE position at GM is the creme of the crop of the bottom of the engineering structure - validation engineers are looked at as sub-standard to DREs whether it is a fair assessment or not).  The Technical Integration Engineer"

good,Productive and very productive with high productivity on all assembly fabrication lines; Quality and productivity represent a very high interest for the fabrication process

good,"Being one of ten students in my high school to have had the opportunity to work for the General Motors Student Corps intern group was amazing. I was one of two speakers at our final event to speak in front of the chair of GM as well as 200 other people in the GM Tech Center in Warren, MI."
good,"Overall good place to work, but very little job stability. Good managers at time. Almost everyone I met loved to work there. I would recommend for a new grad."
good,A good environment to learn new technologies. No micro management. Too much rules. No job security. IT is way too slow to get computers fixed or new softwares installed.
good,"Working with Suppliers, colleagues, students and the newly hired was extremely rewarding.  The culture can be challenging at times which deflects from the teams ability to be the best it can be."
good,Horaires difficiles pour l'équipe du matin (5h-12h) contrairement à l'équipe de l'après-midi (13h-20h) mais une bonne ambiance de travail.
good,"Good work life balance. Good place for college hires to get the entry into IT world."

good,I enjoyed the hours but the days i worked I really didn't care for. But for the most part as long as you are doing your job getting to work on time and working the job is easy.
good,"A General Motors é uma ótima empresa, com bons benefício e é um lugar onde pode se aprender muito com o serviço, único ponto que é desfavorável é a parte gerencial onde prezam mais pela parte burocrática do que a técnica e isso fez com que a empresa perdesse bons profissionais."

good,Empresa dinâmica agradável para trabalhar bons benefícios
good,The people you will work there are great on the front lines. The employees are fantastic as are most of the management staff. The biggest problem is the constant 7 days a week work week. While the pay is great everything else suffers and not many willing participants to come and assist you and take some OT for you.
good,"Kudos to our CIO for bringing all the overseas contract support jobs back to the United States."
good,"lots of drama but good pay, fantastic benefits, not terribly hard work, show up do the job collect the paycheck don't complain or cause problems and survive"

good,"Worked in the Enterprise Data Warehouse, a great opportunity to work in a well established company with the feel of a start-up due to the EDW being created in late 2012."
good,"I worked at GM because my father was able to pull some strings and get me into the factory. The money was good along with the benifits. The jobs themselves were smelly, dirty and not pleasant. Even though I worked there for 8 years, and going to school, I was never happier to leave a job."
good,A melhor parte de trabalhar na GM do Brasil é o clima organizacional e as pessoas que trabalham lá.

good,I miss my working days in this company. Because there is a very systematic procedures and plannings. Right use of time. 
good,"A typical work day a GM was great! Everyone was friendly including management. I have learned that if you can hold on to a job with an environment like this one, please do!!! The hardest part of working for this company is if the machine broke down, you would have to keep busy. I had a great time with this company absolutely no complaints here."
good,"proficional,noqual aprendi muto sobre segurança,espirito de equipe e sistema global de manufatura,na qual fui bem orientado por minha gerencia.tinhamos um grande espirito de equipe no qual solucionavamos todos os desafios,parte mais dificil esforsso para mantermos a qualidade e mais agradavel era a amisade de todos os companheiros de tra balho."

good,"Rotina da industria é um pouco repetitiva, porem como trabalhei por diversos setores sempre querendo aprender mais essa rotina não foi um ""problema"", a politica do QI que incomodava, em relação aos colegas o pessoal era muito bom para o relacionamento pois fiz grandes amigos lá que mantenho até hoje. Acredito que a pressão psicológica o assedio moral tornava o trabalho difícil e a melhor parte eram os benefícios que a empresa oferece."
good,"A empresa tem uma ótima cultura, preza pelos valores e inovação. O ambiente de modo geral é muito agradável, tranquilo e as pessoas sempre muito educadas."
good,It takes too long to get hired when we do the same job ar hired in associate. Some associates are stubborn. As a temporary the days off is hard to get off for you. They bring you in as a Saturday worker only but you are working 6 days a week 8 to 12 hours days.
good,"Line Flow, attending work on time, and being alert is very important. I try to learn something new everyday."
good,i had learned that going to work starting out with a positive attitude will help u had a more profitable day I have learned that working with different kinds of people and cultures is always a pleasure. the hardest part of the job is at the end of the day because of specific reasons beyond your control u are unable to help others in their struggle.But with that being said the best part of the day is when u have accomplished your job to perfection and a 100% then u can say a job well done!!
good,"Very good money, paid vacay. Management sucked, but we got thru it. Plant closed and gave us buyout and payed for school so intent to nursing school on them"
good,I liked the job because of the payment but it was hard only because of the heat and the fact that we had to one out side so much but I enjoyed working with others
good,"The work can be tough but I'm proud to work for gm. I enjoy the work, good pay and benefits and working with lots of great people who have become great friends"
good,Was okay until company started going under. Much Layoffs and wasn't enough work to go back to. Would have love to go back but they eventually put me on full time Layoff with no returning back.
good,"As with any large corporation, there are policies on policies and the political culture is one that often contradicts itself. The work is not hard or stressful, it just lacks growth potential for technicians. If you have an engineering degree, Go for it! there is plenty of room to move up and grow. Overall, it is a great place to work."
good,"I wouldn't change anything about working here, unless it was changed management and make it we all work together,to make a great product. Again I'm nice.."
good,"GM is a great place for those who like a fast paced work environment with heavy lifting and constant movement. Good pay, good management and lots to keep you busy."
good,Empresa dinâmica e recentemente passando por muitas re-estruturações.
good,Gm teammmates become second family wether you like it or not.  Can be very stressful at times but well worth it.  At times the hardest part of the job was working with the union but they have lost so much ground recently that this would no longer pose the same stresses as in the past.
good,When the economy is doing well you work a lot of overtime.  When the economy is doing bad you are laid off.  I was working overtime right up to the point I was laid off

good,"Legal Assistant on Product Litigation Cases"
good,"As a temp you aren't guaranteed a permanent job. You have no benefits other than health insurance. No paid time off, unable to call in. Have to work days that are required. You can work for 2 years straight full time and they can knock you down to one day a week with out notice. Good place to get your foot in but good work ethic will not get you hired in unfortunately, it is strictly ""seniority"" the union dips there fingers in the honey pot as well so you can't count on them."
good,"I would not have left if I would have been receiving more hours as well as a permanent spot. I didn’t want to always worry about my position. Although, overall I did enjoy my time there."

good,"I truly enjoyed working at GM. The overtime was endless when I was there, a great opportunity at the time. It was hot & dirty work, but my ""GM Friends & Family"" made every minute worthwhile."
good,GM is a fact paced and challenging place to work.  Challenging yet very rewarding.  Every day is a different challenge and the most rewarding part is coming together as a TEAM and finding resolution to issues.
good,"Was still a temp when were notified of GM eliminating a shift. Result Indefinate lay off come September.  I had almost 2 years in as a temp. Bounced around in Chassis as a pool person for about first year, made shift fly by. Finally was placed on daily job. You can have battery powered radios and fans at station. Typical day is coming in and having team meeting, check work station parts to ensure right parts for job. Worked with a lot of great people. If I had a chance to go back, I would in a heartbeat! Hopefully Union can negotiate hire process be no longer than a year for temps. "
good,"Foi muito bom a experiência nessa empresa fiquei apenas triste por não ter motivo nenhum de eu ser demitido, infelizmente a crise chegou e bateu na porta de muitas pessoas."
good,"-High-paced environment"
good,I love the job but I think everyone should make equal pay. You don't get much time to spend with family because of the 6 day work week. As much time as we spend there we should get a two week shutdown sometime in the summer
good,"All around good working environment. Safety top priority with Gm."
good,"Empresa de grande porte com oportunidade de desenvolvimento pessoal, oferece treinamento constantemente."

good,"Empresa ótima para se trabalha onde aprendi muito, aprendi trabalha com usinagem de peça como eixo de comando, bloco do motor e cabeçote e na linha de motores. A direção exigente pois a linha de montagem não podia parar os colegas profissionais comprometido com o time o departamento já a parte mais difícil foi muitos sábados e domingos na fábrica e a mais agradável o conhecimento que era adquirido dia dia ."
good,Good for work for short period ~3-6 yrs. Global management is excellent. Future growth depends on opportunity only. Office politics is a negative part for India level management.
good,One always has to reach the goals set by the companies and always reaching constant high performances to please everything and everyone. Company with good benefits of careers.
good,"requires 12 hr days sometimes, management works well with workers, gives ample enough time to learn and will take the time to help its workers, co workers are fun and usally helpful, long hours of repetive work is the hardest part, the benefits of holiday meals, friends,busy work,good pay and great management."
good,"Could be a tough place to work for salaried employees. The people there were very nice and professional. Enjoyed my time there but the IT dept. was very shorthanded, which required longer hours beyond the norm without compensation."
good,"You can work very long hours and 6 or more days a week depending on demand for vehicles. Management is very hard on their employees and write you up any chance they get. Great company to work for, but management can be very stressful."

good,"na GM do Brasil onde primeiramente comecei como auxiliar de produção onde exerci a função por nove meses, depois passei para líder de grupo onde fiquei por seis meses e logo após fui promovido para a GSA como analista onde era responsável pela qualidade e aprovação dos veículos produzidos pela empresa."
good,"Uma excelente empresa , porem com poucas oportunidades de ascensão profissional justamente por tratar-se de empresa muito grande, porem da ao funcionário um excelente base e suporte sobre o funcionamento correto de uma organização."
good,"muy buen fue un trabajo estable "
good,Great Company to work for...  GM moves too slow and is lethargic in keeping pace with industry.  Too conservative and unless it was invented here by upper management it all too often doesn't get implemented.  Politics is the cancer of GM; it always has been.  I have made GM millions of dollars over the years however I saw less than 1 thousandths of 1 % of it.
good,"considero que trabajar en GM fue una gran experiencia, no solo por el ambiente laboral si no también por el gran aprendizaje que deja, mi experiencia laboral y mi visión de trabajo en la industria definitivamente fue otra después de GM, trabajar ahí me ayudo a ser un mejor profesionista, el aprendizaje y el entrenamiento obtenido lo considero de gran valor."
good,Very positive attitude from the people GM hires. Makes it a nice place to work.  Managers encourage their employees to excel and move up in the company

good,"Perfection & hardworking is important in any job . By giving breakfast &tea provide  to workers .GM is one of leading car "
good,"Mostly great workers building some exellent cars & trucks."
good,GM was a great place to work. I advanced my skills in how to multi-task in a very fast paced environment. My supervisors and upper management I dealt with were helpful and answered all questions I had. The downside to the job was that as a Temporary SSO there was no job security at all. I could come in any day and they could just dismiss me with no compensation.
good,Otima oportunidade de aprendizado mas muito instavel ao mercado de vendas
good,"Uma otima empresa, na qual cresci profissionalmente, e desenvolvi experiencia."
good,"Foi uma Empresa que me deu muitas oportunidades de crescimento tanto profissional como pessoal, nesses anos que lá trabalhei so tenho a agradecer por tudo que construi ao longo destes anos."
good,Great company to work for. Nice to work with a lot of smart people.
good,"A typical day at work would include working on an assembly line on an assigned job with co-workers to build Cruzes, Ecos, and Diesels.  I would check the O2 Sensor to make sure it was connected, check to make sure brackets were intact, check fuel lines to make sure they were connected and locked, attach a clip in the rear of the car, place two push pins in the rear fascia of each car, operate the pinch bolt to tighten bolts on inside of front passenger wheel, and use a power tool to put heat shields on.  On Ecos and Diesels, I was also required to bolt on a special panel.  My co-workers were all very nice and helpful; we worked as a team to keep the assembly line moving to hit our daily goals."
good,"É muito corrido a produção, devemos nos manter sempre persistentes  e motivados para a execução do trabalho, geralmente não nos cabe o contato direto ao gerencia e isso estreita um pouco o contato com o chão de fabrica, no entanto, com os colegas de times já é bem diferente, trocamos idéiais e procuramos resolver questões entre nos mesmos. A parte mais difícil é quando começa a ter problemas de produção como quebras de linha, operação errada e outras coisas q podem parar a linha , isso faz com que a linha fique mais rápida quando volta ao normal, mas também existe o lado bom que é a relação positiva com os colegas trabalho, o andamento correto e normal das atividades produtivas."
good,"Always had at least a 40 hr week, I worked on the production line and also worked in the body shop. Great co workers. I enjoyed this job because everything about it was simple show up, do the job youre assigned to until your shift ended."
good,"Great people and fun environment to work."
good,"Empresa dimânica rápida em solucionar problemas e adaptação a  a economia do País,pois não há um plano de carreira robusto dos empregados da fabrica."
good,Construí minha vida ao longo dos 26 anos que dediquei a essa empresa.Só tenho que agradecer por tudo que vivi nesse que foi meu primeiro e único emprego até aqui.
good,"El ambiente es bueno, solo que de los salarios no puedo hablar ya que estaba como practicante y no me pagaban, pero el ambiente y el desarrollo es bueno"
good,"Working at general motors temporarily meant that I was an extra hand where ever the plant needed me. I could be put any where on any given day, and was responsible for learning a job quickly and efficiently. I worked hard at any job I was put at. I learned how to work with new people daily. Management was well-experienced and was willing to help me learn the job. I enjoyed my co-workers, they helped me learn the new job and the new work environment. The hardest part of the job was the work load, it was a different and new kind of experience for me."
good,enjoyed job overall and wish plant had not closed.
good,g.m

good,Estou a 4 anos na empresa e sou muito grato por fazer parte dessa companhia.
good,"Good. I have very good experience there. But GM should think about salary package that they offer to their employee. "

good,"Un infraestructura organizada, trabajo en planta en diferentes turnos, aplicación de conocimientos de ergonómica"
good,"It's a pretty good place to work. I really enjoy the people and for the most part management is pretty good. I have done lots of different things for GM. I have have relocated over 1,200 miles in the last 20yrs. So it's a great company to work for."
good,"Excelente empresa, aprendes mucho si así lo deseas"
good,"I love my job at GM , but unfortunately some of my coworkers have a very poor work ethic.Its a shame that with the great pay and great benefits that some of these people can't appreciate how blessed they are to have a job with great pay and benefits."
good,"Would say it a good place to work"
good,"It is a typical job of a manufacturing operator, it involves a lot of physical effort, it is among the best-paid jobs in the region in Mexico, but it is always good to look for better opportunities"
good,"excelente ambiente laboral los compañeros muy preparados con facilidad de resolución de problemas, aportación a los procesos por medio de capacitación y trabajo en equipo, un lugar cómodo para poder desempeñar los conocimientos adquiridos a lo largo de las trayectorias laborales llena de retos y nuevos aprendizajes"
good,"Hard work at times but stick with it, there's not a whole lot of factory work that pays this well. Room to do different jobs, longer your there the better the job"
good,A great paying job but it’s not reliable if your a temp. They can let you go at anytime. It’s very fast paced and it’s a lot of hard work. Should be in okay shape to do the job.
good,Trabalhei na área da manutenção e tive a oportunidade de aprender muito e ter tido grandes oportunidades como trabalhar na fábrica da Argentina.
good,Being apart of a product that has excellent quality and safety standards gives me great pride.  I stand behind every SUV that rolled off if the assembly line at the GM Arlington Plant.
good,Depending  where you are you will get some good training or you will get someone who will try to train you in 30 mins and leave you .on your own. Must NOT stop the line if possible and learn as may jobs as possible.
good,"ótimo aprendizado, ótimos líderes, me abriu muitas portas."
good,I have no comment I enjoyed my time at GM.  I worked 12 to 14 hour days sometimes 6 days a week.  I traveled every day of the week and am accustomed to the lifestyle this affords
good,"Un día tipico en uno de los servicios medicos, era llegar y recibir incapacidades de los colaboradores, revisar que esten en orden y fecha para no perjudiciarles economicamente, asi mismo revisar y evaluar las ST-2, ST-7, ST-9."
good,there was alot of different jobs you had to work at until you got more time in the plant to move to different jobs once you got more time in you could fine a nice job a little better work environment and maybe fine a better supervisor to work four
good,"Buena empresa con buenas prestaciones,el turno de 12 horas es pesado"
good,GM is a great company to work for with great beenfits. Working for GM is stress free and. The 401k benefits are great as Gm will match 4% and add an additional 4% free.
good,"Ótima empresa , um ótimo seguimento , qualifica seus funcionários para todas as áreas, inclusive de fornecedores e serviços. cultura da qualidade excelente, falta um pouco de cuidado com o ambiente de trabalho , insalubre."
good,Best part of working at GM is the people.  Most people are very happy with their teams and the opportunity to contribute.  Employees are usually very willing to help their peers and to ask for help when they need it.  GM has many online resources and provides time for training and personal development.  There is a great mix of seasoned professionals and recent college graduates and the diversity usually fosters creative thinking and sharing of ideas.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with sudden changes to strategy or budgets.  The best part of the job is the people who can help solve problems and come up with solutions.
good,"GM is forward looking and takes steps to stay on top of automotive technology and market position."
good,I learned a lot working for General Motors. The pay was very good and the bonuses were a definite bonus. The schedule fit with me well on first shift. Second and third shifts not so much. I enjoyed getting to know a great number of coworkers and serving them.
good,Great place to start and end your career with GM.The only comment that I was facing that  me and many doesn't have enough space and vacancies to grow and expand your experience .
good,"Uma empresa excelente , colaborei por seis anos e fui bem recompensado por isso . O ciclo foi encerrado , porém sai com a sensação de dever cumprido , só tenho a agradecer , muitos aprendizados , culturalmente só agregou meu curriculo profissional."
good,"Excelente empresa ára se trabalhar, oferece grandes oportunidades."
good,"The culture is awesome, they really support furthering your learning and growth potential. the drawback as a contractor is a lot of false promises to get hired. It can take years."
good,It’s a amazing company but it’s a job not a career it’s not room for growth or advancement it has its pros and cons like any other company but at times you feel stuck
good,Good place to worked learned how to be hands on learned how to deal with people learned how to be responable drive fork truck deliver parts to line load and unload trucks
good,"GM, you know all the pros and cons. As its branch in Asia Pacific, its the backbone for GM global. I mean more than 50% of sales and incomes for GM are all from Asia Pacific. Since the purchasing amount are huge in the region, the workload are huge if you work in Global Purchasing and Supplier Chain Dept. as I did. If you're ambitious and full of energy to sail out in automobile industry, this company is good for you to gather all the experience you need for next step."
good,I would still be at GM had they not opened up a new plant.  They only had the people with the most seniority continue on in the new plant.  I wish I was still there!
good,Great company. But the economy is getting better and no one is buying small cars. Cause if a cut of a shift and laying me and 1499 other members looking for work

good,Trabalhos de grandes dimensões com relação a desenvolvimento de protótipos.
good,"Um ótimo ambiente com diversas oportunidades de aprendizado, suporte e recursos de ponta com acesso a tecnologias de ponta. Ambiente e benefício compatíveis."
good,I was a part of the union and the union makes sure the employees have a fair chance and a great work environment. general motors was a great company but due to economical downfall they are downsizing to 2 shifts and getting rid of their 3rd shift therefore I only have 3 years seniority so I was layed off indefinitely

good,"My typical day is to run spreadsheets, I learned a lot of acronyms and a lot about what it cost to run GM. GM is the typical Engineering firm with opportunities, if you work for it, you are expected to stay in one position for a minimum of 4 to 5 years and then move. The hardest part of my job is that everyone calls the same thing, something different, so keeping that straight is difficult. I like the people I work with they are great."
good,"Working at General Motors is a fast paced environment,  if you are a fast learner and able to adapt to changes this is a great opportunity for you.

Management is pretty good overall.  This is a union backed company."
good,"It was great to only work  Monday  through Friday and had all paid Holidays off. It was a fast paced job, and if you put your effort into learing all the jobs, the other employees would jump in and help you if needed.  I really enjoyed working there."
good,Lot of learning opportunity. Very good environmental. It depends how you start and how you take every opportunity of learning. Lot of exposure given to all..
good,Good place to work but slow sales prompt frequent lay offs. The pay scale for hourly workers is good. The union is very good. The work on the assembly line can be quite taxing. Lay off benefits are very good.

good,"Oportunidades apenas para quem tem parentesco,deveria ser flexivel com todos"
good,The best thing about this job is the pay. The down side is working six days a week. The work environment itself isn't bad just be mindful that it's a factory. So if is hot outside is going to be even hotter inside the building. GM does try to accommodate by having fans and ac throughout the building.

good,"Capacidade de resposta da gestão muito rápida, ambiente trabalho muito bom, satisfação em ter trabalhado numa empresa multinacional"

good,Assembled sierra truck through various jobs was basically a temp under 90 days. I was angry because in orientation they promised us at least 2 years of work because the plant was closing.  I got 3 months of work under and couldn't even get unemployment.  Cafeteria very expensive.  Kind of sexist and racist. My supervisor had it in for me for silly reasons had to call UAW on her because I would get 17.00 checks for a whole week instead of what I truly earned.

General motors is based on seniority and if you don't have it, you get laid off."

A parte mais difícil é acompanharmos  a política  adotada entre empresa e sindicato para fecharem varios postos de trabalho em sjcampos."
good,"Muitos desafios "
good,"nice culture and long history"
good,"As a contractor however, it is hard to move into a full time direct position."
good,"I loved what I did and who I worked with, my first year was a constant change.  We went from Lotus Notes 8.5 to Outlook 2013.  They also changed 2 other websites I used continuously while hiring and onboarding new employees and managing the floor.  I worked for 2 CISO's and 5 other executives and many other directors and managers.  I was very busy in not only managing my boss, and my executives, but also all those that were new and trained other admins that needed assistance in learning the new Outlook and Office Suite 2013.  I would always tell people instead of learning something new everyday I learned many new things everyday.  I loved the challenge and how busy the days were.  I organized many events, trips and team building meetings all over the country with our team.  I always tried to do things as quickly and as accurately as possible.  There was nothing I couldn't do.  I always had a way to fix something or find a solution.  I surprised many people and they always knew I was there go to person.  I had managers that tried to do requests with no response and when I did it I could get it done within a week.  I loved that I could do that."

A gerência não era uma pessoal imparcial e era de difícil convivência, o ambiente de trabalho era razoável, trabalhava em uma das áreas mais cobiçadas da empresa - Engenharia do Produto, e todos lá eram altamente competitivos. Parte difícil do meu trabalho era ter que me dedicar também fora do meu horário de trabalho com cursos. E a parte agradável era trabalhar com algo que realmente me entusiasma."

good,"A empresa proporciona condições de desenvolvimento profissional e tem como principal objetivo a segurança das pessoas. Oferece também ótimos benefícios através de convênios médicos, participação nos resultados, lazer (ADC), transporte, Previdência Complementar e alimentação. Acredito que uma rotatividade a nível gerencial deveria ser mais frequente fortalecendo a troca de experiência (best practices). Entendo que a parte mais difícil foi administrar a grande preocupação das pessoas com as perdas de vários postos de trabalho anunciadas em função da falta de investimentos em novos produtos. A parte mais agradável está na cobrança da liderança da empresa quanto a valorização, o respeito as pessoas,  trabalho em times e principalmente a pratica da empatia. Além disso, o nível de qualidade dos produtos é motivo de satisfação de todos os envolvidos.    "

I would have to learn the new job in a few minutes. I enjoyed this job because I got to learn new jobs and work with different people."
good,"Trabalho extremamente dinâmico, onde aprendi a desenvolver ainda mais meu lado pró-ativo e flexivel. Tive ótimos relacionamentos com a equipe de trabalho e superiores o que torna o trabalho mais agradável, apesar dos desafios diários de uma grande montadora.

If you are looking for a fast paced, and can stand the heat thia is the place! I would not suggest it if you have asthma or allergies to certain things.

good,"Ótimos benefícios, e lugar pra se trabalhar e excelente experiência  adquirida em produção."
good,"Fazer cursos, se relacionar com todos os níveis de funcionário e aprender muito todos os dias."
good,On a typical day working for General Motors I would take start up parts from each machine and inspect them for any signs of defects. if there were defects I would inform the set-ups of the issues to resolve before they can produce quality parts. Once the machines are approved to run then I would randomly inspect parts during the day to make sure the parts meet the GM standards. One of the first things you learn a lot from inspecting parts is that one minute every part is excellent and the next you have an issue. the good thing about quality is that if I ever had an issue the management was available to hear me out on possible issues. The hardest part of this job is that sometimes your working non-stop and other times you end up with down time. This job was enjoyable for many reasons but the biggest was the fact that I got to interact with all aspects of the parts I inspected and the people involved in their creation.

La dirección fue muy ""antigua escuela"" pero al parecer eso está cambiando al no tener solamente gente que inició como practicante y llegó a director por ejemplo. La parte más difícil es la ubicación del centro de ingeniería."

Working on the line doing the job that I had gave me a chance to get exercise and get in better physical shape than when I worked in an office and sat at a desk.  I only wish there hadn't been smoking on the line and in the assembly area.    I worked on the line with some great people.

good,Te birndan el apoyo necesario para poder realizar tus actividades a desempeñar.
good,"Spent a lot of time collaborating with other engineers to get things ""right"". The amount of time spent in meetings has dramatically decreased in the last several years freeing up time to do meaningful work.

good,Started at 5am ended at 2pm. I learned about General Motors vehicles. Management was good. I got along with all my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was working at on hard job at a very fast pace. The pay was great.
good,"Well all start off individually when we get to work with a greeting to all. I have learned a lot form the engineers that I dealt with directly anywhere from being loyal to you job to being firm with a supplier if you have to get the parts that you need for the company. Management goes up and down which I understand completely because of the supply and demand of the business with ordering parts and promise dates. Co-workers get in moods sometime but the main focus must stay the same the this is business not personal. You have get the vibe sometimes from different people because you may have to approach them differently in professional way of course. The hardest part is dealing with the suppliers if they cannot make a promise date of delivery, the managers think that you were not firm and stern enough with them in order to get your parts. The most enjoyable is the actual entire experience of everything that happens in a give work day."
good,"Reunião de 5minutos de segurança com o time antes de começar o trabalho, destribuição dos serviços a serem executados durante o turno , acompanhar os membros da equipe nas áreas."
good,Dailey work at General Motors was a good day as long as we were able to produce the amount of cars that were expected. I learned that i was happy to be the one building the car than the man who has to repair them. The people i worked with were so much fun. The hardest part of my job was being able to keep up when they turned the line speed up. And the most enjoyable part of my job was working with my co-workers.

good,"For me personally it was a great experience as a mechanical engineering intern. Typical day of work for the majority of my term was, check emails, start work that I had scheduled out for myself (ex. complete mesh fixes for hood (different programs), get certain part of project done, go to meeting, lunch, finish work I had planned, write down what needs to be done for tomorrow (personal thing I had started doing as a reminder) and then time to go home. Work life balance that was outlined by my manager was great, allowed us to manage our own time and trusted us to complete our work.  The environment was constructed to allow individuals to grow in terms of technical ability and also showcase the different achievements or findings they came across to the local team.  My coworkers were always helpful and mindful that I was still developing as a junior CAE, they literally never turned down my need of assistance whether it was for software or a structural assessment for a specific component or work order.  Allowed us to see the physical side of the job (the actual plant where some of the parts were being made was across the street from us), we were shown this on the tour for interns.  Overall the job encouraged growth, doing work you thought would benefit the company and the customer.  Thought it was an amazing intern job. Also a bunch of extra curricular activities like team lunches/team building exercises, as well as larger scale activities like a summer barbecue for the centre or a basketball/foosball tournament."

I was a  coremaker and ran a Loramendi S.A. cold box. The hardest part of the job was learning to run the cold box. I made cores for engine blocks. I also did some heavy processing and work in different areas of the plant. The most enjoyable part of the job, was learning a new set of skills. I also enjoyed meeting and learning about my new co employees."

Over the years you work with many types of people and learn a lot about people. At the same time you can forge some good friendships. Most of management was good to work for and with. With the right attitude you can work with anyone. The hardest part of the job was all the safety requirements. They kept us safe, but it made some of the jobs more cumbersome. I didn't mind all the safety training, because I didn't want to happen to me what I saw happen to others. The most enjoyable part of the job was finishing a job I was given and see everything run smoothly or fit just right."

"
good,"A typical day for me was just what i made it. I never liked to come in running for the clock. Thats makes for head on Stress. When you know your job you can set your pace. One of the most important things that i learned was that i am a people person. Working in plant , with different people, all who have varied personalities , and different values . Learning to work as a Team was very important. If by chance you don't like  (whoever) they don't have to go home with you. But if you have to communicate concerning your job ----GROW_UP---You are here to make a life. Management  is necessary, every one needs a job. I have great respect for those in position, who do what they have to do . Having said that, fairness- and honesty is essential. They should be treated with the same repect that they project. My co-workers and i grew up together---- we had our babies together----we went through the good --the bad--and the ugly.We now have lunch once a month, sometimes its s many as 30 people. Its a good feeling. I believe in working smart----Learn what you are doing-----You will enjoy coming to work----and feel good when you go home."

I was given the responsibly to make decisions on my own. Also, drove fork trucks & high stackers. I was a reliable employee and had a good attendance record. I got along well with salary & hourly employees. I took pride in the work I did for General Motors and was sad to see them leave Anderson."

good,"I never realized how well organized and streamlined GM was until I experienced first-hand the facilities that now produce the overflow of GM's downsizing efforts. It's frustrating to watch tooling being built with no standard guidelines. It's a crying shame to see stamping presses idle because the tool & die departments aren't trained in how to keep parts running. I completed 4 years, 8,000+ hours of training, as an apprentice at GM, then worked as a journeyman until my plant closed. The hardest part of that work: Learning to and troubleshooting production. The most enjoyable: When I worked as a punch finisher."

Somos o tempo todo incentivados. Aprendi quase tudo sobre mecânica, poço dizer que o basico para uso pessoa hoje eu sei e que sendo mulher sei muito mais de que muitos homens sobre mecânica, minha equipe de trabalho é excelente trabalhamos em conjunto e um ajuda o outro sempre, em relação a dificuldade ela existe em relação a lhe dar com clientes e atender prontamente o mesmo, a parte mais agradavel é sem duvida vc ouvir um elogio do seu atendimento por parte do cliente, sendo que o mesmo precisa confiar o seu bem a uma pessoa que ele não esta vendo e não conhece, então a satisfação minha era conseguir ajudar ou orientar o cliente em sua necessidade, isto realmente não tem preço."
good,"This is the place that I had continuous growth with management, education and hands-on experience. A typical day always started with the phones and email (retrieving messages and returning calls) no matter what department I worked in.The majority of my skill sets were developed, groomed, and applied with this company. The hardest part of the job was taking work home with me. The most enjoyable part of the job was having successful events that did not exceed budget constraints."
