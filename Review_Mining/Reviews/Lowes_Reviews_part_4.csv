rating,review
good,A typical day would involve standing at the register dealing with customers on a personal level.
good,A typical work day may start at 5 am or end at 11 pm each leader worked 8 to 10 hour days.
good,"A typical day at work was exhausting. It usually consisted of loading an unloading trucks. Also would drive forklifts regularly through out the day. Answering phones was also a main part of my job. I learned how to persevere even when you are tired. My co-workers were all hard working men. They would always be at work on time and ready to perform. Hardest part of job consisted of the physical labor. Enjoyable part was having the closeness to my co-workers, I felt as though i could count on them at anytime."
good,I am a seasonal employee at Lowes Store 1163 in Memphis Tn. I have enjoyed my experience at Lowes.
good,management is ok
good,Usually a typical day would consist of morning meeting and evening huddles. The whole store had opportunities for every associate. You could learn things in one department that you can extend into other departments. Every associate working in there was friendly and welcoming.
good,pull dackorder and help get the better price on the order and had it rade to pick up in the morrning by 6:00
good,Has oppurtunties to advance in the store. good management and very nice people who patron the stores.
good,great place to work. Work 35 hours per week checking and sacking groceries. off on week-ends.
good,Loved working here and with the people.
good,"I am looking for a Monday-Friday work week, not a retail position."
good,"It's sort of like working in a department store, but with building materials. If you don't know about certain things you're kinda limited when it comes to helping customers."
good,Lowes is a great company to work for. Very flexible with shifts and hours. The management team cares about its employees. Pay is fair and there is room for growth within the company.
good,"Depending on the day or shift I work it can be really steadily busy or really slow depending if it's the colder months. "
good,"The culture is certainly changing with the new CEO and I believe for the better; the ones who don't like it are the ones who've been there for far too long skating through doing the minimum required.  For the most part, the management where I'm at is very good.  Of course there is always drama, but stay out of that and you can go far with this company."
good,"Lowe's feels frantic, but fun. I always had something to do. My managers always led me to do my best. I never missed a break and could always take one if it got too much."
good,"every day is different but you can handle anything that comes your way, the employees there are nice and great to work with. you'll learn a lot about home improvement and what best fits the customer needs. depending on your department you might have to do some heavy lifting for several hours."
good,"A good place to work for the pay I got was good.   Most of the people there were good. They didn't have enough people to cover the jobs they had,  so put more work on us that we couldn't get done."
good,working at lowes was a great time to work there. The manager team help me become the best worker. it was hard in time but it was soo fun to work and pay well
good,They are a good company . Things have changed in the past couple years. But when I worked there it was a fun and positive experience. I would recommend  this job . The one by Costco
good,Lowe's is a great place to work. There are so many different jobs available  at Lowe's. The managers care about your well being and know that you have a life too.
good,Overall it’s a great company to work for. They have an awesome vision benefits. Offer training classes and schooling. 401k is a decent match. I’d recommend working for Lowe’s
good,"Enjoyed working and especially spending time with co-workers. The people there made all the difference. The money wasn't great, but I was in school so the extra work helped out."
good,Nice atmosphere. Family and pet friendly. Understanding management team. Flexible schedule. Management is helpful and shows empire appreciation. Very nice place to work.
good,"again enjoyed working with people and management.  Sometimes "
good,They always keep you busy and you do many different things through out the day. The co workers are great and the managers are usually flexible with your schedule if you give them enough time in advance.
good,I would strongly recommend this company to others. The management does go out of their way to ensure the employees are happy and well as the customers.
good,"Everything is really great, except the management is kinda bad. Because I got injured there, went to see Doctor, found out that my rotor cuff in my right shoulder was torn and had to wear brace. But I got Doctor's note saying I could go back to work in few days, so I brought it there, gave it to my manager there. And I went to work on the day Doctor said I could, so when I got there, the manager sent me home, took me off schedule for a week or 2 weeks. Then after that, I received nothing, so I resigned from that place because I was already completely healed and wanted to work, but they refused to let me work. The only reason why rotor cuff was torn is because I had to assembly heavy things and I never got any help on lifting them. Even when I asked for a help but it never came. But other than that, the hours was great, the money was good, nice people to work with."
good,I enjoyed My time only issue was pay wasn’t high enough to pay my bills. I enjoyed The people I worked with and my manager. Good starting job for young people starting out
good,"I am very happy where I work, management acknowledges when you go above expectations, training is always available if one wants it, and coworkers are supportive too. My previous place of employment left me very, very unhappy; from management showing blatant favoritism to a corporation who is out of touch with their employees. No benefits were offered until you had been employed a year, and then it was pay for it all yourself. I have benefits for my dogs, not just myself. They also offer more types of benefits, like access to a lawyer and more! And it is affordable! Pretax 401k, and all benefits are automatically taken out of your paycheck, so you don't have to worry about it. After 1 year, you can become a stockholder!  Lowe's cares about the people who work for them, at least at my location. I hope I never feel differently about them. All the management are great, surprisingly they actually care about the employees. Blessed to be there."
good,"Overall sales and service experience it was great I could complain we worked to get her as a team to get all the goals met as well as meet out customer need ..."
good,"I have learned at lot about the customers that I served in this position.  This was a great experience.  Meet lits of wonderful people, who I was able to help with their home improvement."
good,I had a lot of management experience with similar companies like Lowes but started off at the part time level and very quickly caught on to the procedures at lowes and moved up quickly.
good,Always learned something new everyday talking to contractors that would come in need in ng supplies. Thoroughly enjoyed the guys I work with. Management was a little difficult but still reliable. Good place to work
good,Overall a great job experience. Every store is different. I worked for three different locations and the store manager sets the tone. The best manager I ever had never asked me to do anything she wasn't willing to do herself. I was able to learn a lot about the materials/merchandise and that has benefitted my career today. Mandatory open availability and the reconstruction of positions within the company are a turn off.
good,Excellent work environment with great benefits and pay. Hiring team and managment perfer straight forward and honest opinions. I appreciate working for a company like that.
good,I have a real zeal for decorating and organizing.  It’s very important to help clients and listen to them.  I spent a great deal of time making sure every element of their design was cohesive and functional.
good,Make sure to be honest and always take the assessment. Work hard and show passion for the position you apply for. Use Smart customer service and abide by all guidelines set forth by management.
good,"I chose to work at Lowes partime while I worked another job to have more income for my family. It was a great environment,  and you meet a lot of new people each day. It's easy to get along with the regular customers. They almost become like family , and you get to help them fix up their dream home."
good,"Short staffed and long hours, but over all a good place to work. Being a me to multi task will help you to do well in this job. Benefit are great and the pay is fair."
good,I loved all of my coworkers regular and new customers. I would never have left this job but we moved to the mountains.  Given the opportunity I would go back to work at lowes as soon as possible!
good,"Enjoyed working for the right manager, who kept assistant managers following the same lead.  After leaving have heard the manager has been moved and many assistant managers changed.  Few of my co-workers are still there, and the ones there are no longer feel as good about working there.  We had a team of 85 good workers who worked well together and were happy to be there.  Times have changed.  I doubt that I would consider working at this store again because of the changes."
good,"Overall, the biggest benefit of working for lowes is compensation and benefits. The company offers numerous benefits including stock options, which many people participate and benefit from."
good,"The work space feels like welcoming and warm environment for meaningful work. The employees always have a smile and all of us here feel like a family. Each day is a task in itself, but the people is what I look forward to every morning before my shift."
good,Personally never worked at Lowe's but I did work at Lowe's grocery store here in Albuquerque New Mexico...I would love to experience this kind of work in hardware
good,"My specialty manager started at the bottom and worked his way up, he never forgot what it was like to be me.  He is very knowledgeable and helpful, he helped make me a success!   One of the best bosses I have ever had in over 40 years of working full time.  They could use work on the hours and schedules, we have families too!  It is retail, but it can work.  Full-time/long-term associates should not work around the part-timers.  Good benefits!"
good,"Great company, great benefits, good life work balance. Management is fair. Typical day consist of a lot of customer service helping customers solve merchandise decisions, cold calling, managing accounts."
good,Typical day is 7-4.  The hardest part of this job is working with the younger generations that Lowe's tends to hire.  It's the their fault it's just young people don't seem to care.
good,Very nice place to work I was on the unload crew and it was fast paced but not terrible very nice people very well managed very relaxed stressful at times but other than that I had the honor to work for them.
good,"This career would have been a good opportunity to learn and advance in a business setting. Offered many departments to have stability in, fun work environment, active work environment,"
good,I started as a seasonal employee while in college and I loved it. They worked around my schedule and offered me fairly to good hours. I was eventually offered a permanent position and loved it.
good,I enjoyed the teamwork atmosphere from the Department management. Anytime I needed work referencing they were available. I will in the future reapply at Lowe's.
good,"Yes, it was a great job, loving people, learn something new everyday about how I could improve my house. Also how to help someone else improve their home and that made me feel good just to make someone else's day better."
good,"A fantastic group of people to work with! Lowe's has vision insurance, dental insurance, health care plans, 401 K, and an employee discount. Also, has an Employee Relief Fund to help employees in times of need."
good,Lowe's is a great place to work at. I like my co-workers. I love my pay. They have a lot of opportunities for you to grow. Lowe's have a great benefits package.
good,"Lowe's provides a decent work load without being too stressful or cause any issues beyond standard customer inquiries. I enjoyed my time working as a cashier and a loader in different areas of the front end, customer service and garden."
good,The emphasis on safety makes lowes a great place to work. They make sure you are 100 percent comfortable before they put you on the floor. Great environment.
good,"I love working with my coworkers and it's a good place to learn about home Improvement , the customer are the best. Lowe's is nice place to work I mean work"
good,It’s not a bad job it’s mostly the people who are their come in do your job and then leave I don’t think you should be able to work at Lowe’s so you can have peace and quite.
good,Great Company going through lots of changes. Very difficult for associates who have given their entire career to Lowe's. And can not adapt to the changes.
good,"Pay is better than most retail jobs, management is fair and nice, dress code is great, and benefits are very good.  Part time benefits are offered too."
good,"Co-workers were great, got along with management. Spent my days stocking and down stocking shelves. I learned how to run forklifts and other equipment."
good,"Lowe’s Is a great place to work, very fast paced! Lots of new upgrades and expectations . Great benefits, good pay, great people to work for. The environment is also good, you get to meet new people and have impacts on their lives"
good,Great experience with Lowe's . Felt like a second family working thier. All leads in department were easy to work with. Would love to go back and work for them.
good,lowes is a good job and I have no complaints about it. the pay was very worth the job and the managers are very nice caring and understanding about family and personal needs.
good,"Great place to work. I loved my job very much. There was alot of training coming in because there is so much to learn. Was told.by a store manager not to worry because you can be here for 5yrs and still not know everything. New CEO has been doing massive changes since he came on board in 2018. The job is secure, but won't know till changes are done. Fun job. Loved my mentor/manager for my department. Loved all the management team. If you just work, you can have a great time working there. People don't understand the concept of work these days so they complain and call out making the job harder for others."
good,This was a fun job. I loved it here but physically its challanging. It great company to work for and look forward to doing business with them in thebfuture
good,"Lowe's Canada (RONA) is a great company in renovations here in North America."
good,"I loved all the people that I worked with. Pay was 13.75 per hour in Portland, OR. The work is fun but it can be hard on your body - there is lots of heavy lifting! I'm a small lady so I would have to ask for help with some heavy items and everyone was very nice about it."
good,Only worked 8 months for lowes. During that time I enjoyed it. Started out working freight team. After that I moved to csa on the sales floor. Would definitely recommend working at lowes.
good,Great place to work. Lots of opportunity. There is a real sense that we are in this together. You will need to have a good work ethic and enjoy customer interactions.
good,"Your more than just an employee. You are family.  However the 55 hour work weeks can be very tiring, but the way the days off are structured helps ease the stress."
good,Dependimng on your management culture most Lowes Stores are a happy place to work. They do at time have stressful situations with non compliant or unhappy customers. Staff is friendly
good,"Always Busy, something to do. Learned customer service, sales and multitasking. Management was pretty hands on. Customer focused culture. The hardest part of the job was restocking and keeping isles neat and clean. Best part of the job was making the customers happy."
good,I loved working here my managers are amazing . I have grown a lot from this place. You have multiple chances to learn different departments and if you are in trade school for plumbing or electric this is a good place to learn!!!
good,I was all over I was a great worker and good with the customers.. it was just bad management and they didn’t know how to communicate with there employees
good,Being at a register or a counter cashing some one out or returning something and u have the urge to use the restroom u cant just leave u got to wait and it could be a while because half the t ime u have to call them and tell them to hurry pls
good,"I absolutely love working at Lowes as a cashier. Working at Lowes has taught me a lot , weather its with customers or the cash register, you meet a lot of different personalities and learn how to co exist. Its a great place to grow and gain experience for future careers."
good,"Great place to get work experience, and the overall work culture is good. "
good,"Working for LOWES has taught me other needs that people in the community need other than health care. Also how we make a difference in their Home Life. As a new resident of Orlando, Florida it's given me the opportunity to meet new people and explore new sub-cities."
good,Lowe's is a very face paced customer oriented workplace. The number one goal is customer service. You should be prepared by gaining product knowledge.
good,Basic customer service using home improvement know-how. Daily responsibilities include stocking merchandise and helping customers. Occasional PK training.
good,"when  I started it was very family oriented and a great balance of home and work. however it did not stay that way, things were promised and never happened. all of a sudden my children didn't matter and I worked over 70hrs a week. there was not a balance of any kind in my life."
good,"Lowes is a great place to work, they very understanding when it comes to the job helpful if you need willing to work around your schedule give you far breaks."
good,"The head managers and persons are great they just needed to manage the store a little differently. The employees are good, never had any problems from them."
good,Ok place to work would recommend good environment. Room for advancement and flexible worki schedule. Work with you if you need it . Management lakes a little bit they are definitely getting better
good,"As seasonal employee,with a variable shift and scheduled days it was very enjoyable. Management almost always worked with employees and each other on various projects.The store and company culture was one of safety first second and last. one of the nicest things about the company was the rewards for keeping the safe workplace was the barbecues. these barbecues were also held on federal holidays with open invitation to employees who were not scheduled that day. For me the hardest parts of the job were getting in and out of customer pickup trucks when doing larger loads, and lifting the hundred plus pound bags of potting mix."
good,"Great Company! Lots of opportunity to grow, learn, and to make your self an asset. Hard work gets noticed, acknowledged, and promoted. The benefits are incredible too!"
good,"This store is one of the best Lowe's stores to work at in the region. The employees are stellar and act as a family. No matter your disability, race, gender, etc, they are welcoming and accepting. People there genuinely get to know you and its a really engaged working environment. I enjoy working here, I just have to find something with better pay (though the pay is still good), and more opportunity for advancement in my life goals and career goals."
good,"Worked as cashier part time, helped in lumber registers, garden registers, and middle store registers depending on the day.  Only some days of the week were always busy."
good,Good place to work. All employees are very respectful. The hours are very decent. Most of the work that you'll have to do is simple and for the most part easy going.
good,"Love working here, just not okay with working all holidays and no holiday pay. They are great people and will help you advance, the retail life just was not for me."
good,"Perfect for a starter job, or for someone who's in school. They work around your schedule. The atmosphere was fun, coworkers amazing in the 4 years I was there it felt like family."
good,"I do like working at Lowe’s but the management has gotten out of control and it’s just not as good of a place to work when I first started. I mostly enjoyed meeting new people, there were a few that weren’t very nice but you just have to brush those customers off your shoulders."
good,it was a temporary job. i wish i worked more days.Although the management was some days stressful but well. that was part of the job.i can recommend it o anyone. nice pay
good,"I truly enjoyed my time with Lowe's, and i would gladly work there again. The Lowe's I worked at was new, and the management was pulled for a variety of locations which allowed for a positive diversity within the workplace. The upper management was exactly the type of management any employee wishes to work for."
good,"If you love busy time and the fast pace of retail, then Lowe's is for you. Fast paced, multi-tasking and team work is the road map for getting it done! Great place to utilize interpersonal skills in service of our customers."
good,Most employees are friendly and they do have fun parties though out the year. They give you 2 weeks vacation when you are hired full time plus 5 paid holidays that can be used through the year. They give you Thanksgiving and Christmas off with pay.
good,Lowe's is by far my favorite store to work at! Everyone was kind and understanding. They take the time out to make sure you're completely comfortable with your job and how to do your job. Customers we're always positive and fun and I would always look forward to going to work everyday!
good,"Easy job to do, mandatory and voluntary overtime, different options for shift, they raise every 6 month. we share in different activities in and outside of work."
good,"Lowes has been great to work for. The insurance is good and the vision coverage is amazing! They helped pay for my college degree. The best part of the job is the coworkers. "
good,"I looked up orders on the computer printed out management sheets and set them up to be delivered"
good,Great company overall learned multiple skills while working there lots of trade skills that come in handy in life. Got to learn how to operate the forklift and order picker and reach lift.
good,"lo mejor de lowes es que puedes cambiar la vida el cliente con una Buena asesoria de compra."
good,"Cutting Lumber"
good,"Lowes will support the advancement of your career if you put in the effort and approach work with a positive attitude. I worked at 3 different stores over a 5 year period of time (only making moves to have a shorter drive to work). When the PSI program ended, I moved to a new Lowes location which was even closer to home and provided a nice career opportunity as Department Supervisor over Electrical and Plumbing. The store management is making great efforts to bring me along into an Assistant Manager position. That kind of support show Lowes to be a Great company. When the employee makes the effort, Lowes is there to provide the support they need."
good,"As much as I enjoy working at Lowes, I don’t have as much as of a set schedule as I would have though. I get called in at night to come in at 4am or days that I was supposed to come in but I was never notified in any way."
good,"It was great working at Lowes people are friendly, hours are flexible, raises could be better. Loved working with customers and management was very cooperative and understanding."
good,"When I was working for Lowes, Hurrican Harvey had just hit. The workload was very heavy, so the company brought in other people. During this time we would also get bonuses on our checks if we worked over a certain amount of hours. "
good,"You clock in, do your job you have a nice amount of paid breaks except for lunch, which is always a hour!  You learn how to work with difficult customers and resolve complaints and issues! Lowes hire a lot of different and unique people with different accents, they are always polite. The hardest part of the job was standing for hours with a few customers you get bored fast! But when it picks up its fast and fulfilling. The most enjoyable part of the job was coworkers that made you laugh or asked you to smile! My department closed down, which was the only reason I left."
good,"Working at Lowe’s home improvement for nearly a year has taught me a lot about what I can adapt to. I learned to manage the front end, advanced my computer skills, and excel my customer service skills."
good,"Great job, co-workers are always willing to help you learn. Flexible with hours. Will help you learn new tasks, and you can always go online to learn something new, they encourage it"
good,"I'm a Customer Service sales associate and my job is to help customers meet their needs when they physically come to the store, answer phone calls, process online orders, and assist customers in returning merchandise."
good,Lowe's as a company is great to work for. The Lake Worth TX store is horrible they need to fire the hr manager and store manager. I recommend Lowe's to people just not that store.
good,I really enjoyed not just working under management but the job environment overall. I woul;d have loved to stay part time but the new job requirement was full time and the hours didn't work well with each other
good,Lowe's provides a good culture and they do focus on the empolyee's work life experience. The leadership is very helpful and many of the  workers have been their for a long time. I was able to move up in management within 9 months of working there.
good,"Hard work is rewarding ,"
good,Lowe's gives you the tools to better yourself in not only work but on a personal level. The management staff cares about the employees like family. Everyday you learn something new and exciting. Working with the public is also a plus.
good,this job taught me how to assess customer needs in regards to their homes and to operate multiple forms of power equipment. Managers were flexible with scheduling requests and attentive to customer and employee needs
good,"If they could pay me more than what I make now I will go back, I really enjoyed working there. Nice and friendly environment. The only thing I didn't like was working 4 hours a day"
good,"Good dependable work. Competitive pay. Not a bad place to work. They offer 10 hours days shift, 10 hour night shift or 12 hour day weekend shifts. Its a wear house so temps are not controlled but are not extreme. They do give out tee shirts and have catered lunches when goals have been meet. Time off through vacation and floating holidays are good."
good,"I have worked at two locations in two different states. The first location was amazing, however the second location I worked at was not as well managed or put together as the first Lowe's I worked at."
good,It is nice working there because they have an open ear policy that allows concerns to be freely mentioned to management. They also have a decent policy on making their employees feel important.
good,Great working experience with great working people. Work was very manageable and fun as well. It was simply a great experience and I am grateful for it.
good,Lowe's has a great work environment and excellent management. It is challenging but fulfilling. I learned how to be pushed independently but work in a team setting. It offers excellent development opportunities and upward mobility.
good,"Good place to work. Nice benefits, caring managers. Flexible scheduling and the store is well managed like an oiled machine. Only wish I could get more hours."
good,"Good place to work , less than 1000 employees when i joined them, unlimited access to senior staff.  Later  co "
good,Lowe's is overall equal opportunity place to work and always has places where employees can grow and start a career. Management is easy to get by applying for the position.
good,Lied working for Lowe’s but some new management wanted to push the power button. Trying to overpower people an using their job to get things done. Several times was told me job was at stake if things were not done
good,"Typical day can be very busy, co-workers all pitch in to make things run smoothly and to ensure customer satisfaction.  I started as the Receiving Clerk and have been promoted to the Back End Manager and oversee over 8 employees"
good,Lowe’s was alright a warehouse job non the less and I got to learn customer service and how to be nice to customers even when they was rude to me I sat there and still took my time to help my customer
good,I work in the installed sales department.  The hours are great.  Latest shift is 9 - 6 and only work every third weekend.  Employees and management are great.
good,"A typical day on the job was meeting new customers"
good,Be on time and have a great performance at the work place.Follow order as they was giving to you in timing fashion.Be honest and loyalty to the company
good,"Upon being hired at Lowes I was very thankful and had many opportunities to grow within the 7 years of working there. I do believe the store manager was disengaged with her staff, but that was made up by the incredible assistant managers she had working with her. In the 7 years, I was able to work in several departments, learn many skills, and grow as a person."
good,Very good place to work. Great management. Great benefits. Good balance between work and family. Always willing to work with your schedule. Good overall atmosphere.
good,"loved my job as PSI, a project specialist for interiors or better known as interior designer and interior project manager. Company has decided to change install scope and end PSI program, hopefully for the benefit of customers."
good,I was let go unfairly and wished I was still there. Worked for a total over 16 years. It's a company that does well by treating its employees fairly most of the time. I would write more but its still a soar subject for me.
good,8 years and got taken out by reduction in my department. Went through multiple stores and was willing to move. Unfortunately for me any position i take within the company at this point would be too large of a pay cut. I have no choice but to leave and take severance.
good,"My day at Lowe's consists of helping customers with appliance questions and purchases. Also answering phone calls when customer call into the department. I have learned great communication and customer service skills, also great attention to detail. Culturally Lowe's is a mix of customer interactions and employee interactions to help the customer love where they live. The hardest part of my job is product knowledge in departments I do not work in. My favorite part of working at Lowe's is the customer interactions and working with my fellow employees."
good,I enjoyed working at lowes. All friendly co workers an managers! It was some days a fast work pace some days were slower. I really enjoyed it! I learned things about doors an windows I didn't know. The hardest part was getting a big window and door down from the top shelf. Management was nice an fair.
good,"Try to go for full Time part time hours are 24hrs max a week. In two weeks I’ve made the most of 46 hours, and they cut hours during slow times. I’ve had a week where I work 2 days 5hour shifts each."
good,Fast paced work environment with a good work/life balance. Competitive pay and better than average benefits. Clear path to advancement with online training to assist.
good,"Needed to relocate, but enjoyed the company. The pay is good for the jobs they make you do. Management is good, Co-workers are pretty decent, and its overall a good place to work."
good,Loved working with this company. Most co-workers were a joy to work with and made many good friends while there. Learned a great deal about the national retail consumer goods industry that helped me transition into my next career.
good,There’s many opportunities at Lowe’s for everyone therefore you have to learn a lot and be able to mange your time willing to cross train around the store
good,Great company to work for. They are very focused on employee development and success. Lowes offers great compensation on top of the ability to advance in the company.
good,"I was injured on the job and as soon as I saw a doctor and the injury was confirmed, Lowes wanted nothing to do with me.  The store manager made up a story about how he thought I injured my shoulder, even though the incident was on video tape.  I was forced to go to mediation for the cost of my surgery and as soon as we reached an agreement, I was told they would only honor the agreement if it included my immediate resignation.  I wasn't even allowed to have the surgery and try to return to work."
good,Looking for better opportunities but good place to work and good people. My coworkers our very helpful and bring great customer service. Fast pace while working on the freight team.
good,I highly enjoyed and recommend this company to anyone wanting to build their skills in this kind of sales. Outdoor Lawn and Garden center was challenging at times with customer demand but was highly physical and busy and always changing the environment kept me on my toes and ready for anything. We had fun and yet we were safe and had a great team to assist with the public’s needs.
good,had fun at my job. love being a person that love my job. there was no part of my job that was hard.am not working at this time but will love to came back to lowe's and work.
good,"After working for Lowes for 5 years. Your co-workers grow on you, more like a family. If there is something you don't know there is always someone that will gladly teach you the process/ropes. There are several pot luck and a time for unity. Make the best with memories when you have your tough days."
good,A work day was fast paced in my dept.I learned alot about handleing customers who were already difficult.the weather was very hot and humid.I built great future relationships.
good,"Honestly, Lowe's has reduced hourly workers to the point where staffing is inconsistent with the requirements of their segment.  Customers in home improvement need a lot of attention, but hourly staff must task rather than focus on the customer.  Lowe's says the right things about customer first, but the lack of staffing means that everyone (including management) mouths the corporate line while interacting with the customer as little as possible."
good,Great company with a sound work environment great for personal growth. Plenty of opportunities to learn new things which are all applicable in life which is great.
good,Lowe's is a good place to work. They take care of their employees as well as their customers. It's a very friendly environment. Working there is a pleasure and is rarely stressful.
good,Good place to work.  Stock and refill the floor and keep overstock organized and neat.  Work as a team on some projects.  I would recommend working there.
good,Lowe's Home Improvement provides excellent training. Training in all areas of your job responsibilities is provided through on-line training. You are also assigned a mentor.
good,Lowes was a great place to work.  I really enjoyed it and was sad that I had to quit because of my knees.  The management is fair and the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting different people all day long.
good,You are working with a great group of guys. Everyone is out to help each other stock the store and do other task that are required of us. The workers made the time of the shifts bearable and enjoying.
good,"it was a great working environment. I really enjoyed working there, the coworkers are great & friendly. The Store Manager it a friendly and genuinely cares abut his employees."
good,Lowes was relaxed and fun. it was a fast paced work environment but easy to learn. I worked on the night crew so a uniform was not pushed on us as much as people who worked during the day
good,Everybody in this company are treated like family not like coworkers. My most enjoyable time at Lowes is all the event we do to help our community. There really is no hard part of the day at lowes.
good,"Lowe's is all about team work and helping customers love where they live. That's the best part of this job, servicing customers and helping them start and finish a project."
good,"I worked at three different lowes locations over a few year span. I worked my way up as one of the most successful flooring managers in my district at a young age. I seriously loved this job. I had some mental health stuff that made me quit abruptly. I wish I could join the company again because I really enjoyed it."
good,"I learned a ton of new skills that I never thought I would learn. It was a fun but productive work environment. The employees are nothing but nice, the management is for the most part good. They were super flexible and understanding of my schedule. I really loved working here!"
good,I had a great opportunity starting a career at this job and really learned a lot and would work for this company again if I could I loved my job and thought I could retire from there one day but life had different plans
good,"For anyone who can count simply and do minor cleaning tasks this job is a complete breeze. Friendly coworkers, determined customers, and easy going management make this job awesome."
good,"got the opportunity to serve my community, learned how to assist my customers, how to find product, how to set up product to be picked up/ delivered, take order"
good,Working for Lowes was an overall rewarding experience. I learned a lot of different life long skills as they relate to dealing with people first hand.
good,People are the Best part of Lowe's and there training. The opportunities are vast for moving into Management. Working with Most up to date Computers systems and training of the new programs.
good,Lowes can be a fun place to work. The associates and customers typically build a great working relationship and that makes it a fun environment. The managers value their employees and believe in servant leadership.
good,Not a bad place to work rem its retail sooo it come with all that pay is good but not everyone knows how to preform there job well...which mean a lot of extra work for you to do
good,"My typical day as a cashier was mostly just ringing people up, doing general cleaning duties, filling the soda coolers, and pushing carts. You learn a lot about tools and different kinds of projects while working for Lowe's. The management there is really nice and generally backs you up when dealing with customers. Everyone is usually pretty easy to get along with, which makes for a great work environment. I'd say the hardest part of the job is all of the heavy lifting. We have to scan every single item (they really discourage us from using the quantity feature). So, if you're on a lifting restriction, this probably isn't the job for you. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help the veterans. Lowe's actually does the veteran's discount, unlike most of the retail businesses that I've worked for!"
good,"After filling out the online application and showing up for the job fair, Lowe's often hires on the spot and asks you what department you would like to work in; I started out as seasonal help in Outdoor Lawn and Garden and enjoyed it very much, very physical work. Most demanding thing is working in extreme temperatures and helping customers while learning the product. I knew very little about all the different kinds flowers and plants before working there but you learn a lot on the job. Management works with you if you're a good worker and will help you stay on after the seasonal work ends if you're interested and are a good worker. The most enjoyable part of the job was being outside in the sunshine and learning all the flowers, plants, shrubs, & bushes. For the tons of questions you get by customers on where something is in the store, there is a Lowe's app that is very helpful, although wi-fi does go in and out quite a bit and is a little frustrating. Otherwise, overall, good experience working outside. Inside store dynamics are a little different."
good,"Some of the management is cold and uncaring, but there is some amazing managers there as well. The pay and benefits are amazing. I enjoyed my overall experience there."
good,"working in the garden center assisting customers was my typical day."
good,Great place to work. Too many managers not enough workers. Won't work with students on scheduling.must be available all hours of the day til eleven at night
good,"Its a great company, some managers shouldnt be in a management position. I got along good with my co workers.. I like working outside and doing what I waa doing.. Lowes pays good too"
good,"Greeting customers as they entered store, resolved any problems the customer may have had.   scheduled lunches and breaks for all front end associates.   worked closely with management staff to schedule delivery's  and customer pickups, as well as customer issues."
good,Lowes is a good paying job for any college student because they do work with your school schedule long as they know your availability. Lots of nice people work there and its really a team player work place because everyone works together to get things done there.
good,"Lowe’s is a great place to start a career. Despite the fact that it’s retail, you’re always able to grow and move up in the company. I would consider Lowe’s a tremendously great retail business for today’s  society."
good,While working here i have been welcomed into the Lowe's family. They make the schedule adjust to the epmloyee needs as well as properly inspiring employees to be theyre best. Truly a wonderful experience of working here
good,Friendly well more as a family instead of a team that depends on one another for everyone to perform their best at their duties while for working for this company.
good,"The job keeps you on your toes, there is always something do or a customer to help. Pay is good with decent benefits.  I've been working for Lowe's for a long time and have enjoyed the people and environment."
good,I enjoyed my time working at Lowes. My Department was Indoor Lawn and Garden and I knew my topic. Lowes has a great training program and they make sure you are ready to work. Great Atmosphere!!!!
good,"On a normal day I`d come in around 9pm(I was night stock), we`d go through a meeting to see what everyone was doing that night(assuming we didn't have a truck or something was different about that night), I stocked paint and chemicals, if I finished early I`d help other people with their stocking. There was no dress code so I wore what I wanted. The people I worked with were great everyone got along well and would consider them friends. The hardest part about the job for me was the height, I don`t like going to really high places and the shelves are pretty tall, I did it but it took me awhile to finish cause I was honestly terrified. The most enjoyable part of the job was just nobody bothered me while I was working and if it was it was just a joke here or there all in good fun, I listed to my talk shows and did my job and went home."
good,Very good and productive workplace during my time at lowes home improvement. Picked up new skill sets such as machinery labeling and digital iphone usage for the store
good,Lowe's is very relaxed and is an easy job for someone in college due to flexible scheduling. Overtime is only allowed in March-late May. Sometimes very short-staffed.
good,"It was a good place to work just my family needs need to be first.We had MS challenge and I got top in two years, They cook out in summer about once everyweek, Breakfast brought in for our 3 month meetings"
good,"Store managers are great, supportive. disconnect occurs one level up with market (district) management. Worse at regional level. Great workplace if you like working with people (staff and customers). Pay is at level with similar sized retailers. Great training programs using a balance of internet and hands-on. As a manager you open and review financial store reports. Hold staff meetings in daily huddle or individually in aisles to set daily goals. Good mix of being proactive as well as reactive in day-to-day business. When closing you coordinate downstocking and department recovery to assist in next day's business."
good,"It’s a good place to work but you’re not going to move anywhere in the company without hardcore brown-nosing. Your work ethic, education, skill set, and knowledge do not guarantee your advancement at this company. However, this is, by far, the easiest job that you can have. It’s very laid back, they truly take care of their employees and are a huge family. You can be there a short time and be taken in to the Lowes culture. If you’re looking for an easy job with modest earnings and a great atmosphere, then Lowes is a good place to go. "
good,"My favorite job.. team oriented branch was efficient, friendly, and productive... Almost all managers were pleasant and accommodating.. learned a lot from my immediate supervisor"
good,"Good place to work part time, if you are looking to do other jobs they will work with your schedule to make sure you are available for the other job.."
good,There were many people that were nice and made it worth working there but the store manager at the one i worked as was a nightmare and didn't know how to balance the work place.
good,"When i worked there the head cashiers were not the very nicest and did not really want to teach anyone anything, and they played favorits a lot so if they did not like you then you werent going any where quickly"
good,This job was a pleasant experience due to the welcoming nature of the staff and management. Most task seem pretty clear cut and help was always available when I needed it. It was  great job for someone without a lot of experience and I provided a variety of skills training.
good,"Started out good, sometimes got out of hand at customer service. Or when certain people lack of skill and you have to primarily fix their mistakes. Besides that left with a smile on your face."
good,"The management was great as in if i needed extra hours to get by at the end of the month, all i had to do was ask! My coworkers were fun to work with."
good,most other employees are friendly and professional but with all companies there are a few that make it difficult. the work environment is a positive one and made you want to be there and do your best.
good,"I enjoyed working for Lowe’s D.C. the environment was very laid-back and casual. As long as you did what you were assigned to do supervisors didn’t ever bother you, which I liked. They also have a great cafeteria and definitely have great trainees as well as training that IS paid for!"
good,This is a great place to work but not many opportunities go to dependable employees. Teamwork is great when you have the luxury. Goals are not always met which brings down some moral.
good,"ever changing, fun customers and coworkers, great place to learn customer service skills, so many things to learn in this place, winter can be hard for a part timer but summer is a blast"
good,"I really enjoyed working at Lowes Corporate Call Center. The supervisors try to keep it fun, and do a lot of challenges that motivate you if your willing to put some effort in it. I also hear they have bonuses now, and that was implemented after I left."
good,I enjoy working here it is fun they offer great opportunities. fast paced on weekends. learning product and store is fun.  Lowe's has been by far the best company i have ever worked for
good,"Productive and fun place to work. Enjoyed it and would have stayed but they laid people off and I was one. Good culture, learned a lot."
good,Great opportunity for advancement for those that are willing to put in the work.  Must be able to learn fast.  Not much training involved.  You learn on the fly but are provided many resources to gather the information needed to help your customers.
good,The overall experience with lowes was good. Most management well you know. good benefits and 401K plan. Schedule was in predictable but you know that before you start.
good,"Some management had no business in that role while other management turns a blind eye.  It became like high school and drama. Used to ""love where I live""."
good,Lowes is a wonderful place to work. It’s a busy fast paced place to be. Most people there are willing to help and advise others in any way possible. Great opportunities for advancement and different kinds of work.
good,"was a quick pace enviroment. Needed to keep on your toes and moving constantly to keep up at times. Some days it was not busy, but the weekends was usually the bussiest."
good,"Great place to work, have to go to find work some days, but most people are team oriented. The corporate culture could be better, but it depends on the store and you as an individual. Some days feel like you are helping others get what they want as a customer, knowing on the pay scale give you could not afford such things."
good,I love what I do special order products for customer and educated customer about the product before place the order. I love cutting blinds for customers. I have never had a hard day at work because I make my job easy to do.
good,"This is a great place to work. The team is great, customers are great, it's an all around good experience. Would go back and work for them any day...."
good,"This job was fun and exhilarating.  I really enjoyed working with people and helping them design a lighting and or ceiling fan application."
good,"This company has high expectations but demonstrates great patience in allowing its associates to progress at their own pace.   There is unmatched support between the departments as everyone is there to lend a hand. The managers are constantly visible and accessible throughout the store and are often literally helping the associates with the task at hand. "
good,Lowe’s was a great place to work. It had a family atmosphere. The management was a little lacking. The work wasn’t hard. If you can’t stand on your feet long this may not be the job for you.
good,I was a CSA-IV  in the Electrical Dept. I did some product ordering and some display building and some resets. I also did cycle counts and I also helped  customer to  every thing in the Lighting and Electrical Departmentt.
good,"Supportive management, friendly collaborative environment, with 75% of associates committed hard working. Antiquated IT system to process estimates, sales, and project management. Incomplete training system. Hiring process inadequate."
good,I have dedicated 5 years to Lowe's I just feel that it's time to move on to bigger and greater things to keep improving my life. You never stop learning there is always a chance to improve and learn new things
good,Great place to work. Happy staff willing to assist the customer needs. Managers that went out of there way to get the job done. Management was very supportive and the training was excellent.
good,Enjoyed the interaction with coworkers and customers. That interaction was the best part of the job. I enjoyed helping people with their projects and liked to see photos of the final product.
good,"Lowes is a great place to work, they offer scheduleing around your hours.  You can have part time and later get full time.    There is also a chance to move up in the store if you prefer.Management team is very  understanding and will work with an employee if they have an issue."
good,"Lowes home improvement has a steady work pace but some days could be very fast paced. As a employee at lowes there wasn't really anything hard about the job. The most enjoyable part of it was the interaction with customers, making a customers day, and being trained on the forklift."
good,I enjoyed working at Lowes.  Its a good atmosphere and the people are very friendly and knowledgeable which made training really easy.  Thwir employee compwnsation could be a tad better.
good,A typical day at Lowes can be either stressful or relaxing but in all a fun productive day. Meeting new people daily is a joy and working well with others can be fun.
good,"Great pay for a retail store. Gives payed vacation, holiday, and sick for full time employees depending on time worked. Full time employees have to have open availability, which does make it difficult to have another job."
good,"unloading company truck, taking freight to their respectable departments, driving hi low, power stocker and stocking company merchandise. Managers are easy to get along with. I also am the head trainer for new employees as apart of the unload team supervisor."

good,This place will keep you on your toes depending on your role. fast paced it is also seasonal. so in the winter times its is slower and they do alot of cuts

good,would like to have.a set schedule so that I can have family/personal time.  I love working with people and the public.  Fast paced business and being on your feet att the time.

good,They saw potential and were willing to work with me with my school. I had a great area manager and zone manager. Great place to work while in college and post college if you want a steady career.
good,Lowe's was a supplemental job that I was still doing Customer Service IT Services. Lowe's was a great place to work with and had some of the nicest co-workers that I ever had. Work was a fun place to go as hectic as it could get. We stuck together as a team and it was a great work balance.
good,Good hourly pay good benefits with ways to invest in company but job is very physical and hard work ...................................................
good,The work was great. Had allot  of customer interaction. Learned how to mix paint for customers needs. Put away freight 3 days a week so we would have plenty of products on the shelves for customers.
good,There is always something to do and plenty to keep anyone busy throughout the year. The people you meet ad the ones you already know are great to be around.
good,"Lowes is Fast paced, demanding customer service. Overall the benefits and family atmosphere are great. Current structure doesn’t provide enough man hour support and makes it difficult to succeed."
good,"rotate schedule was great, work with on scheduling to some degree, over all fun place to work Good customer service is very important to me so the work invironment was conducive to my back ground"
good,"The work is very engaging and fun to work at. There's so much to learn and so many different departments that it's a good learning place, with the bonus if discounts and learning a lot about tools and construction related materials."

good,"Any day of the week can be fast paced. Customer Service is number 1. The customer must always be greeted in a friendly manner. The management at Lowe's is at its best. They strive to make the workplace as friendly as possible. The most difficult part of the job is planning family time, vacations and sports games the kids are in. The best part of the work environment is the diversity Lowe's has to offer"

good,"The people there were amazing, customers and workers alike. The work was fun and fast paced especially on holidays. I learned so much while working there."
good,"My typical day at Lowe's consisted of greeting every employee I walked past and every customer I encountered. I love my job here, however I have reached a cap and feel I cannot climb any longer here. Lowe's has been good to me but I am ready to grow. The hardest part of the job was the learning curve each time I advanced in the company, but that did not last long. My management has changed recently and they are changing employee's hours across the store, including mine, and I simply cannot work the hours they have laid out for me."
good,A typical day a Lowe's in putting up stock before the the store opens. When the store opens you man you department and help customers with what ever project the working on

good,"Lowes was a fun place to work at, the training was pretty easy as well. the typical thing about lowes was that everyday you would work in a different department, which i thought was nice. I learned alot from every deparment and different employees as well. What i found hard about lowes was the process in learning where everything was at like whats in every isle..other than that i worked comfortably and everybody that i worked with was really nice and understanding."
good,"Great Benefits packages, great staff to work with.  Flexible Schedules but could be consuming for weekends and holidays. "
good,"Great Place to work and good benefits"
good,I really enjoys working at Lowes. I have worked in a couple of different depts. I can float between them and work as a cashier. It gives me variety and I really like that.
good,You choose a shift.  All three shifts arent too bad you either have a 3 day weekend or a 4 day weekend and you work 40 hours a week unless there is OT opportunity.  the pay isnt too great but the benefits were good.  Management is real iffy and good luck if you cause an incident.
good,I enjoy the outside power equipment department and especially helping customers with equipment they may bring in or assisting them in sales for new equipment
good,"Work wasn't difficult unless someone didn't show up"
good,"Nice place to work with a great atmosphere. Management is often fair, pay starts ok, 401 k options are real good. All you need toi do is bomb them with your resume and you will be interviewed."

good,Lowe's distribution center was a great company to work for. The work atmosphere was very good despite a few.  I didn't like the very fast pace driving throughout the facility but outside of that it was good.
good,It was a fun place to work. They did try help you if you needed help with a customer you were helping. Schedules were flexible. If you needed a day off they would see what they could do help you.

good,Lowe's is a great company to work for whether you are looking for something permanent or temporary. They offer great benefits and opportunities to advance in the company.
good,The temporary job was early morning stocking and customer service. Lowes has I pods employees use to find different stock in stores which was a major help.
good,Lots of opportunities at Lowe's. Company is willing to train constantly. Very safe oriented. Plenty of benifits and hours. Most positions have great hours and Lowe's is fare with schedule matrix.
good,This job is great for kids going to school and are looking to make a little cash. I think they look more towards kids that are still in school because that's all that I work with most of the time.
good,Always something to learn. Good communication from management to associates. Advancement opportunities for dedicated employees.  I would recommend anyone apply here. Great for people that love to interact with others.
good,"Lowes is constantly working towards keeping up with the trends in retail culture.  Their new motto of ""Helping people love where they live.""  Is a fantastic concept and they do a great job at trying to achieve that in their stores."
good,"Overall very good place to work.  Difficult work/life balance was the hardest.  Wait on customers, evaluate their needs with knowledgeable, professional skill involving a high rate of customer sales and ensuring customer satisfaction with follow up and handling customer concerns.  Multitasking of Inventory duties, floor sales, display maintenance, sales promotions and pricing, daily tracking of customer orders, observing safety policies, creating daily worklists for team and tracking and evaluating team members progress growth and personal development.  Most enjoyable parts of the job were providing WOW customer service, and helping to create a positive work experience for other associates."
good,"An easy work environment altogether, being a cashier is an easy paying job. Customers can get a bit overwhelming but anyone can handle this job.There is room for advancement if you look for it."
good,on a typical day depending on what department I was working in it was a very fast paced atmosphere that I worked in I was on my feet all day and the time seemed to fly right by.
good,"Did stocking and taking care of guests for all of their electrical needs. Always maintaining a clean and safe work environment for customers as well as co-workers. I learned to help residential and contractors with all of their needs. The culture was diverse in Arizona, and one that I truly enjoyed. The hardest part of my job was really nothing. I love to work with people and it was great to help so many get the satisfaction on all of their purchases."
good,I enjoyed working for Lowes and would like to be hired again at another store somewhere.  The culture is great and the attitudes of the managers and staff makes it a pleasure to come to work
good,"I love working with the customer's at Lowe's. The only problem is not having a constant schedule. I love working in the Tool Department. The people, for the most part are good to work with"
good,"there are great benefits however company is very political. People are often moved up due to who favors them. However the benefits at time sout weigh the negative ,"
good,"Great place to start. Loved working for this company. Everyone there was wonderful to be around. Love, love, love! Made lots of lifetime friends. Great job, Lowes!"
good,Lowe's is a Fortune 50 company. It makes you expand your knowledge and can be fast paced. You will have to be available for all hours in a retail position.
good,"Assisted customers with their electrical needs. Helped with lighting, wiring, components for their electrical projects. Many customers needed help with some instruction to make their project complete."

good,"I love working here. The only issue here is not all management are on the same page, you get directed into different ways to do things. Employees are awesome everyone works together. everyone is nice. you need the help with anything this is the place to go."
good,Good place to work. Great place to improve your skills for home improvement. Learn about tools to housing machines. Staff are very professional and respectful.
good,"As an Assembly Technician at Lowe's, I have a rather unique role. I neither receive incoming orders nor do I usually work with customers directly. I have a small workshop in the back of the warehouse, and I like it that way. Most of my days have little to no oversight, and I'm left to my own devices by management. That said, I work very hard. I assemble display and customer orders of whatever hardware and machinery is required. Most commonly in the summer months that's grills, but in the winter its snowblowers, and in between there are tractors, hardware cabinets, wheelbarrows, and so on. I enjoy the freedom my job allows, and I deeply appreciate my manager's trust by letting me work at my own pace. As long as my work is done, management doesn't bother me. The control I have in my job is unprecedented, and I have never before seen such freedom in a job before. I can't speak for the majority of other workers, but my personal experience working at Lowe's has been nothing short of exemplary."
good,"Management was supportive and encouraging to staff.  Work included customer service sales, maintaining accurate documentation, sales lead management and aisle maintenance.  Worked with great people-employees and customers alike."
good,I enjoyed helping the customers with all their needs while in store. My supervisor was very helpful and very knowledgeable. I was able to learn many things while working for Lowe's.
good,I worked at Lowe's for nine years and found it to be a great company with excellent management. I enjoyed many benefits while working there and would recommend it as a potential employer to anyone who asked. I cannot say enough positive things.
good,"My day to day is about the same now that the season is coming to an end. I have learned a lot while working for the company, management could use some improvement but it's not horrible."
good,"I worked there before the restructuring, it was a great place then.  Come to work, do my job, meet great people and go home.  Always left with a satisfaction of helping someone fix a problem."
good,"While there is a lot of physical work at Lowes, (which can take it's toll), but the benefits are great.  This can be a challenging job because it is retail, but most customers are friendly and happy to be working on home improvements.  The other employees for the most part are wonderful people to be with."
good,"Unloading trucks at Lowes is not for everyone. It is hard work but I enjoy it. We are usually short handed which means more work. "
good,"A typical day at work can consist of various task.  Most are self explanatory and common sense.  Ive learned how to deal will all customers need and expectations.  Management can be difficult at time, however I understand their position and I respect it.  The hardest part of my job is dealing with associates who don't work as a team player.  the most enjoyable part is when the voice team puts together fun pot lucks to show their appreciation to the associates who have been working hard."
good,"Productive and fun workplace. Management was very nice and wanted you to succeed, workers were very easy-going and easy to get along with. I learned how to mix paint."
good,"I like working at Lowe''s but I don't have any room for advancement. "
good,"My typical day at work consist of my purpose. Which is making sure that dreams are made and stories are told.Overall, making sure that my customer's are satisfied with my customer service. I really enjoy my job, as the plumbing specialist, especially when a customer leaves with a smile on their face."
good,"I think Lowe's is a great  place to work, they offer many great benefits. However  there really isn't any job security. I was hired in as a department manager and then the company did an organizational change that left me out of my position. I now have a year to take a pay cut and new position within the company or be terminated. Management could be better as well. But hey I guess that is retail. I still think its a nice place to work."
good,I love working here! I am looking to work hours (a day job) which they can not offer which is why I am looking for another job. I love my flooring department and how well we work together to accomplish busy days filled with  a lot of inquiring customers. We are like a huge family to one another!
good,Lowes was an awesome place to work. You are treated very well with many perks such as free icecream monthly. there is a great work-life balance. your supervisor is there for you every step of the way. your co-workers are more like family. the vibe of Lowes was just absolutely great. i would recommend everyone working here.
good,Great vision and dental for part time. Endless chances to advance or transfer. Lots of chances for bonuses as well as training. Has assistance programs and schooling reimbursement.
good,Lowe's is a great company to work for. I would recommend this job for anybody that would like to work in retail. I really enjoyed working here & the benefits are great.
good,"Good over all good people good environment  fast paced work a lot of heavy lifting. But nothing I wasn't expecting. Low wage good benefits, and great management."
good,"I worked for Lowes for two years and it very fun, Lowes does a great job of hiring exceptional employees and the customers you get at the store very nice and proper. Your day can go from being not very busy to absolutely swamped in a matter of minutes. it keep you on your toes."
good,"co workers were very nice, management is flexible with scheduling, everyday was different, I learned something different everyday, pancake Fridays were pretty cool."
good,I overly loved working for lowes and tryed to learn a different field of retail/ home improvement. I was there for awhile and the only reason for me leaving was the management would not cross train there employees in different departments.i like being cross train myself because i like knowing were items were also when a customer ask me can u help me it feels nice when u can take that customers to that item/items
good,"Lowes is a complete package , and most of the co workers are friendly, and always willing to help out. I can only say is a place to be as long as you love your job and want to keep it."
good,"Lowes was a fun place to work because of the interaction with the various customers and different departments.  I enjoyed the Garden Center best as I like the plants, being outdoors and the customer interaction about the different plants and flowers."
good,Lowe's is a great company to work for and they are understanding with my schedule because I am a student. Although I am looking for something else with more opportunities and where others listen to my ideas.
good,"A typical day at work is just to help the customers any way you can, and I do work 10 hour shifts. The hardest part of the job is being on the phone all day long and not really getting to interact with anyone."
good,lowes was a great place to work. people were genuine and would help out any and everyone if they needed help. they honestly cared about the people and never disrespected the customer
good,god place to work but if you are a specialist you all most haveto lie to meet your sales numbers and the store is sales driven and try to get the customer to buy sometnig they dont want to try t meet
good,Lowe's is a great place for anyone to start a career or even just a temporary (seasonal) job. The environment is easy to adjust to and most coworkers are very friendly and willing to help you progress in your knowledge of how the company works. It is very likely to be moved departments due to Lowes being a large corporation with many positions available. My overall experience has been great and still is.
good,"loved working here, great people great environment good management the only problem they are very strict other than that great place to work !!!!!!!!!!!!!"
good,team work was premium. Everyone one got along and finished the tack. It was a pleasure to be part of such a magnificent team.  It was invigorating to accomplish our work each night.
good,"Lowe's was a very good place to work, I enjoyed working there and especially liked helping customers pull their projects together .  I think the hardest part of the job was not having enough help."
good,I worked there for 5 years started as a seasonal outside garden associate moved to inside part time the to psa for 2 years then I became a millwork specelist fo 5 months the a department manager over lumber until the restructuring
good,"As a front end customer service associate, I process payments and returns, ring out customers, answer enquiries on the phone and help out the customers to find what they need.  The people I work with are wonderful and very helpful.  They management is very caring."
good,I have been here for a year and enjoy how well they care about the employees. I like the fact that i am learning about alot of different ways of doing different trades. I enjoy the store manager he is serious one minute and can also be relaxed around you as well.
good,"Lowe's is a great place to work, great co-workers and high energy environment. If you really enjoy home improvement this is definitely the job environment for you."
good,"I need something more challenging. Im dedicated, hardworking, very knowledgeable. I'm open to change, and growth within a company, I am great at tasking in a timely manner and very self driven."
good,I enjoyed my time with lowe's it was a very safety oriented company.  I liked the structured setup of the company.  Great work environment with good people.
good,Hands down the best jobs I have had. I wish to continue one day in the near future my career there. The pay is awesome the work is fun and easy. The environment is over all soothing and laid back.
good,You're always on the go when you work for Lowes. Especially in a call center environment. There's going to be days when it's busy on the move. Of course it tends to be slow in different times of the year
good,"On the whole Lowe's is a great place to work. I have become very close to some of the ones I have been fortunate to work with. They use to accommodate mothers shifts but once new management took over, the new manager wouldn't. Which forced me to leave for I had little ones. Other than that it is a great company to work for. If you love the opportunity to learn different jobs this is a great place to work for."
good,Very enthusiastic work environment . I got to learn from my superiors in many aspects of running a business. Making sure orders are on time. I loved how it's always something to do
good,A very nice place to start a career. I started back in college if you are looking for part time they are very good about schedule conflict and if you are looking for full time perfect place to work.
good,Pay is well. Is a cooperation but each store feels different to work for. They give you vacation time which is great for part-time employees. Which doesn't happen often.
good,"My responsibilities were making sure the customer was taken care of, order products when need ,making schedules , doing general house cleaning .and making sure shelves were filled."
good,I was an unfortunate victim of restructuring. I miss my job and would gladly go back. Lowes is a fun place to work. You build great relationships with your co- workers and customers.
good,Good employer with management that seems to care about people. The teams are managed will with a good ratio of supervisors to members. I enjoy working for Lowe's.
good,I unload trucks and supervise 3 employees. I enjoy that Lowe's trust us to work with little supervision. I've learned how to drive and forklift as well as use a LRT gun. Overall I have no complaints about the company.
good,"loved working here,people are great and anything is possible with job fulfillment. unfortunately my job is no longer needed so I am looking to broadcast knowledge elsewhere"
good,"Excellent environment and amazing employee. Nevertheless, the new company policies and employee structure are terrible and ill-conceived! Whosoever conceptualized this new personnel structure ought to be terminated because they are unfamiliar with the inner-workings of the stores. Moreover, the new personnel structure is grossly inefficient and counterproductive. Virtually all my co-workers including the management team despised the new personnel structure. This is not an improvement but a regression and degeneration."
good,"I worked for this Company for 8 years and Loved it the hours were bad from time to time but overall Good Job."
good,Lowe's is a great place to work depending on location. The leaders of the stores are what makes the job more enjoyable than others.  The company offers great benefits for those who needs it.
good,i perform my duties as its required and everyone out there in the job is really helpful. i learn a lot of networking an skills that will help me in the up coming projects
good,"Good pay, however job security is pretty low as they frequently fire people who have been around for awhile and cut positions. Would recommend for a part time or student job."
good,I have learned a great deal working at Lowe's over the past 17 years. It is fun to work with customers every day. The projects are different and new each day for each customer. Associates are like family. Customers are too. Management is fair with all associates across the board.
good,"I loved my career with Lowe's. I was fortunate enough to advance quickly, thanks to my management team who helped in my success.  Lowe's has a wonderful training program and great people to assist in development of others."
good,I loved my job it got crazy at time but what retail store didn't it made you love the people even more. We worked as a group love that about Lowe's its family orientated.
good,The managers showed concern for all of the employees and cared about what was going on.  If you have an issue they will try to accommodate your schedule around your life schedule.
good,"The wages wasn't the best, but for a 18 year old high school student, they wasn't bad. Management seemed to try their very best to succeed but sometimes they seemed to fall short of expectations."
good,"Lowes runs by the book, treats everyone equally and fairly.  The human resources manager cares about the employees and will go out of the way to ensure issues are dealt with."
good,"great workplace,great team-members ,great place to learn about home improvement and if not still a fortune 500 company is and always will be in my eyes"
good,A very good work place. Advancement in company can be obtained easily. Very open and honest. Definitely a place that gives back to the community.
good,Lowe's is a great place to work. I do feel as though the need for experienced workers is not a necessity to the company anymore. I deal with a lot of customers on a daily basis that are frustrated with the competitors for not having experienced workers.
good,"My first job at lowes was in the Lawn and Garden at a cracker box store in Johnson city.Moved to a bigger new store.Also Lawn and Garden Team Leader.later moved to contract sales,where I became knowledgable in the building supply.By then we were moved to different job positions.I retired in 2001 from the Johnson City.I also went backed to work at the greenville LOwes in 2007 untill 2008. I than married and went to farming and gardening...Now I need a part time job to use up my energy...I love lawn and garden work"
good,Lowes is a great company to work for.  There are opportunities to make it a fantastic place and I do believe they are doing the best job possible for all concerned.  Culture here is the best part.  Family atmosphere in such a large company doesnt really exsist anymore.
good,"supervisor were really nice and helpful, answering incoming calls about repairs, verify customer info add customer  and asset info. transfer customer to the right department. my experience with lowes was great love and enjoy everything, some really nice envrieonment."
good,"Accommodated my school schedule, good benefits, good customer-employee relationships developed, caring supervisors!"
good,"This store is an outstanding place to buy everything needed to fully construct a building from foundation to roof."
good,Lowe's offer a challenging workplace environment that allows for individuals to excel.  The pace is quite fast and there is a large volume of business being done day to day.  There is a great amount of opportunity to utilize strengths and identify weaknesses.  There are fantastic education resources to choose from to further refine ones skills.  The management is always happy to offer support and coaching.  The benefits are fantastic and there is opportunity for advancement.
good,"A regular day being an inside sales associate is, assisting customers with their specific needs, up selling products, using heavy machinery to get down barbecues, riding-lawnmowers, and dining sets."
good,"Lowe's is a large company, they provide home improvement supplies to customers. Lowe's has many employees, they all have responsibilities and get paid for their work."
good,I enjoyed working with lowes. There was always a chance to learn something new. You had a chance to meet and work with many different kinds of people.
good,There is no average day at Lowe's every day is different and every day you learn something new. I was able to hone my customer service skills and learn a variety of skills that I would probably not be exposed to at other establishments. I really enjoyed the customer service portion of this job and the many friendships I had working at this company.
good,Good work environment. Good work life balance good training platforms to enable job success. technology leader in business solutions.
good,"I was a loader, unloader, and all of the jobs invole customer service.It was a very good job. I like interacting with customers."
good,"I joined this Lowes store while in between jobs, expecting it to be a ""stepping stone"". I now have worked here over 9 years. I enjoy the work, and the mandatory no overtime allows me to put in my 40 hours a week and enjoy other things in my life. Lowes is re-structuring and my position will be eliminated at the end of the year"
good,This company is great to work for. Has a lot of growth in this company. The management works with you to help with the steps of moving up in the company. So at the end of it great company
good,Lowes is undergoing a massive change to increase profit by reducing staff.  They are trying to make their stock value keep up with Home Depot by cutting costs.
good,This was a great experience working with Lowes. I have not one regret. I'd apply again for a part-time job if I could. But I will recommend this job for anyone who's interested in working there.
good,"Love helping customers and ordering blinds and shutters for them. Love doing the installs and helping people decorate their homes.Been doing this job for 12 years and have been very satisfied with it. Worked full time for about 9 years and the rest part time.Still working there doing this job. Managers have been great. Learned a great deal while I was here. Worked with many associates from all over the country. Job also consists of cutting in stock blinds, down stocking and keeping the department nice and neat so that it is presentable to our customers.Also helping out on the front end with code 3's."
good,Company is a good place to work.  Good leadership and advancement opportunities.   I have learned a lot about leadership and customer service at this company.
good,"I am glad I am a part of Lowes because I learned a lot. The employees have made me feel so welcomed, and they make the days worth it. I love to help people, and resolve problems and do as much as I can. The hardest part of my job is trying not to get overwhelmed when a lot is thrown at you. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I helped someone with what they needed."
good,This was a great place to work while I was a student in college. The people were very nice to work with as well as upper management.
good,There are a great number of wonderful people who work their hardest to maintain a positive work environment and provide a great service to their customers.
good,"My responsibility at lowes was to stock up items in the flooring section and keep it as neat as possible. I would also help people with questions they have, Lowes provides an excellent training for you so you can be ready to sell items to people. Management wasn't really involved in our flooring section and it was just a mess. Sometimes Ill be working by my self. The most enjoyable part of the work was that I learned about the Material, specific reviews so when I have my house. I will know what to use and what not to use for my floors."
good,"Great, staff ,long hours, fair pay.  Office staff and upper management work hard at running things . They work hard to be fair with vendors and employee staff. Great to work with"
good,"Lowes is a good company to work for, they help you with advancements. Ive learned alot about the maintenance field at this location."
good,"When you arrive each day the people you work with greet you with a smile, and genuinely care about your day.  Management makes the hard days more enjoyable."
good,I love working here. We have such a wonderful environment. All of the employees have a positive attitude and are always ready to work. We always take the extra step to satisfy the customer when we can.
good,Good company with very good training. Management styles vary and differ but no more so than any other company. Be prepared not to miss any time during training.
good,some management isn't the best. but others are great. just depeneds on who. just takes time to get use to it all but not too bad of a place
good,"Great managment. Great people. Bad pay, but very very good job and discounts. I loved the job, just the pay was horrible. I realized that small stores do not get paid as much as big box stores as far as management. Lesson learned."
good,A typical day is based on customer need. Sometimes the days are busy and sometimes the days are slow. All in all you develop relationships with your coworkers and customers that'll turn into life-giving friendships.
good,"A typical day consist of cutting or ordering blinds, helping customers with paint and samples, help with flooring and sometimes plumbing"
good,"I absolutely loved working here. If I hadn't completed my degree in an unrelated field I would have been content staying with this company and continuing to work my way up. I started as a summer seasonal employee with no intention of anything more than a summer job, and ended up staying 3 years and accepting 2 promotions during that time, 1 of which was a management position. If you work hard in this company you will be rewarded with opportunities for advancement. Great work environment with some of the most wonderful people you can meet."
good,Absolutely enjoyed working for lowes! great management and an excellent workspace. I had the chance to acquire new skills through lowes. Only downfall i could say is if you choose to work seasonal do not get your hopes up for staying as a permanent team member no matter how great of a worker you may be. They cannot afford additional hiring through seasonal due to their own company reasons. It is extremely rare but not impossible getting hired on through seasonal. But all in all i must say it's been one of the greatest work experiences i have had the honor to be involved in.
good,i have found this to be a pretty good company to work for. many of its employees have longevity with the company. their are great advancement opportunities and incentives.
good,"This company provides security, a great work environment, as well as wonderful benefits-including those for retirement. I would recommend this job to anyone."
good,"enjoyable work space, plenty of work to keep you busy,so time flys by,good people to work with. always learning some thing new. clean friendly store. always greeted when came in for shift."
good,"Very good place to work for. You feel as if you're family. Insurance, 401k and other extras offered. Very good pay compared to other places. No complaints."
good,"Overall good. Not much room for advancement. Part time receive hour cuts in off season. Management bonuses far out weigh lower employee bonuses, and benefit from the hour cuts."
good,I enjoy working for Lowes. I like my co-workers and most of my management team.  I feel there is a new challenge each day and you can always find new ways to adapt to find the right solution.  There is a lot of lifting involved so be prepared for that. Most co-workers are helpful if you are struggling.
good,"I enjoyed the three years I worked at Lima Lowes. The people I worked with were great, the manager would work with you, and the customers left satisfied. The only reason I left was because I needed full time and they were unwilling to give me what I needed even after all I did for the store. I was always the first to be called in if someone called off or did not show up. I worked longer shifts and took shortened lunches whenever we happened to be busy. But, besides all the extra shifts and long hours I love the company and its people!"
good,"As I clock in I report to my Head Cashier so I may be told were to be at as far as register goes, giving breaks, lunches ect. Most of the time I am at the customer service desk were I take back their returns. I am to make sure the product is still a stocked item in the store. I enojoy working with my fellow coworkers we all have our own way of getting along with each other. We all make work fun. We get to know our customers and contractors who come in on a regular. The hardest part of my job I would have to say is the rudeness that comes in the store. We have a policy and procedures we have to follow which i think not all customers understand that and it makes the jib a little hard on employees."
good,"I am enjoying the opportunities I have been given. There is always a project to be working on daily, and great customer service is what we strive for. I enjoy working with all my co-workers, and working together to achieve our common goals. I have learned leadership, and how to handle different types situations."
good,"retos diarios de ventas"
good,I enjoyed my 10 Years with this company. It was a enjoyable place to work. They do care about their employees. Customer service is the mindset going into the job. Hard to balance work/life with the up and down schedule.
good,I've worked for this company for 13 years and I'm extremely thankful for everything they have helped me accomplish. I've grown tremendously as a leader with this company.
good,"My time at lowes was great. Everyone there was all about communication in the work place. It made working there alot easier, even if you were a first time employee. Overall They made working there seem enjoyable.Even if this wasn't something i enjoyed doing."
good,"Work with sales specialist for installs flooring and carpet for customers"
good,"its a great stable place to work. some rules are not right . but , it is what it is. job security. no pay raises . no pay raises, no pay raises"
good,The store manager was a very hardworking man. The job environment was safe. The department managers did not really keep a hold on their departments. Employees would often be lazy or unmotivated. My department manager once told a costumer that was having a hard time lifting a bag of rocks to help her self. I helped the costumer after and told her not to worry I would discount her.
good,"I enjoyed being with Lowes, but the hours can go as low as 20-30 every couple of weeks. I had great management several positive influences to look up to for guidance and instruction."
good,At Lowe's I have learned how to work well with others as well as working well on my own. I have developed great organization skills and have learned how to delegate tasks to other people that I feel can handle that specific task.  The most enjoyable parts of my job are the hours and my co-workers.  The hardest part of my job would be the fact that I am on my feet for eight hours a day walking the entire store on a concrete floor.
good,"The hours slowed depending how busy it was. Some of the managers was ok. Loved the employees most of them where wonderful, But I could see where they could have made improvements. Their has been days where people worked just 1 day out of the week depending how slow it was. Some Managers tried to help you but some where big heads and didn't care less or was total D*CKS. "
good,"I come into work for the day by seeing if a list of job dute's is made for me to fulfill for the day. If there is a list I start on the list and work my way down the list until the list is fulfilled for the day. While working on the list on hand I front and face product on the shelves. While preforming the job dute's I assist customer as I see them needing help with a purchase's, help finding something or need assist with what product will give them the  results they are looking for or better."
good,"Lowe's Foods required good hard work and also being able to think on your feet and come up with ideas on the fly. A typical day for me involved: Going through ALL product in the department to ensure it was fresh, filling product anywhere it was needed, breaking down trucks, data entry, and labor distribution. There was much more than that, but those steps were mandatory day-to-day. I learned how both how to be a team leader and how to follow instructions. Being a manager taught me how to interact with people under and above me in a kind, professional, and positive way. The hardest part of my job was probably ordering truck shipments. If you order too much, your surplus produce will become rotten and if you order too little, you don't have enough product to sell and your sales will decline. Too much of either of these mistakes could result in a termination of your job. The most enjoyable part of my job was the customer service. I love engaging our customers, getting to know them, and showing them the absolute BEST experience one can ever have in a grocery store."
good,Coming into work was a greet with coffee in break room due to FSA (custodial associates). Co-Workers are ready to go to work and ready for work attitudes.
good,"Enjoyed this job very much! I got to answer calls, schedule appointments, file things and keep an organized desk area. Worked with amazing people and had a great time at this job. I would not have left except my husband was getting stationed in Kansas and I was due to have my first baby and dealing with complications."
good,"While employed at Lowe's Home Improvement Center, I was able to learn different aspects of retail sales. I had the opportunity to work serving customers by ringing up sales, processing credit card applications, product warranties, and assistance finding products in the store."
good,"I would arrive at 4 in the morning to prep plants and stock outside lawn and gardening supplies."
good,Great Company  with rom for advancement. Makes sure training is available to improve skills.  Ensures employees are plugged into the company with Pep Rally's.
good,"clock in, go to customer service, check customers out, assist in returns. Cover lunches and breaks, set up work schedules, handling and assisting with online orders. Answering and accommodating all customer related problems and questions. Directing calls throughout the department."
good,"Interact and greet customers daily. communicate with team members to complete everyday goals. If there are any complaints; I solve, I make sure customer is happy when they leave the store. Provide the same amount of appreciation to each customer"
good,"Through excellent customer service, attention to detail, experience and imagination the specialists at Lowe's home improvement make the renovations and projects experience a great one for each customer. We are all knowledgeable one way or another and we try to do everything possible to make people love their home even more everyday."
good,"Being a Human Resource Manager is a job which requires you to keep the whole store on an even keel.  Intervene when there are problems,work with Store Manager and other Managers in the store."
good,Working in Corporate Office was exciting and very easy with a great atmosphere and good working conditions.  Everyone worked well with each other and had good times also.
good,"On the weekends it's pretty busy but for the most part easy on a typical day. "
good,They were Awesome all the time i loved it and the job came with alot of benefits that i enjoyed. They had a savings program and even offered to pay for school if your able to keep a certain average.
good,"I loved Best Buy however I was promised me being a part time worker ,but scheduled 40 hours a week I decided to find a better job opportunity."
good,"Coworkers and managers are supportive and friendly. Great place to learn just not about customer service but also, a lot about the different departments and the products they carry."
good,Meeting customer satisfaction and answering any questions they have. I have learned how to satisfy customers with what they want.
good,Enjoyed working with people. Learned a lot about lawn and garden products and hardware / tools. Fun bunch of people to work with...
good,"Working at the customer service desk was a very fast paced environment which required a lot of multitasking."
good,"Wait on customers, help them find things or check them out. Find different types of accounts and identify them. I learned about the different departments they had. Hardest part I think would be when a customer think you can bring up their account no matter how long ago the item was purchased. The system will only go back so far."
good,"I still don't like to give reviews. One persons view is not the same as another. One person may love a the job they have, while another is totally miserable. All in the prospect of the person."
good,I learned to apply great customer service in a timely matter. I enjoyed learning about he cash register. The events that the store take part in was fun and I enjoyed being part of something.
good,"Great company, good equipment , great employees everybody cares about everyone, i feel like i 'm part of a team.  The most important part of my job is seeking a customer happy. That is very rewarding to me"
good,"Great place to work at. Worked with my school schedule so i was able to work and attend school. Management was very easy to work with, they were open to opinion and ideas to complete work."
good,I enjoyed working at Lowe's for its fast paced enviorment and customer interactions. It was forever changing. Loved working with everyone it was like a family.
good,I didn't work here for too long. The people were nice.  Everyone seemed to get along. There was a young store manager who attended East Carolina when I was there. In Roanoke Rapids..who would think? GO PIRATES
good,I was employeed at lowes for 8 yrs and was sad when i had to leave the other associates were like family and i miss them all. The only thing i didnt like was i felt like i was kept in one position to long and always short handed on help when you needed it.
good,Had Starbucks inside at a discounted price a quite room and the managers were nice and for a call center its the best one you could work at. The customers are ok better than cell phone customers by far till you hit a holiday and their oven don't work then they get mad.
good,"A typical day at work is answering phones, customer service, scheduling service calls, dispatching technicians, filing and invoicing customers."
good,"Extensive training, with an emphasis on safety, both yours and the public. Management very eager to help. HR on premises at all stores. Never a dull day."
good,i was alawys busy work on the sales floor with people had a good team i work with mangement suck most part i like was the people
good,A regular day for me is getting to stay active and move around in the parking lot collecting carts and assisting customers with loading up heavy materials. All my co-workers are very kind and the members of management all appreciate everything I do
good,"Hard workers are hard to find, and some people get promoted that shouldn't. As long as you work hard and do what you're supposed to do then you will go from entry level wage ($8-10) to double that in a few years."
good,"Great place to work, good benefits and good management, just needed to cut some of the hours off of leadership so they could have a family life"
good,"Poor management, not supportive of new ideas and implementations. Not enough people to service the customer base. No advancement opportunity for the employees who go above and beyond for the company."
good,"Most days, the mailroom is laid back and a fun place to work."
good,"This was a great experience and I learned a lot while I was there. It definitely was different for me to learn the in's and out's of retail.

good,Well being my first warehouse job back in 2004 I have a love/hate feeling towards this company. Especially with my uncle being an operations manager at the time
good,"It's definitely simple working at Lowe's I have been there for 3 years. Management is terrible at my store. From what I have heard, it isn't the greatest at most stores. But, they do pay well. It can be very fun for the most part. But be prepared for Department managers to be on you for no reason, because they think they are ASM's. I've been there for 3 years for a reason. It can be horrible, but not horrible enough to quit. Give it a shot and see what you think! I guarantee you  can get away with quite a bit there."

good,"Lowe's is a good place to work but the management do things that aren't very good."
good,"My only problem really was it seemed like since I was such a reliable worker, that they didn't want to give me a raise and move me up because then they wouldn't have this great reliable worker anymore, but a good manager to work during the day. That wasn't what they needed. They needed good employees and I did that to the utmost.

While working at lowes, I have learned what it is like to move up in a company, and I have also been given the skills of being a supervisor and managing a front end. I make sure my cashiers have fun and are comfortable at work, however I also make sure that they do their job in a professional manner and abide by all policies. The hardest part of the job I'll say it dealing with the attitudes of customers but I absolutely love interacting with people and helping people."
good,"It was a great place to work overall. Some of the employees acted like it was a place to make friends, & act like a teenager again, when to me work is just to work, and make money to support yourself and family, but have fun while doing it.

good,Receive product in and process the paper work had a great group of people to work with
good,Those words can be dark and depressing words to hear someone say about a job  but those are things I want in a job. I like constant new challenges that enable to me think outside the box to solve issues.  The job is demanding due to the goals that are set and constant customer attention. Number one goal is Customers. As a Specialist my second goal is Sales. I  must meet requirements for each week of sales.  While still handling product making sure installs are ready to be picked up by the customer or installer.

good,"As the Install Sales Manager, work consisted of high responsibility. The store I worked for was a high volume grade A store. Stayed busy from the moment I clocked in, till the moment I clocked out. Lowes has a good system, although behind with the technology needed to complete day to day tasks; inefficient. Although, I would highly recommend Lowes to anyone interested to work for the company. Management in the store are the best I have ever worked for. Very helpful and clear on the vision of Lowes Values."
good,"We go to the customers house and lay the flooring and I have learned many things from this job from laying the floor and making mud. The management is really good, the boss works with us and shows us the right way to do it if we mess up. My co-workers are really nice guys, they're respectful and work harder than anyone else I know. The hardest part of the job is being on your knees all day, it starts to get painful after a while. The most enjoyable part about my job is laying the flooring and getting to look at it afterwards and getting to say I did that."
good,"Friendly and understandable management. Fast paced, and a lot of walking."
good,"During my working experience at Lowe's  I helped train new employees to become self-efficient and cashier expertise.

I would always start my day by walking my department checking for safety issues, proper merchandising, visual aesthetics of product placement and creating work-list for my staff. As a manager i would review many reports. Including annual and monthly budget reports, scheduling expenditures, analyzing variances, inventory accuracy and initializing corrective actions for overall profitability. Team work was always emphasized strongly which created a bond amongst co-workers. In turn creating a positive, productive, and profitable days work."

good,Old Navy was a GREAT place to work.  I would always help a customer find something that they were looking for.  I was also able to add ADD On sales. ADD On sales are things like if they were looking for a shirt.  We would find their size and suggest that those ROCK STAR JEANS would make that a NICE outfit!!!  Management and co- workers at ON were SUPER!!! Everyone work to please the customer.  The hardest part of the job would be telling a customer that we ran out a particular size or style of something.  The most enjoyable part of working at ON was the employee discount!!!
good,"A typical day for me would be starting my day at 1:45am. My shift starts at 3am, which includes getting up product from the distribution center which could be anywhere from a 600 pc truck to a 1400 pc truck.  I learned how to really manage time well.  Meaning, pushing to have the bulk of the freight up before the first customer comes in at 6am.  Management and my co-workers at Lowe's are VERY supportive in assisting me and my crew with the tools that we need to get the job done.(Helping us work the freight when we have a large truck) I would say the hardest part of my job is there is not enough hours in my shift to make sure that we keep the shelves stock. And the most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the end result of all the hard work my crew and I do.  Knowing that when we walk in there is product every where and at the end of our shift the store is GRAND OPENING READY!!!"
good,Busy and enjoyable work environment.  I enjoyed working with customers and helping them with their purchases.  The management was terrific and always willing to assist as needed.  My co-workers were great and always available to help me when I needed them.  The hardest part of my job was trying to assist a lot of customers at one time during busy periods.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the  interchanges that I had with the customers.
good,"There is no typical day at Lowes Working in the Customer Service Department   handles all types of customers, computer programs, internet orders.

Management is very great to work with. I have great co-workers that are fun to work with. The hardest part of my job is dealing with rude and sometimes mean customers that have unreasonable expectations. The most enjoyable part of my job is the joy of having a customer come back and tell me and show me pictures of their product they have had Lowe's install or have done the install themselves and are proud of what they let me help them make their decision to buy, and they thank me for my help."
good,"Learned a lot about home improvement, management was great, co workers were great and always very helpful, hardest part was trying to remember everyone's name. most enjoyable part was working out in lawn and garden."
good,Easy to separate work and home life and still be happy in both.  Learned how to work more independently and have the opportunity for more advancement.  Management always knows when to be professional and still keep all the customers and employees as happy as possible.

good,"i really enjoy my job at Lowe's.  I work in the cash office where I handle most issues associated with credit card accounts, receipt retrievals, cash overages and shortages.  My job is very detail oriented and communication is essential.  It involves researching and explaining overages and shortages on the daily business, printing and analyzing various reports, and relaying certain issues over to management and loss prevention.  I also have to step outside of my general area and assist with price changes and credit/SOS when these employees are on vacation.  I have to assist at the customer service desk and on the front line registers when the lines get too long.  Management is very understandable and helpful with issues concerning customers as well as employees.  I enjoy meeting customers and helping them when needed.  Most employees are fun to work with and are truely team players.  I learn alot everyday in my general area as well as in other departments such as products that I have never seen before.

My goal is to take care of the customer in a timely and respectful manner."

good,"Ive had a great experience with lowe's over the years, but I have decided its time for a career change."
good,"Not only is this a fun place to work, but if you don't know anything about home improvement, you will definitely learn. You will stay busy all day and you will also get to interact with customers and help them with their project needs. The hardest part is that you don't have the same hours consistently, but you do have a corporate schedule that allows you to at least know your days off indefinitely. Retail is not always easy, but it is a fun atmosphere at Lowes."
good,"Lowes is a great place to work. I like the managers, they are all fair. The work is varied and relatively easy, once you know how things work."

good,A typical day at Lowe's is stocking and maintaining check out area. Greeting customers and assisting when needed. Ringing out customers' merchandise. Being on alert for thieves. I have learned a lot about loss prevention sign to look for when dealing with someone who is trying to steal. I like a lot of my co-workers but most of them are in the gossip circle so I stay clear. The others are very helpful when learning new things. the hardest part of the job is sometimes dealing with a difficult customer and staying professional.

There is always something new to learn at Lowe's. The hardest part of the job is not the work but to see that today's economy has a great effect on whether Lowe's in Garner will remain open.

good,I would prefer not to comment on this. It is something I cant put into context. Cant take a program that took one company 18 months to start and have another one start it in 6 months. Everyone should be held to the same level of accountability
good,The management at Lowe’s was confusing. Each would keep telling you something different. They verbally fought in front of employees. They also would be hard to contact for information and would get give you information on things until days after asking. And would only give vague answers.

good,It was a good job after high school had a good relationship with co workers and managers. The work wasn’t too hard but it took time and kept you busy your entire shift
good,Lowe's was consistent and easily approached with any questions. I learned all aspects in every department which allowed me a thorough knowledge of the store and what it offered.
good,Lowe's was a great place to learn a lot of important values and skills to not only be successful in life but to be able to survive and manage by fixing things when broken in your home.
good,"Working at lowe's was pretty easy, What I did was I stand at a conveyor belt and put labels on boxes with the addition of keeping my station and area clean at all times. You get benefits and get paid a little above minimum wage."
good,I enjoyed working at Lowes. I met so many great people. I've learned new skills as well working there. The atmosphere is wonderful. Mostly everyone is friendly and helpful. Management is terrible. The entire front end management should be replaced other than that it's an amazing job.

good,"Constant, and often strenuous transactions, make Lowe's a busy but informative experience. As a starting employee, there is no end to the knowledge that can be gained from this environment."
good,"Assembler work is enjoyable if you can tolerate repetitive tasks, and is also very calm and low pressure (except on the most busy days). The management was good. The hardest part of the job was locating items and waiting for assistance in retrieving them, which requires coordinating with coworkers who are trained in using the equipment (and who have work to do themselves)."

The concrete floors of these big box stores can be very hard on feet and legs people with medical issues may find it hard to stand on it full time. Chairs are only at some work stations.

good,"Family atmosphere where associates work as a team.  Management is involved in all areas and taking care of customers is top priority.  Daily work schedule is posted 2 weeks in advance to allow time to schedule family time, dr appointments, etc"
good,"I was responsible for making sure there was product available for the store such as grills, lawn furniture and lawn tractors. Each day I had a report of what needed to be built and when it was going out on delivery. My job was to make sure items were built and ready for delivery. The hardest part of the job was to get the product I needed since sometimes it was in the store and I would have to get help from staff. I enjoyed the assembling part. All my managers were friendly and I feel I got along with the nicely."
good,"I have 2 interview with the managers ,ask me for my experience we talking about my others jobs and why I can do the difference working with them and explain how I do  the difference in the store."
good,9 hours with an hour lunch 5 days a week. You might close at 12:00am on Sunday night and then might be opening at 6:00am Wednesday thru Friday. Fast pace all day and there are no chairs to sit on in Lowes except the break room which you may only get to see for a few minutes a day. The pay is fair ( no pressure or politics at the associate level) and the managers work as hard as everyone else.
good,"Lowes like any other fortune 500 company, has daily business desicions to consider. When change is inevitable, they take into consideration the impact on their employees and families. Lowes is a great company to work for and advancement potential is always there. Strong long lasting employment."
good,I enjoyed assisting customers and fixing any problem they encountered with their order.  I learned to work with many different types of people and enjoyed the experience.

good,"productive and good place to work for. chances to advance, nice people to deal with and always willing to finish the job on time working always as a team"
good,"Once a year we are asked to fill out an employee survey. The last question on my survey read “how would you describe Lowes”. The only word/feeling that kept coming to me was “family “. Everyone is amazing. If your  ready to show up and treat this place like it’s yours...  your house,your yard, your family. I love working here."
good,A typical day at work is fast pace and answering the phones a lot and checking people out. I have learned how to multitask like answering phones taking notes and checking people out at the same time. The management was good at being there to help when needed. The work culture is not fighting and everyone gets along and helps out with everything that you need help with. The hardest part of the job was having to help someone that was upset with something that went wrong. The most enjoyable was meeting new people all the time making friends and learning so much everyday.
good,"Working at Lowe's is enjoyable and challenging.  The work expectations and time allotted to be able to complete can be frustrating at time.  More work than time allows to complete.  Encouraging environment with great leadership.   Interacting with regular customers, employee's and management is very enjoyable.  Finding solutions to each of their needs drives me to do better each day."
good,"A typical day at work consists of many customers asking for help with loading purchases or information about certain items and their whereabouts. I’ve learned to drive the forklift thanks to my supervisors who have helped me become better at what I do. There’s no difficult part of the job because I enjoy working with customers and learning something new everyday."
good,"I liked the 10 hour shift, but the hours were @ an odd time 6:30 pm till 4:30am. They have a lunch room with pretty good food. Most of their employees are hired straight out of high school, so are not very reliable & trying to screw everything they can lol..."
good,Managers give me the freedom and flexibility I need as the head of the customer service department to handle the needs of the customers that call and contact us in store.
good,Lowe's is going down hill so fast. There is absoultely no structure or disipline in the atmosphere. When a manager sees a worker busting their tail they abuse the one worker and the others just stand around. Did i mention how poor the management was???? POOOR!!!!!
good,"good place for work, safety first,good shift.nice people, good pay , give me training for operate equipment , good insurance , my boos the best of the best"
good,Other than schedule I liked it and wish I didn’t have an ongoing injury they pay was great and loved the management they would help with mostly anything

good,"I hated I had to leave due to the cost of living rose in this area, and as a single mom had to look for a higher paying job w more hours.  Would definitely love to go back if presented an opportunity to do so in the future."
good,I worked here for almost a year just as a part time job and I really enjoyed it. My managers were great and easy to talk to and the coworkers all got along.
good,I don't have anything negative to say about working for this company apart from the drama of gossip and hearsay that you'll have at any and every job that has more than one employee. You were expected to work some weekends but they did rotate so you were guaranteed at least one full weekend of a month as well as one of the two days if the weekend off another weekend if the month. They train new employees for their departments and it's definitely a company that offers the opportunity to grow and move up the ladder.
good,"I was only employed part time, so there wasn't any benefits for Part time Employees."
good,"Good for students, but may not be the best for long term employment without advancement. Manager jobs pay good but take specific skills not possessed by many."
good,"The culture, the coworkers, the vibe! Fast paced always on your toes but you’re never bored. Plenty of training hours before you actually complete and start working on the floor. Advancement to grow and move to different departments."
good,Lowe's is a professional yet fun place to work.A job you can definitely make a career.I would work for this company again and there's always an opportunity to advance.
good,was a great place to work except had problems with my manager felt took advantage of his power it's a great place due to the hour lunches and fifteen minute breaks
good,Lowes is a very diverse work environment. I enjoyed meeting and greeting the customers. The hardest part of the job may be when the store advertisements show we had a certain item in stock by not available to customers when they arrive at store location.
good,"learned to work on conveyor belts, replacing belts and rollers and various corrective and preventative maintenance on fork lifts and yard trucks, varied each day."
good,"Very busy"
good,"Job at Lowe's Garden is seasonal. Loved working with the all the people at Lowe's Garden. It was a fun, relaxing job with different things to learn and do daily. My employer was always kind and understanding with my physical restrictions due to my health. I looked forward to going to work and liked the work I did."
good,I was in the paint department and worked my way into assistant department manager by cleaning up and organizing the paint department and adjusting to new planograms within a few days.
good,"Lowe’s offers advancement opportunities as well as a great environment  for retirees to work part-time. It just depends what you are looking for. If you are looking for advancement to management, there are a lot of opportunities to advance within. If you are looking for flexible part-time, there are a lot of positions as well. There are even seasonal jobs available where you can return from year to year."
good,"You often hear Lowe's is a great place to work & retire.  "
good,"Treat the customers like you would want to be treated and you will succeed in that business, have a positive attitudelearn as much as you can and every department and find out about the benefits in the stock and would it take to invest and"
good,"very fun environment for helping customers, breaks every 4 hours, the management was great and the most enjoyable part of the job was getting off after working a full shift"
good,"Lowe's is a wonderful employer where I learned a plethora of skills in gardening, plumbing, electrical, flooring, tools, outdoor power equipment, and large household appliance repair and installation."
good,Day started at 8 am with a list of items needed to be picked throughout the store. 12-15 items on average. I would then load the truck and leave by 10 am. I would make deliveries and installments until around 6 pm.
good,"Gives younger workers a good introduction to picking up skills and staying busy on the job. Teaches the basics of retail, and the company makes communication with management very easy. Positive working environment, only challenge can be when customers have more complicated home improvement related questions. Very fun team to be a part of."
good,Fast paced environment and offers different challenges each day.  Dealing with customers is both the best and most difficult part of the job.  A new CEO has brought fresh energy and a drive to beat our biggest competitor.
good,"The company has great benefits, an awesome culture and amazing hours and pay. One bad apple ruins the entire barrel though. One ASM Richard Valadez targets certain employees and makes life a living nightmare for them until they want to leave. If you want to work for this company, great. Just watch that you stay under his radar."
good,"Lowe's is a great company to work for, but as with any retail business they have a lack of experienced leadership in their management teams."
good,"Overall it’s a wonderful place to work, along woth the benefits and neighboring associates. The only downside is management, and not being given a good outlook on what’s expected of you as an employee."
good,a typical workday consists of helping people love where they live. You spend each day helping people find products they need for there upcoming projects.
good,"As an unloader at 4 AM we worked our tails off for about 3-4 hrs."
good,I loved working for this company. The only reason I left was there were no open full time positions and I needed the full time hours. If I callus have gotten a position with the hours I believe I would have never left.
good,Working at Lowe's is a great experience and fun when you get along with your coworkers. Can be difficult depending on what area you work in. The management was easy to work with when needing time off.
good,"This is a nice place to work.   Scheduling needs work, but compensation and benefits make up for it.    Lots of opportunities to learn or even be creative."
good,Lowe's is a great place to work. I worked for the Contact Center and can honestly say I have never loved a job as much as I loved it there! I plan to return when I can. They are so accommodating and will work with you as long as you stay open and communicative.
good,"Set up for success, great work atmosphere, knowledgeable  management. Hardest part of the job was the difficult customer complaint calls, most enjoyable part of the job was the amount of support given from supervisor and co-workers."
good,Management really stick up for good workers. Flexible shifts when needed and always listened to both sides of both parties if an incident ever occurred I'm the work environment
good,Lowe's in the Nashville area pays more than minimum wage to start.  Flexible hours for those with children and continuing education. West Nashville Lowe's was the best I worked at.  Hendersonville Lowe's was the worst.  Very poor management.
good,"This lower worked well overall, everyone had a great comradery that helped us to utilize other people when dealing with customers or asking for help. Everyone was going above and beyond what they needed to do."
good,I have been blessed to work a long time for Lowe's. The benefits are outstanding. The groundwork has been laid for me to retire very well some day. The company is going through radical changes to become #1 in the category of home improvement retailer.
good,I love Lowe's. I love all the opportunities that Lowe's has to offer. I personally just have to move on because the direction of the company has eliminated my position in house.
good,Would definitely work their again in the future. I worked in customer service first then moved to the front line l. Then asked to move to the lumber area.
good,"I loved working at Lowe's  , my fellow employees were so nice and helpful when I first started and were very patience with me and I am sad that it was only a temporary position. I have learnt a lot while I was working at Lowe's and the management are awesome. The most enjoyable part about working at Lowe's is that everyone is so nice and friendly and helpful when I wasn't sure where something was."
good,Lowes has many great opportunities for all ages of learning on how to repair your home or just create a project.  A typical shift would be clocking in and immediately greeting a customer to find out what needs were and if I could be of any assistance. Management allowed you to put your creativity to work. The hardest part was if we ran out of product and that product was  discontinued Lowes was not able to get the product back in stock. Most enjoyable interacting with customers.
good,honestly i miss working at Lowes i loved the job but my personal life required that i moved so i had to quit unfortunately i tried going back cause the managers said they would rehire me but for some reason they never did
good,Overall some of the managers were super nice and always tried to help and other were really busy and couldn’t. But everyone there was super nice and made work s better place to go to.
good,I unloaded trucks as a receiver and separated what needed to be separated onto pallets and lined them up into their lanes for the runners to pick them up. In shipping I was loading trucks with pallets non con and conveyable products. I would help the door guys build my walls so I can continue to load more pallets and product.
good,Lowes is fun at time and stressful at time. But it a good place to work if u want work retail all your life .Lowes pays pretty good to be retail . u get good benefits
good,"I had a good experience as a seasonal loader and would return if another position was available."
good,"Midland, MI Lowe's offers flexible scheduling and has kind Management. The environment is very warm and welcoming. They will often have rewards, prizes or free meals for their employees. They make me feel like a valued member of their team."
good,"Merchandising Service Associate is the best job at Lowe's . You work a set schedule (Monday-Friday) and work early morning hours typically starting at 6am.  You don't have to engage with customers in this position, you only have to help answer their questions if they ask you to help them.  You will stay busy in this position because there is always something to do."
good,"I loved the position of PSI. I also worked in a great store with wonderful coworkers and management. It seemed very stable during my time there. My position was eliminated in May with no real explanation. My sales were number 3 in our area at time. About to become number 1. I was fairly given 1 month notice, opportunity to apply for other company positions, and a severance package. I have now discovered the entire program has been eliminated. Very disappointing. We were told how much value we added at every training meeting. The average PSI sale was like selling 5000 gallons of paint. Ultimately, our area had a great group of professionals who worked hard and had great numbers. I was in Verizon of my career so I was not financially devastated. But, younger folks have mortgages, children, etc. and this will hurt. I ultimately think it is a mistake. The only thing that differs brick and mortar from mail order is customer service. We offered a valuable service to the community. The program needed tweaks, but had the potential to place Lowe's above other home improvement businesses."
good,"Really liked working there. The environment was idea for me since it was my second job, and management treated me pretty fairly, I would work here again."
good,Working at Lowes is a great experience where you can pick up some pretty good real life skills. Lowes just started offering free school for full time employees. great place to work and very laid back as long as you do your work while keeping customers happy.
good,"Lowe's is a great place to work.  All of my associates were very supportive, and always willing to help with my customers and projects. The store manager was also very supportive and encouraging."
good,"People are friendly, work well as a team, always willing to assist customers, vendors, and co-workers.  We continue to change and grow.  Management truly cares about both your work /home life as well."
good,Overall Great Place to work. Advancement good based on Productivity. Flexible hours. Customer service a great part of job. Customer is the most important aspect and making a personal relationship is key to success.
good,Lowes is a great temporary place to work..my manager is great. The coworkers are great but there is not much room for advancement unless you would like to be a manager
good,"Nice place to work, always enjoyed coming in. Management eventually went downhill, but I still loved going in. Everyone becomes a part of a huge, cooperative family."
good,For the most part the company is great.  In recent years they have been getting hit hard and stores have been needing to close along with a lot of restructuring.
good,Lowes is a well rounded place to work with its ups and down. Mostly ups in this case. The benefits for full time associates are expensive and management is not great about family/work life.
good,Fast paced work environment always on the go.  I enjoy my job with Lowe’s sometimes the weather does not cooperate with us because we are in and out of the vehicle and in and out of businesses and houses but for the most part everything is grand
good,"A large number of fellow workers that always try to provide you with help to do your job and support you.  A group of fun loving associates that have your back, including the managers."
good,"Very motivated company, learned to be patient with customers, listen, be courteous, worked as a team tackling everyday tasks. Always kept busy in both paint and home decor. Hardest part of the job is sometimes you take work home in your head, but what i enjoyed most was the camaraderie we had in our depts."
good,Lowe's has a great culture to work in. I owe all my leadership qualities to Lowe's and the many that I have been mentored by. They truly put the customer as the focus.
good,"Working at Lowe's I really felt apart of not just a team but a family. At the warehouse we are committed to safety, helping each other out, working together as a team to fix the problems and taking pride in our work."
good,Lowe’s was very flexible worked around school and worked with you for daycare. Lowe’s was fast paced but fun to work at. I did a lot of training and customer service.
good,"I worked seasonally over summer and very much enjoyed my time at Lowe's working between 20-40 hours a week having the most in the beginning and waining off at the end of my employment. Management was accommodating with schedule conflicts and helpful in situations when needed. Worked in the seasonal section and spent most time stocking and helping customers when needed. Pretty laid back job as long as you do your daily task and assist customers. When I started all the employees were very nice and welcoming which made for an even better work experience. The hardest part about Lowe's was when it got busy there may be only 1 person in the department and having to allocate your time was difficult but manageable in the end. Getting fired can be pretty easy if you use machinery incorrectly, are unsafe or didn't actually work otherwise it's pretty laid back."
good,"I worked nights because I was a stay at home mom during the day. It was wonderful to get out and make friends.  We were one of the busiest stores in our district, but we knew how to still have fun and put our customers needs first."
good,Lowe’s has many positions within the company for both newcomers to the workforce as well as existing workers. Competitive pay with routine training make for great growth opportunities within the company. Good benefits with many options. Overall a faced-paced friendly environment to work in with opportunities to learn about home improvement and employee discount.
good,They were very welcoming.  Management supported decisions and listened to positive construction.  Workplace culture was great as we all worked together to get tasks completed.
good,"Come in the mornings and load the truck according to the route that was determined by the coordinator that morning starting with the last stop and finishing with the first stop. Hardest part of the job is it is physically demanding, moving 450+lb refrigerators up and down stairs.  The group of people that I worked with were all friendly and a lot of fun to work with. I love how the job required problem solving skills at each stop since not to many house are the same.  Some days management left a lot to desire but for the most part the delivery crews were left alone to self manage and get the job done."
good,"I started part time stocking garden supplies. After 4 months I was moved to Freight Unload Team and moved to team lead after a few months, where I had my own 4 man team to unload and stock product."
good,"I enjoyed my time working with this company. The benefits were well explained and decent. As to management, the managers cared about our mental and physical health. They liked to work around our schedules when possible."
good,Lowe’s is a great customer based company. The most enjoyable part of my day is helping the customers at the customers service desk it is a constant pace with answering customers questions and calls
good,It’s a good place to work they give you free lunch if you reach your performance once a month it’s not a bad place to work for it’s a good place to work if your single with no bills.
good,The company helps you move forward as an employee. Everyone is trying to provide good customer service. The people who work there are people you would be glad to see outside work.
good,"There is safety check that your need to do in the morning,   and merchandise checks and Recording that merchandise. Inventory replacement and helping customers. Cutting Glass, Rekeying Locks, Mixing Paint and running Cash register. Manager Jump right in and help, when needed. Everyone helps each other. The hardest part of my job, is when my Grandchildren are at my house, to leave and go to work. And the most enjoyable part is my Coworkers and Customers."
good,"I personally love my job at Lowe's. I am a part time cashier. The workplace culture is relaxed, everyone here is like a big family. Most everyone gets along with everyone and you'll feel welcome upon your first day. During the summer months, it can get hectic and a little busy/stressful since we have a garden center and are a home improvement store. Winter months are not always enjoyable and can be pretty slow moving. Most of my shifts are scheduled 9 hours, with a 15 minute paid break, one hour lunch, and another 15 minute paid break if time permits (which is almost always)."
good,"Every day at work is pretty upbeat and productive. The staff was willing to assist new workers when unsure about certain products. Overall, there was always work to be done and people to help you through the workday!"
good,The best part of the job was getting to know the other associates & how close I became to some of them. The hardest part of the job was some unfriendly customers & managers
good,"Great company to work at. Good managers. You don't have to worry if you care about, customer needs and  the company commitment to good service........"
good,This was a good learning experience in all areas I love to learn new things and advance and this easna good customer relationship job tonhelpntou focus on helping others.
good,"Meeting the customers and helping them in completing their projects. working with the local community in events such as safety Saturday in which the fire department, police, Bikers against child abuse (BACA), team up together with a car show and food vendors in the Lowes parking lot to take advantage and spread the word on what they all can offer to the local community."
good,Great management and coworkers. Lots of employee appreciation pizza parties and cookouts. I had a lot of fun working there and wish I didn't have to leave.
good,Most of the full time permanent employees were happy with their wages and working conditions. I took a permanent full time position with another employer.
good,"From the time i clock in to the time I walk out. You may experience some fun customers to interact with. In the lumber department you may have to aid a customer, stock, or even clean. There was plenty of things to do to make you productive. Management was great and flexible with your hours. If you needed help they would gladly help you or find some to assist you. The culture around you is great and i enjoyed most if not all of the people I worked with or even helped on a day to day basis. The hardest part about the job was no doubt the physical aspects of the store. A lot of lifting is involved with working at Lowes. No doubt the most enjoyable aspect of working at Lowes was the interaction with customers. You meet alot of customers on a day to day basis and you also get alot of returning customers."
good,"I enjoyed my time working this as a part time college student, but not where I can use and focus my career. They worked on my schedule and were really friendly."
good,Lowe's store 1678 needs to get rid of the store manager and hr manager the store manager wouldn't know a good employee from mud and the hr manager is to busy trying to get in every males pants
good,"Great job, wonderful fellow employees and management, but I was looking for something that fit my schedule and 3-12 every day was not what I needed. :)"
good,Empresa muy buena exelentes compañeros exelente ambiente muy buenos jefes
good,"I love the company, overall its a great company I like the work environment. The only negative factor I would say about the company is hours were cut and each cashier is ""supposed"" to be guaranteed 20 hours a week and I have been given 16-17 hours while other cashier have been getting 22-24."
good,I absolutely loved for Lowes! I spent two years working for store 0403 in Savannah. The work in environment takes some getting used to but once you do YOU WILL LOVE IT!
good,"I was going to school at the time and they were very flexible with my school schedule. The atmosphere is very laid back, as long as you do your job everything is ok."
good,Always keep busy even if there is nothing else to do. Constantly ask customers for help and maintain good customer service. Managers are okay with helping you only when they're not busy. Hours are extremely flexible for those who are in school or have another job.
good,Great place to work. I worked there for 2 years and enjoyed working there. I worked on the PSA team and then transitioned to the overnight team. It was a great experience
good,Family environment. I really enjoyed the opportunity I had and think that Lowe's is a great place for Industrial Engineers. Appears to be many advancement opportunities.
good,Lowe’s was good all around to me. I did not stay there to love but over the little time I was there I really did enjoy it. management was great and very understanding.
good,Great atmosphere. Except you may get stuck in garden for long hours. All pros and cons of customer service. Many breaks and descent times too. Overall great experience
good,EVERYONE was friendly and worked as a team player..i would return on the next hiring event!The manager was great with helping out in situations where they was needed.
good,Lowe's overall seems to really look out for their employees and that typically includes the management team. Usually comfortable asking for assistance with new tasks/expectations of customers because there is a ton to learn across the different departments. Pretty helpful coworkers and the ability to meet new people through them and customers.
good,Overall good place to work with great managers and a team attitude. However I'm not making enough to afford my cost of living so I will unfortunately be having to find a better paying job.
good,"Good company, caring, easy to communicate with. Work hard and they are there to help you. I feel they always have my back. Lowe's got me through a difficult time in my life."
good,It was a very fast-paced job and gave me a lot of good starting experience. I was very excited to expand my customer service attributes. There always seems something to do so you would never get bored.
good,the people are good and management treats you right. the salary could be better but the environment makes up for the wage. there are lots of opportunity to move forward
good,I work there for 5 yrs and I love like my coworkers and my supervisor but my store manager did not care about her workers at all. The place is a fast pace working store
good,Lowes was a great place to work at and I could see myself returning one day. I did enjoy working there often but at times it could get very boring but a nice place.
good,You definitely keep busy. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people all of the time.Being a head cashier is fun and challenging. you get a great workout with all of the walking around!
good,The most enjoyable part are you co-workers. Y’all become family and it’s great. You learn a lot and get to help in any department when needed. Overall it is a great place to work.
good,Lowes has been very good to me. It can sometimes get challenging when customers don't get their way but I've learned to just deal with it. Rules are rules.
good,"Great place to work part time. Being retired from a previous employment, Lowe's has flexible hours and great managers to work for. Customers also have been great to meet."
good,"One of the best places ive worked so far, worked overnight stock and they had a great team and great pay. Was hired for season during the summer and was offered a full time position but was unable at the time to take it. Would most definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a job."
good,Like my job and work schedule. Clean work area  .friendly coworkers .  Work tools provided and supplies .part supplier quickly sent parts in a timely fashion.
good,"Fast past when spring and summer season, Great place to work at least if its a first job.  Chance to grow and get promoted.   Some times the managers are not all in one mind set and that will drive your crazy. But if you are a positive person that does not let that bother you, you will be fine!"
good,"While it is unfortunate to leave Lowes in such a short time, I would reply if a position was available. I was a Seasonal worker so as expected I knew that my position wasn't permanent. Lowes had great people and the managers were pretty cool too. Best place I've worked so far."
good,"fast paced, decent pay, challenging and rewarding, friendly employees, management is great, good 401k match, very good dental and vision coverage, enjoyable"
good,"Good people for the most part. Most of the management try their best. "
good,"The environment is fast paced, customer focused. Not so much employee focused. Many systems in place to monitor job performance and increase morale. Helpful management staff, while being somewhat demanding. However, it is a warehouse style position so it is not the cleanest."
good,I loved working at Lowe's. The managers were approachable when there were issues and my co-workers were excellent. Good training program and there is room to advance if you want to.
good,"Easy job. Follow policies and be on time and you will stay a long time.  Starting pay is based on your schooling and experience, so everyone gets paid fairly."
good,"It was hard at the beginning but once I got the hang of it, it became easier. I made quick friends with the 5 person stock team. They taught me all they knew and I became even better at my job. I over came my fear of walking up ladders with heavy objects in my hands."
good,I really enjoyed working for this company.  The job is fast paced and fun and does come with its share of challenges.  There is always opportunity to move up in the company.  The only con I have is that sometimes management has gaps in communication when issuing instructions.
good,Store 12 in Lafayette IN  is great to work at!  We  all work together for the  greater good.   Transfering to store 653 was a whole different  matter.    What is corporate policy and what is store policy are two totally different  things
good,"You can come clock in and have a nice chat with your coworkers on your way to the floor. Often times you will be asked and tasked with helping your other workers in addition to your own work, as you are a community."
good,A nice place to work has its perks and downfalls. A lot has changed since I first started working here and one of them has been the loss of unity amongst employees.
good,Hard to tell what Lowes is really like. I've been working in a very small version of Lowe's in Manhattan. The work is minimal but they do pay well compared to HD.
good,"Enjoyed the work environment,  got along great with people relaxeing pace of work, had very great training. They seem to really care about there employees"
good,"Loved my time there, sad that I had to leave in order to focus on my college career more. The managers were always eager to help out and help you grow as a worker."
good,"You learn a lot working here from how things work to what they're called to how things are used. I learned a lot here and made good friends here in each department. Probably the nicest place to work at because the customers here are understanding, kind and patient. Take care of the customer and the customer will take care of you."
good,Meeting the deadlines when you are under staffed was the hardest part of the job. If everybody work together and efficiently then you will finish.....
good,Enjoyed working there. Fun place to work if you enjoy retail. Pay decent for retail. Opportunities to change departments. Overall would recommend working here.
good,"Everyone there was a great person to work with and the managers were super nice, especially in lawn and garden. Absolutely would work there again in that department"
good,"It can have its good and bad days , busy weekends. learned how to build a relationships with customers. did alot of heavy lifting though but over all good"
good,"This was my first job when I moved to Arizona, great family oriented environment and I feel the employees are great. Very good company to have worked for."
good,"I really enjoyed my time,environment and employees at lowes.There were so many great memories and moments while I was working at Lowes.I loved the fact that each department had team based meetings to discuss ideas or issues to improve the department."
good,I enjoyed Lowe's. I enjoyed the great customer service I provided to customers I would feel a great since of accomplishment when helping them find what they were looking for.
good,"Lowe's was a lot to keep up with, but if you stayed determined and spent time working, you were rewarded with a really nice bonuses every month. I loved it there."
good,Love the manager there. Got respected for the work you did. Took care of customers and built many displays for the store. Drove all the forklifts which was fun. I opened up the store so we were all excited to work there. Worked in the millwork dept. which was great being a carpenter then moved around  to different departments that had to do with construction. All good
good,A great place to work.  Hard to get full time hours though.  Nice if you wanted just a part time employment. Very experienced staff in all areas.  Willing to help you in anyway possible.   A good bunch of workers.  I enjoyed getting to know them all!!  I would recommend this place of employment  to anyone.
good,You get the occasional incompetent manager and rude customer but it inst really that bad. Pay is good and vacation time is great. Hours on average are inconsistent as you could be working 5-2 one day then 3-12 the next .
good,"A typical day at work would be help assist customers whenever they need help. As an employee you make sure customer's experience at the store is easy, helpful, and great. The Lowe's store i work at, is one big family. We help each other through a long, hard working day. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help customers make home improvement decisions, also my teammates and lastly the pets customers bring in. The hardest part of my job sometimes is being short staff. Also not being able to provide what the customer wants and or needs because the store doesn't have it, which makes customers upset."
good,As a store associate my day was spent stocking and facing he shelves. I worked a few departments and learned a lot. As a forklift driver I was able to help in all departments.
good,Very nice work environment. If you're there to work hard. With different staffing agencies as a part of Lowes feel divided at times. Over all it's a good place to make a career.
good,"The only company I have worked at where drama is not tolerated, Management is professional and the employees are treated well. Everyone works for their quota and makes the time go by fast."
good,Team culture with room for advancement through training & job performance. A clear family mentality within the ranks. Lots of barbecues and such storewide as a reward for store sales and good Division reviews. I started as a cashier for 6.00$ an hour and ended as a Installed Sales Manager at 16.03$ an hour.  Definite room for advancement if you apply yourself.
good,Amazing job with lots of opportunities for advancement. Great benefits and excellent pay. You can learn a lot about home improvement. They cross-train you in other departments so you can get a better of knowledge of how things work. Would definitely recommend anyone to work there.
good,"I enjoyed customer interaction in the sales of products and services that Lowe's offers. I also enjoyed the success related to my experience working with Lowe's sales tools. If one takes the time to learn them, they work very well."
good,"I liked working there because it was a social job. I really liked having a conversation with each customer that I cashed out. I learned to be patient with customers and to be quick on my feet. The hardest part of the job was when we got super busy for 3 hours straight non-stop. that got pretty tiring. The most enjoyable part about the job was talking with the customers. I just did not like how we were short cashiers, so it was tough when the store was packed."
good,it was nice working for this company. i got to move around daily. i was hardly in the same place twice. i got to learn all the different departments and got to socailize with guests and helping them complete their home projects.
good,There's something to be said about awesome management when people have been at a retail job for 4+ years. Such a loving community and made work fun. The people I worked with made the job awesome.
good,"Management is pretty good, Good Knowledge of what hey do."
good,I enjoyed working for Lowe's.  It was a fun and positive work environment and the manager's were supportive and invested in their employee's.  The hardest part of the job was the pay rate was low and the enjoyable part of the job was the team work in helping my fellow co-worker's and the customers.
good,It is a very fun workplace. It is always something new and different. I am never bored at work. The people they hire are great. It is almost like we are a family
good,Great place to work if you are looking for part time opportunities. Very customer and safety oriented. Above average pay for the area. I would work for them again.
good,Fun friendly environment to work in. They have stock options great benefits and decent pay. The management was great at the location I worked at. If you work hard you can definitely advance.
good,"I enjoyed working with all of my coworkers and the customers."
good,"I enjoy working there because every day is a different one with different customer needs looking to make their home a better place."
good,I have no complaints. It is a great work place and management treats you with respect. Working here can get you extra money when bonuses hit. Working for Lowe’s you also learn lots.
good,This was an ok place to work. I do enjoy enteracting with customers and helping people. I find pleasure in walking around and helping customers find what they need.
good,Lowe’s is great until they “change” your job duties and throw extra work on you for the same pay. Competitive pay none the less but def lots of WORK  people get fired over attendance mostly. Not enough training!
good,"Lowes is one of the best companies I have worked for. Their benefits are amazing, and the atmosphere is never dull. I quickly became management, through showing dedication and knowledge. One draw back of Lowe's is you literally have to be totally open with your schedule. They do not allow you to select hours, and for a single parent  - They were less than helpful with understanding my situation at times. "
good,"Lowe's is a good place to work with a lot of growth opportunities.  Advanced systems at corporate offices, RDC's, and plants.  Very competitive atmosphere  but for those who achieve there are lots of opportunities for advancement.   Pay is good with better than average benefits"
good,"Management is good. Training is good.  Company allows you to be self-motivated.  Ability to learn a lot and move throughout the different departments and work with a wide range of people.  Hours are very long though, and difficult to balance work/family life."
good,"I helped customers all day with checking them out to helping with returns."
good,"Working at Lowe's was a great opportunity to learn and expand. With so many departments there is a  plethora of choices to find where you are gifted. I felt at home in the Pro department , that allowed me to learn the entire store vs one single department."
good,loved working for lowes was a great experience loved the workers but management was a major issue in the company that put a major strain on workers and was creating bad work environment for us employees.
good,"Great management, helpful and understanding. They are there when I need them and are able to answer any question that I may have. Coworkers are also very accommodating."
good,"Lowe's was a good place to work. As a cashier, I had the opportunity to interact with customers and assist with their needs. I also enjoyed the opportunity we had to cross-train in other areas within the store. It was a little uncomfortable asking customers if they wanted to purchase a warrantee or some other offering the store had, but that became easier with time. You really need comfortable shoes because you mostly stand while at work, and the floor is hard on your feet."
good,I thought it was a place that let you be yourself. I had started as a cashier but was trained in all departments and feel like I could walk into a Lowe's today and easily start working there again. Would definitely start working there again if the opportunity presented itself
good,"Lowe's is one of the leading companies on home improvement, great products and professional advise and services to the public. Kitchens, patios, appliances for everyone's needs"
good,the manegement team at lowes was great always could go to them with a question. very helpful when wanting to take some time off if its available. i worked in delivery and the manager there was great. would go back to work for him if the option presented itself. also great group of guys to work with
good,"Lowe's is what I call a tough but rewarding job. Management is caring and understanding. I learned much from everyone there, and still have many friends who work there."
good,I learned a lot in my years at Lowe’s. They taught me how to manage difficult situations and really molded me into the person I am today. I really enjoyed my time there and would do it all again.
good,"Good place to work benefits and management are a plus. Recently just got better because they are hiring more people."
good,Pretty good job but don't expect to advance much unless you're going to stay for several years. Work life balance isn't bad but the pay is lower than a lot of other places around town and not everybody makes the same amount based on experience. Favorites seem to get paid pretty well so go make friends with HR asap.
good,I was part of the loading and unloading crew at Lowes. My day would start with clocking in and looking over the paper work from the teams Manager. then I would help the crew setup to receive a shipment. I would then proceed to unload the product and sort to there designated locations to taken out to the product floor.
good,"good job, good benefits, team work involved, customer service stressed highly, monthly meetings with food provided, lunch breaks and regular breaks were good"
good,"I was in corp sales and loved it ! I was in sales for over year and did about 20,000 dollars a day I did not like 2nd shift but loved the job I was asked to go to surveys and that's where it went south . It had a little better hours but the job made me feel like a robot could not show any emotion at all. I kept asking to be taken back to sales but there was no openings"
good,Once assigned duties you worked at your own pace. Management did not bother you as long as you were getting your job done. Management was very conscientious about breaks and lunches.
good,"Lowes is very well mannered from the top on down. The company has a major focus on customer service. Training of management and all associates is of very high quality. "
good,"pay was low, but for a part-time job as a cashier it was a great place to work. loved the people and the atmosphere. one of the best places I have ever worked. management was very organized and everyone was very helpful."
good,"You have good days and bad days."
good,"The work is easy and the management are great. The pay is not the best, but if you work hard advancement is not out of reach. Like any job your attitude determines your success."
good,"While my position was eliminated from the company, my time with Lowes was career altering. I never expected to serve on the forefront of retail, It was Lowes that changed that. I respect the company, and miss my prior position.,"
good,"Stocking, sorting, inventory control, customer service, computer graphic designing, problem solving, customer interaction, sales and installation contracts."
good,"excellent company to work for . Management is shady!!!!!"
good,"helping customers, off loading items on truck, making sure that items get to shelves in a timely manner, doing and filling out paperwork, and operating forklift. While working at Lowes i learned to work well with customers, learned how operate a forklift in the proper way, and entery level management skills. Management was great, awesome leadership skills, kept everyone working on one accord, warehouse stayed organized at all times, Workplace culture was great, everyone got along, Teamwork was the goal at end of every work day, and store goals always got meat I had no hard parts while working at Lowes, everything came easily to me. I most enjoyed the feeling of Family. Teamwork was overall goal at the end of the day and as a family we always achieved it at Lowes."
good,"High-paced, worked all departments.  Designed with clients went to client homes to measure."
good,"I worked in OSLG (Outside Lawn and Garden). Which basically means in the thundering rain, beaming hot sun, or the tiny little snow flurries of Alabama you were OUTSIDE. For the most part it didn't bother me because managers did not want to have to come outside so my work area was very relaxed, until my pregnancy was deemed high risk and I had to resign."
good,"Great company to work for, and very knowledgeable people working with me.Most people have good work ethics.i enjoyed working there, but ready to learn and try new things."
good,I really enjoyed working there and the environment was really welcoming and great. I enjoyed my job and loved what I did! It was a great feeling helping people.
good,If you work hard you can go as far as you want to. The benefits are amazing. The company really does care about their employees and shows that with celebrations throughout the year. It can be very stressful with the restructuring of management. Less people more responsibility.

good,"Well managed team, GM was absolutely amazing. great co-workers, highly motivated training staff. good physical labor, opportunity for hard work to be noticed"
good,"I enjoyed the work, however, you do get the occasional rude customer but that is with all call center positions and working with the public in general. Lots of training and meeting with supervisor once a month at least with feedback on calls from the month."
good,Was a great place to work. I had two different Store managers one in which was great and one that was well not so great. Other than that its a good place to work but hard to live if your new to customer service and retail as the pay doesn't start out great.
good,"I like working for Lowes its really what you make. A typical day at work for me usually goes by quickly, because it is a very fast paced environment. The management is cool as far as I know. I have never really had a problem with management. The hardest part about my job is not really being able to satisfy a customer before leaving the store. The most enjoyable, part about my job are the customers they always seem to keep a smile on my face."
good,"Great place to work, 10% discount off of anything, yearly employee events.  Competitive pay. Always some kind of challenge to keep you motivated each day."

good,I worked for this company for 19 years it was a great provider for my family and I highly recommend it for a great place to work given the right situation

good,"Great work environment, fair compensation, enjoyable work that demands as much as you are willing to accept. Whether you want to work competitively to move up the ladder or are comfortable with a secure job and don't necessarily want to enter the world of corporate management, Lowe's would be a great place to work."

good,very family oriented. Will work with you is sudden issues occur. Great benefits and advancement opportunities. Always pushing for advancement of each employee.
good,"Rotaing schedule every 4 weeks 7-4, 8-5, 9-6, 1030-730. Managers do not micromanage which is nice. Everyone is very pleasant to work with. Hardest part of the job would be the constant calls that you have to take and most of them are complaints which can become a bit stressful but overall I enjoy working for Lowe's."
good,"Fun fast paced, semi labor job, overnight stocker and partime electrical specialist. Unloading and loading the semis when they docked. Setting up and dismantlement of  all the seasonal decorations."
good,I loved working there at lowe's the people I worked with was just absolutely amazing. everyone helped out each other when needed. No one had negative attitudes. The management when I was there was great they would actually get out on the floor and help if needed. We was all one big team/family.
good,"Lowes was a great place to work. Always busy, co-workers were pleasant, management was great. Very flexible with hours and understanding of time off. Great company perks."
good,"I started out as a Seasonal employee but easily became permanent after a few months. I love Lowe’s because I love home improvement. The store I work at is clean, most employees are always willing to help out, management has been awesome and the pay is good. Yeah some days we’re short staffed but that’s when I get to learn about different areas of the store. I love a challenge and Lowe’s offers that, both physically and mentally."
good,"Pay could be better, I had a great supervisor, hours were good, worked overnight stocking, relaxed most of the time. I didn't  have to deal with customers."
good,"While working there, I enjoyed the team I had. Lines of communication between departments and between management and team were very open. I gained the skills needed to help customers find the exact product they were looking for to fill their needs."
good,Great job. Only reason I didn't stay was due to the interview process. No matter how hard you worked or how long you've been there if you weren't good at answering their weird questions they had to pick someone that no idea what a hammer was.
good,A typical day would be busy at first then it would slow down. The hardest part is working short handed but the job has to be done the most enjoyable is slow time I learned alot about the job through hands on training
good,"At Lowe's I enjoy working and serving the Customers, I enjoyed doing wood work. It was good to learn something new everyday. The most enjoyable part of the Job was the customers and Co- workers. Some times they where hard to deal with. I learn about the stock market, Home Improvement and construction work."
good,"Lowe's is a good company to work for.  A lot of opportunities in different departments.  Good pay, they care about your family and do their best to work with you if you need to be off."
good,I would help all customers. I learned to work smart not hard.  i rarely had issues with management. It was a very transient place to work.  I was always meeting new people.
good,Good place with a good work environment. Not really a lot of room for advancement. With the res=cent restructuring of management it has really stifled the ability to advance.
good,The employees were very helpful if you needed something taken care of or help with something. The work environment was fun...at times I would have four people lined up to help out.
good,I enjoy working here and love the people I work with. The only reason I am looking at other jobs is because I've been doing this for a very long gone time and I am ready for my next adventure.
good,I really enjoyed the time I worked at Lowes home improvement warehouse. The staff was nice and everyone worked well with each other. Upper management was the issue

good,"This Job is really layed back just a very hot warehouse , Nice people all around you . They feed you and also there's Snack machine all over the warehouse."
good,We try to be a customer services driven as possible. At times the customers become very demanding and you have to have some thick skin at times. Customers will curse at you threaten you at times but most of then time you are able to make a difference is someones day that makes it rewarding.
good,"I describe this job with two words "
good,"It was a great place to work. It felt like a big family, I was sad to leave. The Manager was great, he was easy to talk to and very caring. My coworkers where an Amazing group of people always there to help and teach you new things."

good,"I learned something new everyday about your job, rather it was good or bad. For the most part, it was a fun place to work, and very nice associates. Sometimes their miscommunication, with associates and Management. The hardest part of the job working for Lowe's,is getting everyone on the same page, and working as a team. The most I liked about working at Lowe's was working full time, and love my customers. I enjoy making them smile, and making my customers happy before they reach the exit door."

Lowe's was very unique everybody came together like s family​. I would have to say the hardest part of working at Lowe's was nothing it was a very simple job to me not much you had to do really. The enjoyable part of working at Lowe's was being able learn new things, being able to get along with people I didn't know and last but not least I loved operating equipment."

I learned a lot about the products they sell, and the way customers react to a good environment. My favorite part of working was the fun everyone was able to have while doing their actual job."
good,"Lowes worked with my schedule while I was in college. It pays well, and you will learn a lot working there. I think it is a great company to work for."
good,"I did enjoy my time at Lowe's. I made friends and learned a surplus of valuable skills. Lowe's has more of a team vibe, which makes it easy to ask other employees for help. If they had extra hours available, they would offer them to employees who wanted them."
good,"Lowe's is a great place to work, they offer a full benefit package to full time employees. They are a retail business so hours are base on the business at hand, if you work part time your hours are greatly effected base on the time of year it is."

Additionally, the employees genuinely enjoy their jobs.  It's not often to find employees with 10+ years of tenure in a retail company.  Lowe's is also committed to the professional development of its employees.  It's a GREAT company."
good,"Prepping food, check the date on food "
good,"Overall a good company to work for, like all places, management can really mean the difference in how you progress into the company. A good positive attitude will always move you forward, however."
good,"Everyday was a loaded day, filled with professional customer service, and taking an interest in customer needs. Filling orders, making phone calls to prospective customers and current contracts. Leading my sales team to meet sales goals, and exceeding them. Management was always there for assistance, and would help control any customer concerns. The most difficult part of my job, were things that I couldn't control like, vendor orders, out of stock merchandise, slow business day's, and the weather. Enjoyed my co-workers, helping customers complete and design home projects."
good,"A typical day at Lowes is great, you can learn as much as you can about each department and the collegues teach you a lot.

good,Every day that I came in to work at Lowes I can not say that i had one complaint. All of my coworkers were very friendly and cooperative. My superiors were understanding and kind. I was able to work the amount of hours I requested in order to better support my family as well. The hardest part of my job was getting in routine with the labor of the Lumber department but I think that was a personal issue. Most enjoyable part of this job was learning the store and what it offers and being able to learn how to become a good customer service representative. This is a quality that I will be able to take with me with future jobs.
good,"Greeted customers, shocked shelves with product, guided customers to products they needed, made suggestions to their concerns, Trained new employees, made sure money was correct in cash registers"
good,You needed to know all the different sizes of lumber and paneling. Needed to know the layout of the store so if a customer asks you where something is you can tell them.

good,Enjoyed working w the friendly Lowe's team! Everyone pulls their weight & does their job effectively which makes it better to go into work for the day
good,"Great people to work with (felt like family).  Every day was full of excitement.  Fast pace environment.  There was plenty of training available, so there was never a feeling of nervousness.   As long as you did what was required of you, and you were a team player you had nothing to worry about.  Keeping the customer first mentality is key.  Never be afraid to be the one to make a decision, even if it was the wrong one, it could be fixed.  The hardest part of the job is knowing that you cant make every person you come in contact with happy, so there would be times that you could get dumped on by the customer. Once you learned how to let those experiences go  everything else is a piece of cake."
good,"Good company. Good people. Good Culture."
good,"Love Lowe's! Great company to work for! Worked around my school schedule, gave me days off in short notice, and the pay is great! I recommend this company for anyone!"
good,"I would say that Lowe's as a Company is Great to work for. However Young People will need to be patient and wait to work your way up . Many,  Many people start as part time and eventually work into a Management position.  However you need to be constantly on the Department Manager to make sure they are doing the schedule fair. I closed  4 out of 5 weekends. When I asked Her about why she said ""I'm sorry I didn't look at the schedule. My question is  Why Not? your making it out and I don't see you here all weekends!!!! so just be ware Department Managers are not quite on their mark. But as I stated Lowe's as a Company is a Great place to work. Great Benefits , plenty of paid time off, and lot's of room for advancement."
good,It was a great place to work with great people. management was ok. the work was hard but they train you well. the hardest part of the job was time management. the most enjoyable was helping people with there homes
good,Be prepared to constantly interact with customers & their needs involving everyday shopping and concerns about a project they may be in the process of completing
good,Compañía americana con buen esquema de trabajo y oportunidad de crecimiento

good,"Lowe's is a major home improvement retailer dedicated to its customers, employees and stock holders.  "
good,"I enjoyed working here, it's hard work but if you do a well enough job you get paid extra. The shifts are long but so are your weekends, I only worked 3 days a week but it was full time. One of the best paying jobs around."
good,"Work schedule was 4am to 12. Pulled delivery orders, helped drivers get on the road. Called next day customers and scheduled delivers. assisted receiving with other misc duties. Completed all paper work and submitted load reports to mgmt via excel. Awesome culture feels like family. Management at the store I was at was good, worked with you and wanted employees to move up. hardest part of the job was not having enough tie in the day. Seemed like I would get there in the morning and then it would be over, but that also was the best part as well. Time flew."
good,"I just started my second summer with Lowe's. I worked here before in 2015, but left for a different job. I adore my managers and I really like the diversity that a job like this offers. It's not something that you just meander about and help people. You learn special skills (power equipment, special order services, specialized sales) that can be very beneficial if you ever look for a different job. The main negative is, if you can somehow get full time, you won't have much of a life outside of work. Full time people work long hours almost every day. Some people work 8-10 hour days, 6 days a week. Most people are part time. Even if you've been there for years, you stay at packed hours part time. At least for the store I'm at."
good,"Working for Lowe's is one of a kind. It is the most imperfect, perfect place to work. I learn something new everyday working for Lowe's. The two most enjoyable things that I enjoy most about working for Lowe's is my boss and working with the recruiters."
good,The job i had was lawn and garden loader i was trained on a forklift and other other equiptment i loved my job i wish i could have stayed but they couldnt work with my schedule and it was only part time
good,"Lowe's is a great place to work, the opportunities for advancement are good, the ability to just help the customers with there problems and have the answers for there questions is very rewarding."
good,Was extremely flexible with my college schedule and was always a fun environment to work in. Management was able to assist and teach me out all products sold at Lowes
good,working at lowe's is a balanceing act beacuse you work with a wide verity of people and custmores everyday is different and has it's own challages of stress.
good,Loved working for this company! Sad to go! The staff and fellow employers are great to be around and care about their jobs. It is a great place to try and move up in
good,"Lowe's is a great company with outstanding benefits. Customer focused atmosphere and fast paced. Now for the down side. Short staffed most days especially on the weekends, you will be stretched from department to department including running registers. It's an extremely stressful situation if you are the only one looking after two departments due to call outs, etc. Lack of management structure and participation."
good,Nice place to work on a daily basis many days where busy working with customers or cleaning displays or placing orders for customers. The location I worked had a great management
good,"Challenges employees to better themselves on a daily basis. "
good,Great loved it just needed advancement or full-time to support myself. Had some lay offs right as I left. All I look for in a job is decent pay and managers caring about employees.
good,They treat their employees really well. I started here because they offer benefits to part time employees. I then learned how awesome they are about helping you grow in the company so I stayed.
good,I really do like working at lowes the people are great to work with and we have an awesome management team. I am a little frustrated with trying to get a full-time job there.
good,Very customer otiented friendly work environment. Willing to work with school schedules and managment cares very much about their employees. Would work fir them again
good,"Switchboard operator, assemle daily business.  Later in time helped as cashier.  I was responsible for handing out the paychecks.  The management was easy going, when I first started working there."
good,"serving customers with excellence to ensure they come back again and again. Learn to work with others on good and bad days. With management to complete daily tasks and keeping areas 5 S and always keep safety in mind for customers and team."
good,I've had the pleasure of working at a wonderful company and learning some amazing customer service skills from well trained managers. Most importantly they take the time to explain whatever it is that you need help with and care that you have learned what you need to get all tasks completed efficiently.
good,"managers were very nice and most co workers"
good,"It is a great job if you are a student, there is plenty of room for growth and great company culture. They provide you with a great jumping off point for a sales environment and in general it is a pretty fun team."
good,"Loads, unloads, and moves materials within or near plant, yard, or work site, performing any combination of following duties"
good,at Lowes is so much fun. I love the people I work with and the customers are great. Lowes does offer benefits but you do have to pay for them.
good,"On a typical day my job would begin by breaking down shipments and organizing product based on its destination within the store. Once product was broken down, the team would take the product out on lifts and organize product on the shelf, ensuring the store remained in pristine condition and well organized."
good,My direct manager was both informative and helpful.  He regularly asked for feedback and if there was anything that could be done to help me with my work.  He made me feel my work was important to the company.
good,Good place to work. The people there are all very helpful. The co workers are always available to assist when needed. The management is good and benefits are good.
good,The Store management did so a lot of favoritism. He has retired since then and from what i have seen on tv the company is not doing to good.

good,My favorite part of working at Lowe's was providing excellent service to my customers.  I learned how to put customers at ease especially when a home project was not going their way by helping get back on the right track.
good,"In addition to being promoted within six months, I was able to work in many departments throughout the store, so I learned so many things about gardening, building supplies, appliances, and home decoration. It was fun! I has great co-workers that I still remain friends with today."
good,The management was reasonable and understanding. The work was interesting. Processes and procedures took a long time. The annual salary hike was pretty good.
good,Competitive pay with excellent benefits with a safe work environment that offers opportunity for advancement. Wonderful employer with open door policies
good,"Inspiring, challenging, good work/family balance. Team structured. Senior Management team a pleasure to work with."

good,I came in as a seasonal job and ended up working hard and moving up the ladder of employment. The company has taught me how to handle communication skills.
good,Lowe's is a good place to work and I have enjoyed my time here.  Management staff works with you. Leaving because Lowe's is restructuring and is elimating my position.
good,Lowe's would be the perfect job if not so hostile . Being threatened with your job everyday was not ok . Also if the mad people love where they work it would helpful .
good,"Great place to work. Management great, Co workers are wonderful, the work environment is clean and organized, communication is great amongst employees, and employees and managment"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Ace Hardware, but left to pursue a career with more opportunities and better pay. I have zero complaints about the owner I received another opportunity that paid off for me. A great organization to work for."
good,"A typical day consists of partnering with management to prioritize what is urgent and most important on that particular day. After meeting with a member of management I will walk the department to search for anything out of the ordinary, trucks that may be coming in, searching for and helping any customer I come in contact with and making a list for what I would like to accomplish for the day. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping people love where they live. It may sound cliche but I genuinely enjoy helping people and doing anything I can to make their experience at Lowe's a positive one. The most difficult part of the job is either the inability to work overtime if needed to finish tasks in crucial moments or finding the proper resources to help get the information needed concerning customers orders."
good,"I love my job at Lowes its very rewarding in many ways.The Managers are amazing ,helpful and nice.I love my co-workers they are ready to give to lending hand when needed. You learn new things every day. This is a great place to work at."
good,"My time at Lowe's was a good experience. I enjoyed my customers and my co-workers. I wish that job advancement was a little more attainable, this is the reason why I left the company."

good,"I super enjoyed this company. The store That I worked at, had great management, HR manager, and overall great experience. The only down fall is they let you go before your 90 days are up, and you can't get unemployment."
good,"I love my job at Lowe's. I love my co-workers, management staff and customers. I only wish they offered full time cashier position."
good,"A typical day at work I would show up at 6a.m. and start to load trucks for that days delivery schedule. after that I would log where we were going and the time we would arrive then we would go out on the road and deliver the appliances."
good,I enjoyed Lowes of Muncie. it was a great place to work the people was nice and helpful. the only drawback was the pay and the hours. but it was retail so that is to be expected.

good,Great place to work. Everyone you work with is great. Great hours. Great management. Probably the best place I have ever worked

good,Good compensation and benefits. Lots of opportunities for career advancement. They are very customer focused and I enjoyed helping people plan and accomplish their home improvement projects. The hardest part of the job was the constant heavy lifting (in excess of 50 lbs) and standing on concrete all day.

good,Close company fun energy  knowledgeable folks in every department  folks are always willing to teach you what they know.
good,"I would start the day with seeing where I would be located that day and see who would be there to help if it was needed. I learned how to do returns, take payments, do exchanges, and just day to day routines. Management made sure every one customers and employees had what they needed and fixed things if it was needed such as price adjustments for customers if something was cheaper somewhere else. My co-workers made the days fun and made me look forward to work each day whether it was a closing shift or an opening shift. The hardest part was when we were short staffed and would have lines of customers, trying to be fast and still provided great customer service."

There system needs to be upgraded in a manner that is in today's rush through process. It was hard to know how you, as an employee was performing simply because you are told by your superiors one thing and then, find out differently later.  You do a job and want to continue learning and be as helpful as possible.  Even that is not good enough.  It was a fun job and I am grateful for the experience."

good,"Lowe's of Waco has some great employees but their management needs a cleaning. Some really rude head cashiers, even more rude front end supervisor and the ASMs are mostly a joke that either hide out in the offices or stand around in groups gossiping.

good,"By working there I've learned that team work is very important to succeed in everything you do. Management are easy to get along with and very understanding, also helpful. Co-workers appreciate your help in every way. Sometimes we have our good days, and also our bad days. The hardest part of the job is in shipping, sometimes we get a lot of heavy product on our lines or certain products we can't fit inside the trucks to make walls inside, high and tight, in order for the trucks to make cube and to be shipped off to stores. However the most enjoyable part of the job in shipping, is when all our lines are cleared and we have time to helps others in need if necessary"

At first I didn't think making friends at the work place was that important, but when you work with co-workers, its hard not to enjoy their presence. The hardest part of the job was being the only cashier in a certain area and the lines would become long and customers would become frustrated. The best part of the job was everything, I learned a lot, helped people, and got praised for my great work."

Being that this is a retail company I knew it was important to be respectable to customers and coworkers also. It was a great experience and I also learned how to operate a picker while working there. The only negative is the hours and pay, being that I was new I receive very little hours and the pay reflected that."

After clocking in, you report to your head cashier to see what register you will be put on for you shift. As you know, there are the rules of no cell phones at the register, and you can not leave your register for anything unless there is two of you. I get alone with all my managers. I like the fact that they are all about there business. They  would never make you look bad in front of your customers and they stand behind you one hundred percent when you feel something is wrong in a situation. The co-workers are very nice most of them get alone and we work together in the front end. The hardest part of the job is standing in one spot for a long period of time. The enjoyable part of this job is that most of the time you get the same customers. I have befriended most of my customers and they know me by name. It feels good to have so many people in there that adores you for who you are. I have had many customers that would only come to me when they are ready to check out because they like me so much. But out of everything, I learned that being in the front end or in customer service you have to be very patient with the customers."

Or they just needed that one thing to fix what ever it was they were doing. Or had this grand project they were working on and needed help getting everything for it over the course of time. I couldn't believe how many customers had same common goal or project and went in completely different outcomes. Working there was definitely a challenge worth every head ache. To have customers come back and thank you with pictures or stories about their journey just shows the difference you made in their life. And that is what I walked away with at Lowe's. That's the true Lowe's experience.
good,"Walk in and turn on all machinery, check inventory and replace any products needed. Prepare materials to make the products."
good,"A typical day at Lowes Improvement Store "
good,(NOT Lowes home improvement) a nice little landscaping company located in Grand Blanc i worked at with my uncle for the summer during high school.
good,its a nice place to start working always busy and always things to do. Customers are all nice and easy to handle management are very nice as well . I just enjoy the vibe and environment that comes along with the job. im glad to be a part of it
good,Love the people I work with.  Management is great.  Very customer focused company.  In depth training.  A lot of room for advancement.
good,Great Company to work for. Ability to grow within company in many areas.
good,"I worked in the inside lawn and garden department, aka ""seasonal"", where everything changed at least every 3 months.  This department is not for the weak, or lazy.  It required a lot of heavy lifting, knowledge of outdoor power equipment, resets, seasonal changes, knowledge of the entire store's products, etc...  I learned several things about different products, how to interact with people from all cultures, and most importantly how important great customer service is for the consumer-business relationship.  I have zero complaints about my co-workers at Lowes.  Everyone was always eager to assist me or a customer.  The hardest part about the job was the schedule, but my supervisor was great at making it easier for me to manage working and going through a nursing program.  The most enjoyable part of the job was coming to work and seeing smiles on everyone's faces."
good,"Management focuses on people leadership."
good,Productive workplace with excellent employees. Very family oriented and many ways to advance.
good,"Everyday was something different but the basics were always the same. I was a manager over the cashiers so I ran the schedule and made sure that all cashiers got their breaks and lunches, customer service."
good,"Great place to work, management is exceptional and seem to care about employees."
good,"Lowe's overall is a great place to work. My fellow employees were great and i'm glad to call them my friends. The management team is also very great. I got to know a lot of the customers as they always came back, they knew me by name and i knew them by name. It's a family atmosphere."
good,"I learned a lot of new skills such as operating machinery throughout the store. It was my first retail job, so I learned how to communicate with customers very well."
good,its a good job they offer good pay but if your part time you only work about 2 or 3 days a week.
good,"If you live close enough, working at Lowe's is worth it. Management cannot for the life of them make up  their minds on what they want which can get confusing it is up to each person to learn what to do when each supervisor is working. In general it is a great experience. The other employees are amazing and the customers are really nice."
good,"One of the best places to be at. They worked great with my schedule as well as management really did their job to best benefit. Got along great with all of my co workers, really enjoyed my time here."
good,"The typical day at work is one of the most enjoyable ones. Dealing with the customers of lowe's is quite liberating at times. They make you feel needed and usually appreciated depending on how you approach them. What I learn at Lowe's on a daily basis is on to better support my house hold and others through the knowledge of flooring, plumbing, home organization,lumber, and other aspects on how to improve the home. Even an apartment. My co-workers are the most dependable group of people I have ever worked with."
good,the people that I worked with were very generous and would always try to push me further while I was working there.
good,A normal day is slow in the beginning but gets quite busy around 10:00 AM and slows down around 8:00 PM. I learned a great deal of skills in home improvement and the construction industry. Management was helpful in a lot of customer situations and did a good job delegating jobs that needed to be done. The people I worked with were great the community at Lowes is like no other I've ever worked with. I enjoyed my job all together and the people made it a fun place to work.
good,"I loved working as a cashier at Lowes Hardware.  I loved helping customers and my fellow co-workers.  "
good,"I was taught a whole new computer system, my managers and co workers were always there if I needed help or had a question"
good,As a cashier I was responsible for assisting customers at check out promoting what ever sales and deals we had for the day and giving great customer service since I was the last face they see before leaving the store. Management made this a very fun and competitive workplace by coming up with different ways for advancement and incentives so that we want to do the best job possible. I enjoyed this job because they always made it easy to learn the store and about the store but the hardest part of this job was leaving.
good,Customer focused and training is important. Working with friends in a pleasant environment.
good,"This is a great company to work for, I am just tired and bored with the job from doing it so long. would like to change jobs to learn and do something different. the people I work with are great people, will miss them if I leave. the hardest part of my job now is making sure all the cashiers get the help they need to do there job and make sure they all get their breaks and lunches on time. I do not take breaks very often to make sure everyone else is taken care of. The most enjoyable part of this job is the people having a great day at work, having fun while working."
good,"I really enjoy going to work"
good,Very good job nice laid back environment they are fairly new and they do not have all policys and procedures set in stone yet but over all I wish I could have staid there a lot longer
good,"My typical day at work was starting at opening (if i was opening), and filling the cash drawers. Then working on the placement of each cashier. The next step was getting everyone situated in their work stations, and planning the breaks and lunches. Filling and keeping all the money in the drawers full as needed. After that making sure all the shift people get shuffled around for the breaks properly. At the end of the shift communicating all the relevant information that has occured with the cashiers and front end. if i was closing i would do most of it except filling the cash drawers first and instead empty them and put the money in the drop slot. I learned how to organize my time and do better with problem resoultions. My co-workers and management were all very pleasent and we would have our occasional disagreements but would always find a way to resolve them. The hardest part of the job was managing the time that i was given to write down the scheduals and follow them. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers and employees."
good,"I liked working for Lowe's, it was a good first job experience for me but I'm looking to get back into the workforce."
good,"A great company to work for, great values, and the company values its employees. Great incentives for meeting goals."
good,Communicating with co-workers and customers through out the day. Selling and helping customers find what they need in the store. Working on the cash register and also helping customers load heavy objects into their vehicles. Co - workers were very friendly and very helpful when help was needed. There weren't any hard parts of my job after I was able to learn what needed to be done on a day to day basis. The most enjoyable part of my job was communicating with people and exceeding past expectations.
good,Depending on stores and regions and managers promotions vary.In my store if you are younger than 30 it is hard to move up in my opinion.
good,Manage store with multimillion dollars in sales as well as 100 employees.  The only reason I am wanting to change jobs is because of presently working 70 hours a week with only one weekend off a month.
good,I learned about alot of things I had no knowledge of before and worked with and met some really great people.  Helping others and customers gave me great joy and satisfaction every day.  i always looked forward to going to work.
good,"Acknowledging and assisting customers with inquires. Performed cashier responsibilities. Suggested products for purchase and encouraged additional purchases with upselling tactics. Problem solving decisions resolved for defective and returned merchandise. Oversaw and maintained a well-organized and clean returns department was my typical day. Management was sometimes not as professional as they should be, if you are the last one hired and they have layoffs in the slow time of year and have to cut back you most likely will be let go."
good,"My typical day consists of walking the department and notating tasks that need to be complete to ensure department orgainization and cleanliness.Then I delegate these tasks to my associates to complete by the end of the day. Before the associate leaves I ensure the task has been complete. Also, I faciltate ordering the merchandise in the department and utilize reports to ensure proper ordering. I have learned a copious amount of things in management including utilizing the proper associates to complete difficult tasks. Also, understanding how to properly deal with competing priorities and deadlines. Lastly, learning how to efficiently and effectively manage time."
good,"A typical day starts with pulling all product going out for installs that day. Then you work order management , by calling customers letting them know when their product will arive and by calling vendors to make sure product is ariving on time for install. my co-workers are great .The hardest part of my job is pleasing everyone customers,vendors,installers, employies. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you have made a differenc in a customers life ."

good,Retail is hard to maintain a family live. There is not set schedule of work hours available for most positions.
good,Supervised employees and over seen merchandise while maintaining marketing standards.
good,"As a Cashier, would help direct people to where things where. Ring up customers, the customers would love to chat and inform me of what certain items were used for in their job. "

good,"First time working on Retail, learned a lot,company helps improve your personal life."
good,Cashier mostly but was able to train in other customer service fields within the store.
good,Good fun place to work always had a good day good company to work but not if you need to make more than minumim wage
good,"A typical day at work would be helping unsatisfied customers leave the store satisfied with their experience at Lowe's. I've learned to always be patient with customers and with that customers call the store to give compliments on their experience with me. My co-workers were wonderful, they were the most enjoyable part of the job. I didn't find the job hard in anyway. I honestly loved my job."
good,"My job here was seasonal.  I worked outside lawn and garden.  My basic duties were to come in early and water all the plants.  When the store opened the focus became customer oriented.  I was available and actively engaged in helping customers with questions regarding how, when and where to plant as well as other products that were in the outside garden area.  "
good,This was a seasonal position. I worked outside and inside at times. In the beginning I received full time hours but then was cut due to season change. I didn't really get much opportunity to work any other department on unscheduled days.
good,I ran registers using all forms of payment. greeted guests coming and going at all times. Kept clean and organized work space. Returned merchandise back to the shelves at end of my shift. Lowes was always enjoyable. it had its rough points due to family issues and it had good points. i would work there again.
good,Very great company to work for however the management structure needs improving.
good,Lowe's is a great company to work for. We are like a family and we work together as a team 
good,"A typical work day consists of customer service, supervising cashiers, operating a register, cash handling, solving problems and working in a fast paced envirnoment, cleaning, stocking, taking inventory and some manual labor. I've learned how to provide customer service and how to manage my lower level employees. The hardest part of my job is being on my feet the entire time of my shift, besides the hour lunch, dealing with unpleasent customers and having co-workers not show up or call in. The most enjoyable part of my job would be satisfying the customer on the purpose of their visit.   "
good,"Assisting Customers."
good,"Lowe's is an excellent company that provides high wage, especially compared to other retail companies, and many opportunities to advance and earn experience. The only problem is management. Unlike many of their policies there is not a uniform system of management. This causes absolute chaos and makes working at Lowe's a complete gamble. "
good,I worked at Lowe's for over six years full time while attending college. I worked in every department at one time or another. My most favorite department was outside/inside lawn and garden and the paint department. I really enjoyed interacting with customers and helping with their needs. The employees and management group were good.
good,Working here your co workers treat you like family. My fiance passed and the support that was given to me working here was amazing. There is always room for growth working here they allowed and encouraged you to work your way up the ladder. Great business the store manager was a awesome guy he would listen to your feedback and if you had ideas on improving things they always opened up an ear to listen
good,"The best thing about my job as a sales associate, there was no such thing as a typical day, every day was a new story, some bad, but most of the time the day would end on a good note. Along the way i learned a lot over the course of two and a half years working for the company, I worked most of my time there in the Garden Center and would learn about landscaping techniques, the different types of plants, and how to run a forklift to name a few, and was blessed to have amazing co-workers that I was able to develop friendships with. The hardest part of the job was that i was the one who was left with snow blowing the outside garden area most of the time during the winter months, which would take up most of my shift, if not all of it, and the occasional disgruntled customer who was having a bad day before they even entered the store. The most enjoyable parts of the job though is being able to use my knowledge gained about the products i was selling. to help guide a customer to all the products they needed to finish a home project, sometimes being able to give advice that they didn't know, and to see a happy/content customer."
good,Environment was pleasurable. There was room for advancement and many learning opportunities. They worked well with school schedules to help balance work and personal life.

Rang all customers purchases, returns, invoiced merchandise when needed, answered phones, and all other duties included with being a cashier. I learned that your job is what you make of it. The happier you are, the happier your customers are. Management was ok, they needed to work on their people skills. My co-workers in lumber/Commercial Sales were GREAT, I wish I could work with a team like them all the time. The hardest part of the job was having an hour for lunch.

good,Lowes is a wonderful place to work the overnight team is great and the people are awesome. The only downside is all the policies and procedures they switch constantly which has a lot of backlash when it comes to the back end. But overall I enjoyed my work experience here.
good,"It's hard retail work but employee and customer satisfaction were priorities. The manager rotation schedule is a downside did not take into consideration  days off, did not make for great work life balance. Holiday season was the best in retail as their peak is spring time so I had one if the best Christmases with family ever!!"
good,"I worked there. Nice customers. If you're in the accepted group your golden. If not you're treated like an outcast. I worked very hard there. I did extra things or went out of my way to do extra tasks. The younger working class was sometimes disrespectful. People turn on each other very easily. They pick on you if you have some sort of disability. It can be a,good company but I suggest you keep your mouth shut. And your head down and do your job"
good,"I enjoyed my job very much, I worked in Outside Lawn and Garden. We were always busy. I enjoyed talking to customers about different kinds of flowers and plants. "
good,Lowes offers alot of different work schedules. Not so sure about Job security though. Theres been alot of changes and jobs being eliminated recently. Decent pay
good,"I loved it there. The workers were kind and caring, went out of their way to assure you had a great work experience. Would highly recommend anyone worked there"
good,Very friendly. Train well. Pay well for the job but not if you’re having to drive a distance as I am. Everyone is very kind and they are very supportive of veterans.
good,"Lowe's is like any other fortune 500 company. You are a number not a person. It's like high school with all the rumors. But again, all big stores are like that. You have your good and bad."
good,"Coworkers are friendly and fun to talk to, offer assistance when necessary. Managers maintain a level of professionalism, always responding to customers needs."
good,Lack of HR is disturbing. However it's an amazing place to work. The management team was very supportive and coworkers were great to work alongside with.
good,"A typical day in the warehouse was a lot of work, but the time flew by.  I learned about shipping and receiving and what it takes to keep a store operating.  The management on the most part is great, you always get a few bad apples.  The most enjoyable part was coming in everyday to see my extended family."
good,"Lowes is a great place to work, however it is not something for a single parent. The pay is good but the schedule is not. They should have better options for people who are parents trying to raise kids on their own."
good,Management was always easy to talk to whenever I needed something or if I had any questions. The work environment was safe and very enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was trying to fully understand all of the customers needs on the spot.
good,Lots of lifting  I love it feels like I'm getting paid to work out. Love helping customers . Loading  for them. Enjoy  getting  to work  by 5am. Early  bird you might  say .Work with all types of people  love that. Learning more about lumber  is pretty cool

good,"Great company friendly atmosphere great training always willing to go above and beyond when help"
good,Great mangement. It's a Commission base job but if you like to work that shouldn't bother you. Work by yourself or you can bring someone with you. You can make great money if you work hard an consistently.
good,"Lowe’s is a straight forward job all the managers make you feel appreciated"
good,"On a typical day of work, i sign in and go straight to work . When customers come to my line i always ask how is their day and compliment them on something to make their day better. I usually organized the groceries so i can be faster checking them out , and when i bagged their groceries , it would always be organize. The hardest part of my job , was memorizing every fruit\vegetables or anything that contained a number for me to put in the register . Eventually i started memorizing the basics. The most enjoyable part was helping the customers and knowing i satisfied their needs."
good,Lowes is very team oriented.. There are several opportunities to learn through online learning sites and for the most part you are able to learn other areas. Favouritism was a factor while i was working there and it caused my career to plummet.. I spoke to HR about a hostile work environment and ultimately they told me it was just His word against mine.
good,employees were the best part we all got along and had fun while working. management was was good at least a few managers are willing to help and others didn't
good,"Lowes is a great place to work part time as they are one of a few places that offer sometype of medical benefits, 401K, and other benefits to part time employees. It is often tough to get a full time job or promotion as there are few full time jobs."

good,"Overall a good experience.  Company is lagging behind in technology and in Canada is in a state of transition.  Would benefit from more open lines of communication and lack of tools needed to be more productive are frustrating at times, but company seems to be on the right track addressing these issues.  Availability expectations are pretty standard for retail. Evenings, weekends are required."

good,"Lowe’s is a great and fun work place. Could be a bit unorganized but still fun. However, Lowe’s is filled with nepotism! whoever the manager likes gets away with nearly anything. It’s definitely a double standard in that store. But all together it’s a fine and good work place."

good,It's a great place to work at Friendly people management needs a little bit more communication other than that it is a great place to work at they will work with you with your school schedule
good,"Lowe's is a tremendous company. That allowed me to work from a part-time college kid, all the way to a operations manager when that position was still available. Pay was excellent, promoting from within a plus ! And for the most part managers were allowed to make decisions. I only left because I was looking for a better work to home life ratio. Overall great company"
good,They need to get more organized. The management doesn't communicate with each other and then it gets taken out on the lower level employees I kind of reccomend it
good,I feel I was let go on false information from a co worker. HR has put it in to where I can no longer work for Lowes and that upsets me because I really enjoyed my job and some of the people i worked with. I was there 5 years and loved it all.
good,"Is good place to work but less appreciation they want you to give more than you receiving something else is they don't give chance to your effort , but they have good training experience and good job instructions."
good,Lowes was one of my favorite jobs. I worked as a cashier inside on the front end and in garden when I was needed. I enjoyed the customers and the entire work environment. All staff were always extremely supportive and understanding.  Lowes was great at putting inside promotions to current employees who worked hard for it .
good,I enjoy working at Lowe's.   My only problem is no set schedule. I am a morning person so my preference is opening. You have to check your schedule daily to see if it has changed.

good,I had a run in with my manager. I got married to a military man. My manager wouldn't allow me to take off days for my I'd and so I could move on base.
good,I work outside the team I work with is really great. If I want to learn anything they take their time and show me. I also get kudos quite often. It's nice to feel appreciated.
good,"Great management, employees and customers. Work environment is fast paced but rewarding. Always opportunity for learning new skills and job advancement."

good,"Great place to work, friendly environment and customer friendly. Willing to help you work around other job or family commitments, and the managers are very personal and help to resolve every issue"
good,I really enjoyed working at Lowe’s. I started out as a seasonal employee in November. I was offered a full time position in customer service. They take care of their employees. The benefits are great. I would recommend to anyone looking for a good company to work for. I have a lot friends that work there.
good,Working at Lowe’s had its ups and downs working from 4am to 12pm but I enjoyed the people there they make the workplace a better place to work at for you.
good,Lowes was a very fast paced demanding job. You have to be able to juggle your responsibilities and customers from every angle. Things were constantly going wrong and had to be smoothed over quickly.
good,"I loved working for Lowe's. I mainly worked and managed the Appliances and Kitchen Cabinets departments. I also worked in Flooring, Inside Seasonal, Hardware, Lawn and Garden, and Power Equipment."
good,"typically a day may start off slow and usually the lunch period increases,i learned a lot about  customer care,the most challenging part was responding to the customer needs learning the store,the most enjoyable part was the customers"
good,"unload truck, then stocked merchandise before store opened in the moring. was go good job, good people too. learn how to drive fork lifr, stand up reach, electric pallet jack."
good,"Lowe's has been a positive work environment as it allowed me to develop my skills with my own leadership development, development of my teams, both on an associate level and the management level, tons of 2-way communication, compassion and respect.  "
good,"All of my co-workers were amazing and they were really patient with me in my training. However, working in retail is something I would never do again. Lowe's was an awesome store, you get a good discount and benefits, but the customers...you never know what you're gonna get. I've had some rude customers. My advice: Always remember you have the right to refuse service! Contact another employee or your manager to assist them"
good,"Compañía excelente que inicio lento su proceso de expansión y en los ultimos años traía un empuje excelente y personal muy comprometido, merecía un mejor final en México."
good,This job was one of my favorites & taught me a lot along the way. Not just in the work environment but in life skills as well. Met a lot of interesting people.
good,"It’s a good place to work at. The managers our nice and understanding .You will be comfortable there, the job is not hard and they will teach you how to get the job done."

good,"i enjoyed every minute i worked there! the people i worked with were always possitive and friendly,the work was pretty easy and comfterable,easy schedules."
good,"In 2006 Lowes was a really good place to work, it changed over the years. Eliminating long term, knowledgeable employees to hire part-time, inexperienced to save a few dollars was detrimental to customer service. Eliminating employee benefits little by little and cutting staff was detrimental to store moral. The hardest part of the job was the heavy lifting and the hard concrete floor eight hours a day. The best part was long term friends I made and interacting with all the pets allowed in the store, they would really make your day.  In my store, #2436, we had a great management team. They would listen to concerns, help if possible, but get you an answer if they didn't know. If a person isn't willing to work hard and be nice to customers, Lowes isn't the place for them."
good,I believe it really depends on the store you work in....my store we are like family we help each other out be it job or customers....any job is difficult....
good,"I enjoy working at Lowe's however, the pay is not enough to survive on. I wish they would compensate by how hard a person works not by yearly increases. I was full time but dropped to part time to work else ware."
good,I love my job and the people I work with.  Greeting the customers and tending to the needs makes me smile when at the end of the transaction or customer experience I know that I did my job and customer left happy.
good,A typical day at the Lowe's Store Support center includes speaking with customers and store members regularly.  You learn great customer service skills.  The workplace culture is relaxed and metric driver.
good,I would recommend anyone to work for Lowe’s they’re a great company and also well rounded professional and great. Working for Lowe’s they actually care about you and your well being and the managers are great and flexiable with you as well they make sure you’re getting your hours and etc. but I would most definitely recommend anyone .
good,"High customer turn over due to low pay and lack of care for employees."
good,"good place to work,frendly managment,co-worker helpfull,nice"
good,"Unloading freight, and constant interaction with customers.  Lots of working with your employees and coaching/training on new equipment and procedures."
good,good work place energy and vibe. customers were nice and the employees were always there to help other employees do their job or teach them something.
good,work about 8 hours everyday sometimes 7 or 5 hours have to show up on time and be available to work hard have knowledge of where products are located in the store. as a cashier found and handle money accuracy is important have to be able to lift products and keep area cleaned and well maintained. I like having closing shifts.
good,I worked at the Zion store next to the mall in Fayetteville Arkansas had to leave because my little girl needed mommy on the weekends. It was an amazing place to work I had a great team that I worked with felt like I had a lot of freedom in the job did not agree with the power our thing when we had to go on the floor expecially when I have a lot of cabinet job that I had to bid and I my hours were 10 to 7 so power was were from 10 to 2 then if I was lucky enough to get a lunch because we were so busy and had to cover a lot of other departments I would only have a couple of hours each day to do cabinet beds that is a little bit bad but love the culture loved my manager and I have really nothing bad to say about Lowe's it was a wonderful place and I'm sad that I had to leave. And if anybody starting out for a new career get hired as a seasonal you'll love it and they'll love you back good full-time get that 401k buy some stock great benefits and everything else there's really not a bad thing I wished I was still working there but my daughter needed me and that's more important in my life right now but I will go back to work for Lowe's if I have to absolutely.

good,"The Lowe's I worked for was very family oriented and done their best to work around your schedule if needed and the hours were really well, as well as pay. I was part time and they offered part time benefits which was really nice. Also they acknowledged your work ethic and threw company parties which was nice!"

good,The atmosphere at lowes is always a good one. They have a great safety program.  The benefits are good. I thought about going back to work for them again.
good,"I had the challenging days where customers would put in complaints over small things, now thanks to some help, it wasn't too bad. I always knew how to be flexible when it was busy. I was also ood at advertising sales in the department as well."
good,"Lowes was fast paced and very competitive, it taught me operations and finance that came useful in the medical claims. loss prevention at Lowes was more operations, inventories, internal audits."

good,working at lowes was a great experience i worked as a cashier and a customer service associate and as a delivery associate and learned a lot and i also  got to work around a lot of good people and got to learn so much like what a customer is needing but doesn't no how to find out where to look for it or what product is better to use.

My occupation is all about providing water for plants and load heavy purchases for customers, I have learned so much about working outdoors, how to take care of certain flowers and so many different kinds of plants and soil. I also learned how to be more customer focus and taking the attentive in doing things. The most enjoyable part of the job is watering flowers and learn about them."
good,I had great co-workers and the team members where great. The pay was competitive. I just had a hard time with the rotating shifts. I was always tired. I also missed a lot of family functions. Because if the hours I worked.The benefits where good.
good,"I always work on something either down stocking, top stocking, labels or pulling orders. Sometimes management tends to be somewhat on some employee's side, or favoritism which keeps you from growing or getting a position based on your qualifications (knowledge, experience, will to work hard)."
good,"I had worked in another Hardware company but learned more mad skills while working at Lowes, I learned some valuable lessons there, some good some bad"
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowe's but it's not for everyone. It can be very hands on and there are a lot of customers with a lot of different issues, so if you aren't prepared to deal with customers this may be difficult for you.

good,I enjoy working t Lowes. The benefits are amazing and I love dealing with the customers as they come in the door. The customers are what truly keep me going each and everyday.
good,"Lowe's is a great place to meet new people, and learn new things. It can be fast-paced certain time of the day which makes it fascinating. Some days will be hard, but its worth it."
good,Lowes cares about employees and takes care of them. Hard work and can be frustrating. They listen to you and do their best to help when they can. Some managers on the store level are not as good as others.
good,"I worked there as a seasonal employee originally assigned outside, but moved indoors due to an allergic reaction to something that was left unidentified. Although i enjoyed being indoors far less than being in the sun, the job was enjoyable no matter where I was placed. Though ultimately, I was comfortable not continuing and I made as much known."
good,Enjoyed working with the others in my department and store. I personally had excellent training in many departments due to my position during my first year as a part-time floating customer service associate.

good,It is a good place to work. They are in the process of fine tuning their company to make it a great place to work. Management are willing to listen to your needs.
good,All the employees were easy to get along with and we all worked together as a team. The management was easy to work with if you needed help with something or requesting a day off if needed.
good,Lowes is a very great place to work for. Ive been here for almost 11 years and dont plan on leaving anytime soon. Management is good and the pay is good

good,I LOVE LOWES Management us caring and supportive. They have a business to run and hold people accountable. I love the opportunities to grow with the company but also the opportunity to grow outside the company. I can get free training and certification for a trade program and they even give me resources for apprenticeships. Tuition  reimbursement and college discounts. I cant complain growth opportunities are there. Schedule is rough but other than that I love Lowes.
good,"Lowes is a good company to work for if you have help and coverage."
good,"a typical day at work - unload trucks"
good,Must have flexibility for all kinds of scheduling. Expect to be on your feet 24/7. Great benefits and competitive wages. Expect to be busy on all holiday weekends and days.
good,Working for Lowe's has given me the tools and knowledge to move forward with my life and further advance my career. The company has taught me better teamwork as well as learning to work in difficult situations.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my day was being able to put a smile on my customer's face before they left, leaving a good impression of Lowe's. I learned a lot because I sought out information. In the beginning, I got all the overtime hours I wanted and I closed, so I helped out in plumbing.  I had a friend teach me the store i-pod, SEMA system way of finding the correct place for each item and would dump out all of the wrong items and try finding their places. ""Cowboy"", the Plumbing Pro loved me.  I was very OCD about getting things in the right place which helps with inventory. When times were slow at the register I would seek out missing prices and price discrepancies. I kept after management until someone had time to show me how to make prices from start to finish. No one likes to look at an item and not know the correct price!"
good,Fantastic place to work but pay doesn’t cover cost of living in Tx amazing insurance and benefits and discounts managers are awesome and are willing to work with school schedule
good,Management went above and beyond to help train their employees. The café offered a full service café line which operates all day. The job itself was easy to learn and management trained crew members in multiple departments
good,"Very fun place to work, its hard to find good help which puts a strain on us who actually break our back at this place. Wages are a bit low and favoritism can come into play. Just do your job listen to management and you have yourself a career. Plenty of room to grow"
good,I like the workers and atmosphere and the managers are very flexible. It’s a very good hours and benefits plus 401k. Good opportunities to get raises.
good,"Job was stressful but overall management was super nice and helpful. For a Call Center environment, was very typical but has a great facility to work in.  Would recommend for anyone that likes this type of work."
good,Lowes is a very friendly place to work and to give opportunities to people with eagerness to learn and grow professionally. I am grateful for my time at Lowes.

good,I loved everything about Lowe's except the location and the hours available. On a typical work day i would take inbound calls from customers calling in typically because their major appliances are needing servicing. Lowe's was very family oriented they offer many options and are always changing. The benefits were good and I feel like they really try to listen to their employees needs.
good,This is one of the best places I have worked. It is retail hard but the comradery makes the days bearable. The days are long but benefits are worth it. They recognize employees and try to make the work day fun.
good,"I absolutely LOVE working for Lowe's as a company. If I wanted to stay in retail I would be here for life. It is a great place to work. The management team makes me want to work my hardest every day and really makes me feel apart of the team. I recommend Lowes to anyone looking for a job. I wish I had known about this company while I was in college. The company I worked for back then was not as good although I met some really great people. Lowe's employs seasonal college students every summer.   Great benefits, great management teams, great opportunities for growth and development if you work hard and can prove yourself. The company as a whole is very family oriented. We pride our self on helping others make a house a home and within the walls of all our buildings we want employees and customers a like to feel like they are home."

good,Worked at the new one was a good store but not making money good people to work with very customer friendly always helped everyone out and a lot of good customer feedback
good,"Most everyone was super friendly and helpful, lots of workplace gossip though. Definitely seemed that they wanted to take care of their employees, my manager continuously asked for my approval of my work schedule to ensure that I was happy with it and okay with my hours.

However, as a large retailer, they exceed in their pay and treatment of their employees, and are currently demonstrating a big push to position the company for a rapidly changing business environment.  For my particular function, I've had great support and encouragement from management."
good,"just looking for a full time job to spend time with my family, this is a great company to workfor if you are a single person would love working herefor life but would love to spend rest of time here but god and family comes first"

good,The most enjoyable part is helping people. The culture there was awesome. Everyone tried to make you feel like part of the family there. I learned patience at Lowe's.
good,"A typical day consisted of walking around and asking customers if they needed help while simultaneously stocking shelves and doing inventory. The days go by fairly quickly with so much to do, but it doesn't feel overwhelming. If you work in Outside Lawn and Garden, expect to get dirty and a bit sunburnt."
good,"Love the working there have good people to work with......Hours was good pay was ok......Made some good friends....."

good,"As a runner i am to move product form the recieving dock to certain spots of the warehouse. Either at an endcap, or in a putaway location. With the variety of pallets, some were full pallets. Others splits, which mean you had to individually put away the boxes in the location."
good,It can be stressful in the fact you have a lot to get done in not a lot of time to get it done in. The people are great and the company does really care for there employees.
good,"the management was kind and considerate.  They were flexible with my student schedule.  Didn't seem like a lot of people moved up in the company while I was there.  There were also people who were let go who had worked for 15+ years there for ""restructuring"".  Other than those quirks, it was a nice work environment."

good,"This was probably my favorite job I’ve worked worked. They treated me fairly and were always inquisitive about how I felt about my job and cared about their employees, always going out of their way for them and me. It can be a tough and demanding job at times, especially at the Lowes I worked that had the 4th highest grossing income in the United States. Which meant it was always busy and fast-paced, but that just made it more enjoyable for me. Over all a fantastic place to work with even better crew members and staff. I miss the place as soon as I left. If the opportunity arises and they have another opening, I would work there again in an instant."
good,"Drive the building each day before shift starts. Walking the floor before going to the office to follow up on emails. Meet with the management team to assess the daily duties and any opportunities. Meet with my associates to go over goals for the day. I learned that communication is the key to success an d can make your job so much easier. Associates and management work hand and hand with what is expected.. The management team communicate with each other in huddles, meetings and through emails. The workplace has to be a friendly environment to the associates as well as the customers. Management has to promote the at all times through leadership. The hardest part of Home Improvement is trying not to make any big mistakes on something a customer invested in. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know the customers and the smile you put on their face by doing a good job for them."

I worked in the outside lawn & garden department but helped in other departments if needed. I would assist customers with their purchases, and help them make the right decisions to meet their needs.

good,Lowe's is a great place to work if you're a young student or an elder. There's a position for everyone there. I never had a problem with any coworkers. If you are part-time then you probably won't have much hours. That is probably the only downfall to the job.

I had six years vested in my position and never planned to leave when Lowe’s Corporation eliminated all Delivery Driver roles in targeted markets that included mine. My position was eliminated as of August 18th, 2017 to be outsourced to Schneider Trucking. All employees and management were one big Lowe's family. We worked hard and played hard during company sponsored events as well as private parties among staff. My Lowe's family supported me and my family both emotionally and financially, and also continuing my health benefits when I was in a life threatening scooter accident."

good,"I enjoyed working at lowes, it basic retail, i worked as a cashier and customer service representative and the hardest part was dealing with certain customers.  Lowes was a great place to work and the staff and managers were friendly"
good,"After many management changes over the last year, Lowe's created Service Managers and depleted Department Managers, through this we are currently experiencing over tasked and under staffed.  It seems as tho we have more Chiefs than Indians which brings great pressure to all employees in the location.  The moral is down and the turn over has increased tremendously.  There seems to be very high demands and a lot of accountability however there are not enough hours in the day to complete the daily tasks directed.  We work hard long hours and I think we are very underpaid for our job performance."
good,"Typical retail job. Pay is above average, with possible quarterly bonuses based on sales and customer service. "
good,"very productive job environment, and great team oriented good place to meet people from all walks of life,and was able to help many people with all their projects needs."

good,Not much to say about the company work your way up ask for hours and you'll get them great mentors for every department and never be afraid to ask managers for help
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers and assisting them with their needs. Dealing directly with customers to overcome ordering or return problems was where I worked often. Associates were friendly, management was helpful, ongoing meetings and training and yearly reviews. Retail can be more hectic at certain times of year of course."
good,"Quality employee care, the only suggestion I would make is for there to be a security guard/ officer at the exits to check customers who may be stealing."
good,Managers suck a lot but your co workers are going to treat you like family. They will help you out alot especially when the managers won't. The way lowes managers operate sucks in general.

good,All the managers are super friendly and are willing to go out of their way and help no matter how busy they are. If you have a problem they are all ready to listen

Everyone is currently on edge and feeling unsure about their positions.  The management team I work with is a high functioning and great team; I truly enjoy everyone throughout the organization.

good,"A typical work day for me started at 5:00 am. I would clock into work and count the safe for the start of the work day, pull the register tills and assist the Head cashier prepare the register tills for the day. I would spend the next few hours counting and preparing the previous day balance for bank deposit and filling the next day register tills. I learned that you must have patience when dealing with the public and coworkers. The hardest part was coming in on my off day for meetings. In all I enjoyed my job and the people that I worked with."
good,"great company. there is work for whom ever wants it, definitely cares about their employees which is amazing because most retail businesses focus on customers more than their employees"

good,Working especially around the plants is a very healing experience.  Helping customers find the right plants for their landscaping and gardening projects is fun.

good,Started as a seasonal employee and was quickly promoted to a permanent position.  Within my first year I was interviewed for a management position.  They are very loyal and treat hard working employees very well.  Lack of manager involvement is a good thing and means you are doing your job correctly.  One of the more enjoyable work environments I've been in.

good,"A typical day at Lowe's is helping customers with their projects, answering calls about products, solving customer problems. The management is great, co-workers are fantastic. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers but I dealt with it to the best of my ability. The mot enjoyable part was satisfying the customers."
good,The Lowes Corporation is a very good company to work for and is going to be around for a very long time. I would defiantly recommend this company to others.

good,"used to have great benefits, but its been awhile since i worked there so it might be different. Nice people to work with. Physically demanding work."

While I was a part-time employee, I did have vacation time off, and a flexible work schedule.  There were times when I was asked to work additional hours, which helped me out."
good,"Lowe's is a family, no matter the state you reside. Each store help' s not only it's employees but the community of which they host. The team members are just that, a team.

good,"I love working here. And when we're not working hard, they have games and activities in the break room. Takes the load off!"
good,Lowe's foods cares about their employees and help them in any way possible. Scanning items and meeting new people every day was a plus and seeing the diversity. Management and co-workers both strive to make sure that every one is in good hands. Although the hard part is to keep conversations short the best part was learning new recipes.
good,After my first experience in retail - I find Lowe's a very gratifying and interesting place to work.  Management is supportive in helping the associates move up the chain.
good,The first place I ever worked where the management staff treated me with respect and fairness. I have made some great friends over the course of my employment here and was able to walk away in very good standing with the leadership team.

It felt like being part of a family more than being part of a company, which made my job all the more enjoyable.  Some days it was stressful, but when does a job come easy?"
good,"It's a fun place to work make's you learn new thing's and get to know good people, the customer's are you average customer's looking for help and buying and I was there to help whether it was big or small I did it all, kept everything in tack, my co-workers were there to help me if I needed help and so was the manager everyone was nice there it was a very good place to work, the best part of was to actually help people and learn a thing or two like building, forklift driving and planting but the hardest thing was to find something to do I was always getting thing's done a bit faster than other's because I love to work and that's why Lowe's is a good place to work."

good,you work a eight hour day the job is staying very busy communicating with customers. the co-workers are great.THe hardest part of the job is not staying busy it makes the day long.  the most enjoyable part of the job is not having to stay inside the building all day.
good,Lowe's is a fun and exciting work environment with a family atmosphere. I love it there and i highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great job.
good,"Lowes Home Improvement is a pretty good day most days.  Clock in, go to your department. Make sure no customers are in need for help. Then you start looking for neatness of dept.  Continue helping customers as they come in.  Management will come through your dept. throughout the day to check neatness.  The hardest part of the job, is keeping up with stock, customers, & neatness of dept. till close.  And finding help when you need it.  The most enjoyable part of the job for me was meeting new people and friendly faces.  Just like other jobs, keep up the good customer service."
good,Awesome company to work for; employees and managers are very understanding. I enjoyed working as a team with my fellow co workers.
good,"Lowes has a great environment, that allows everyone from each department o work effectively. A normal day of work includes either opening or closing the department, which is usually done with one other individual. The ASM's are great to work with, incredibly friendly and personable."

good,"- i learned how to use the forklift "

good,typical day at work dealing with customers that are either looking for a certain item or needs help with a certain problem at home. Very easy job
good,Lowe's is a overall good place to work. The company cares about their employees. The only  draw back will be the scheduling. You get 7 days out of a month off. You only get (1) full weekend off a month.
good,"Working for Lowes was a great experience.. If it wasn't for me having to relocate I'd still be employed there. Lowes took as much care of their employees as they did their customers. Within a couple months I'd worked in more then 3 different departments within that store. I was always learning something new in regards to either a product,customer service skills, or even just shelf maintenance. The work environment was safe well lit and clean, and it seemed all the employees were all customer service oriented which made the work day go more smoothly."
good,"fun work place, management is great, fast paced, a wonderful 1st job, handled large sums of cash, worked front desk, sold lotto tickets, assisted in stocking, cleaned restrooms, pretty much did everything. Really easy job, and a great place to work"
good,I never had any problems at all with this company. they were very welcoming to me as a new employee. if I had any question or concerns they always heard me out.
good,"Although you may have to work some holidays, the company made sure to compensate you by bringing you food. Bonuses available and the company in general supports it's employees."
good,Wonderful place to work where you are in control of your own destiny.  You are reviewed and promoted based on your personal work and work ethic.
good,"Great place to work, management could be alot better. Co-workers  are great, always helpful and hilarious and very professional. When customer traffic slows down, would be one of the best parts of the day, very relaxing."
good,co-workers are very caring & they work very safe. the most enjoyable part is I get to come to work and have fun while working.
good,"A typical day is spent assisting customers with any needs, helping cashiers with any technical issues, money handling, promoting a positive work environment with coworkers, promoting sales and credit programs, loss prevention, schedule management, and communicating with superiors.  I learned how to spot a scam, lead a team, manage many tasks at once effectively, and solve customer service issues.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with shoplifters and scammers and having to enforce corporate policies that I disagreed with.  I really enjoyed interaction with my coworkers including the store management as well as with our stores regular customers."
good,"Great place to work. You can move up with hard work. Compensation is good, especially with experience, as well as all the benefits they offer are good. (401k, health, vision, etc)"
good,"A typical day started at 6:30am in any of my 14 locations.  I use the earliness of the day to catch up on emails and print reporting that I would need for the day.  This allows me to have a somewhat cleared plate to focus on the needs of the store, the employees, store management and my direct report.  Approximately 3/4 of my day was spent on the sales floor: teaching, training and interacting with the associates to assist them with whatever their needs were.  The last part of my day was spent talking with store management on what was accomplished that day, and if there were any areas of opportunity that needed to be addressed or if they needed my assistance with anything while I was in the store.  Individualized safety and shrink related meetings were also part of my schedule.  There were so many things that I learned in my 11 years with Lowes that it would take more time and space than you would probably care to read.  I will sum it up with these few words: team, family and results driven.  My Lowes team was a true family to me.  I spent more of my time at Lowes than I did at work, and that drove me to realize that in order to have an effective, happy and results driven team they had to be part of a family.  You do what needs to be done for family - makes you work harder.  My co-workers were some of the best within retail.  Always there to lend a hand to help if you needed anything and ready to help you dig in if you couldn't find the answer to a problem.  As most of you have probably had during your working career, you have some really great bosses and some not so great."
good,This job includes unloading stock from semi trucks and palletizing. Palletizing does become boring but its about a 5 hr job. So plenty of down time throughout the day. This is an evening job and you will work every sunday.
good,"As a cashier right when i go to my register that is assigned to me i make sure i have all the supplies i need for example, scissors, tape, and recipe paper. I then turn on my light and start helping out the customers by offering them a Lowes credit card so the can save money. Another way i help out the customers is by asking them once they are at the register if they need help with anything at the end i double check to see if they were satisfied shopping at Lowes."
good,great company to work for and ability for advancement is endless. great benefits and 401 plans. would recommend this company to anyone
good,"excellent pay, great benefits, management connects with employees on a daily basis, terrific Team Players, I hated to leave."
good,I have gained a lot of knowledge and great work experience working for this company. I enjoy working as a team and also making sure we fallowed all company guidelines
good,"A really good company to work for, just not a lot of room to advance! The employees in this store are really good. We are all like a family and everyone is willing to help whoever in need"
good,Overall a good company with great benefits. Hit a glass ceiling and was required to do more work than my position entailed but the company of my co-workers made it worth wild.
good,"Fun and comfortable to work, great company culture support from upper management. Great place to work and learn and challenge yourself."
good,While i was here The environment was fantastic the people were friendly (both associates and customers) the only thing i cant say good about this place is they only offered part time hours. i loved this job because of everything else.

good,"Typical duties were to: "
good,"Very busy and productive place, always looking for ways of improvement and how people not bad. very on your feet job, unless your driving a forklift all day."
good,A typical work day is most of the morning cleaning and any minor maintenance as needed. I've learned a lot about inventory and the safety culture. Everyday is a learning experience.Co-workers are helpful and knowledgeable. The hardest part of the job is cleaning after the employees. The most enjoyable part is the celebrations thrown for the employees.
good,Inside of Lowe's is sunny and 70 degrees everyday. There is no such thing as a bad day when you work here. Employees try their best to make sure you're having a good day.
good,"I have been very proud to work for Lowes and really enjoy what I do.  I take pride in my work and feel as though my team does also.  Lowes has a big heart and helps with disaster relief which I feel is a great support for those in need.  You can move up relatively fast in the company if you choose to work hard and learn, learn, learn."
good,Just worked on a seasonal part time basis unloading and loading trucks and delivery of goods. Made sure all product was properly checked in and moved to proper floor areas. Was only a job till I found full time position.
good,Loved the company from the pay to employees and management. work was easy and customers were nice and polite never had any problems with anyone.

good,"Lowe's is where my customer service skill took off. Working as a Customer Service Desk Associate at Lowe's was the best ever. The associates at that location where like a family and we work as a team. As a customer service associate, you have the pleasure to see how people act. My experience as a customer service associate begins at Lowe's and it taught me to be very patient, understanding, caring and kind to my customers. Oh, this is the Lowe's at Largo."
good,"I start off with reviewing the pervious days refunds and bill out of merchandise. I would then plan my week, I have counts that need to be done, ensure that the departments complete their counts in a timely manner.

good,"Help customers and sell product, Learned a lot about home improvement, Everyone had an positive attitude. Hardest part of the job was to deal with loading customers. The most enjoyable part was you can advance at a quick rate."
good,"An open, and friendly environment.  The business cycle is influenced by the seasons, and time of the week/month, so it will become very fast-paced. Management is supportive of staff. They encourage you to put your best foot forward. As a corporation they provide benefits, including vacation to part-timers. Part time employees  also have the ability to receive the quarterly bonus. My greatest satisfaction in working for Lowe's is being able to assist customers in completing home projects and pursuing hobbies such as gardening."
good,"Clock in, check the schedule start stocking, cover breaks lunches. Assist with overrides, change for registers.Do what needs to be done. I do like working here, great employees. Would like to do something that is not so physical."

My co-workers and management are all great people and we do our best to work together to make our dreams become success.

Also opened and closed store, retrieving cashiers money bags, scheduling daily cashier assignments, cashiering, and additional head cashier duties as necessary. I learned a lot about hardware and decorating ideas, as well as better ways to work things out when customers were not satisfied. Managemnt was excellent, and helped when needed and answered any and all questions from co-workers or ones that we could not. Honestly, there was nothing difficult about this job. The most enjoyable was meeting people, helping them, and learning of the projects they were working on."
good,Lowes is an excellent company to work for with lots of opportunity for advancement. I have made several friends since working there and most are like family.

The hardest part of the job is learning about the new customers and how they think. Most enjoyable part is seeing the smiles on the customers faces when they see how much we really care about there needs."
good,Lowes is a great retail environment that I would recommend to just about anyone over the age of 18.  The environment is busy at times but the other employees help make the days more than bearable with the fun times you will encounter at the place of employment.  The best time to work there is in the summer because its the peak season.  Granted it can be very busy at times but the busy days roll by faster than you would think.  Lowes offer a variety of positions from grounds keeper to department managers.  There is always room to advance as long as your performance reflects that you are capable of maintaining the new position.  I highly recommend Lowes as an employment opportunity.

The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people and learning new things on a daily basis.

good,Great place to work. The job i chose is not getting enough hours but im trying to change that
good,"The only thing I don't like about this job is the schedule.  It is not regular enough for my lifestyle.  Other than that, you stay busy and if you want to advance there are a lot of opportunities.  I am a Sales Specialist so my favorite part of the job is the great customers I meet and get to work with, and the worst part is the difficult customers.  There is no such thing as a typical day here but definitely enjoyable."

good,A typical day at Lowe's is very physical for receiving associates. The lesson that you learn at lowe's is that you can be very helpful to customers even though you are a receiving asssociate. Manaagement is very understanding about the different type of situation that arise while stocking the store. The co-workers are very knowledgeable and are always willing to lend a helping hand. The hardest part of the job would be enduring the heat in receiving during the summer and keeping yourself looking respectable even though you've been sweating very hard.  The most enjoyable part of the job is coming to work at 4am.

During a typical day at work I can be at various cash registers and or the ruturns counter where we take returns, or the customer service counter where people pick up internet orders, special orders or they fill out credit card applications.  At the customer service counter we also answer all incoming calls.  I like to work at the lumber counter where we help contractors,  Its always busy at Lowes and I like that.  I would like to stay, however I'm only a seasonal employee and they are hiring mainly part time.  I need to work full time."

We are very lucky at our store we have a great management team they  are always available to help out where ever needed and they  make employees feel appreciated.  We are like a big family , my co-workers are just awesome people ,we have cookouts we do pot luck nightsits all good."

good,Lowes is a great place to work. They have been very good to me. There is room for growth and stability.
good,"I always enjoyed coming to work at Lowes because I never knew what kind of customer I was going to help that day.  I remember a lady looking for larger screws to replace the ones in the hinges that were loose on her closet and bathroom doors.  She said they were waddled out.  Once I explained that a larger screw would interfere with the hinge  closing properly, she said that she had been thinking of drilling out the screw holes and nailing in round dowels to fill the hole. "
good,Getting customers the appliances they need to fill a new home or just for a remodel of a kitchen or laundry room.
good,Constant customer assistance throughout work shift. Assist customers on home improvement projects. I have learned different aspects of retail. Management is knowledgeable and eager to assist CSA's to develop management skills. Co-workers are knowledgeable within their department and willing to assist customers throughout other departments as well. Being courteous to unruly customers at the same time trying to satisfy their needs. Providing great customer satisfaction that will keep them coming back.

I started as a part-time cashier while going to school and within 9 months was approached by senior management about other job opportunities & advancements. I was promoted to a head cashier quickly.  About 6 months later I applied for an entry management training program the company offered (free of charge) and was accepted. I completed the program and was promoted to Department Manager.  I performed as a Department Manager for 2 1/2 years, and was given opportunites to work in various departments to develop more experience. I then applied for a Senior Management Training Program, was accepted, and once I completed that course I was eligible to apply for Senior Management Positions within the company.

By the age of 25 I was a Senior Manager with a very successful Fortune 50 Company! "
good,"Assisting customers is a must. I learned that being helpful to other employee's is not only good for them but it gets noticed on your behalf. Management is down to earth and implements just enough pressure to get the job done but not to much as to make it uncomfortable. my co-workers are cool, a few that works harder than others but cool! The hardest part of my day is mid-day when there's a rush and I have freight to complete. My mos enjoyable part of the day is when I know I've did my job by assisting a customer until they are down with they're shopping list and more."
good,If not for another job I would still be there. I miss it. the Manager was the problem he would not get me the help in dept that was required. after I quit her was demoted
good,Each day my team unloads a tractor trailer filled with store product and arranges them according to their related department on a series of pallets. It can be dangerous and physically demanding but it is very low stress. Management is very effective easy going. Probably the best job i have had thus far.

I learned that i can communicate well with customers and i learned a lot about home improvement and know the products in my department and knowing what the customer needs for there home. The management staff are great they work well with my school schedule. The hardest part about my job is lifting heavy items by myself.
good,A typical day at work in Lowes is a culture of safety first. Customer focus is key. The business has been built through the team. Without them there is no success.
good,Lowe's was a great company. I learned a lot of new things working here. The employes were great and everyone got along well. A typical day at work for me was security stacking products. I managed and cleaned underneath the canopy.

good,"put up freight and make sure merchandize is available for customer to purchase."
good,"A great to work.  I learned more there than I did when I was at HECHINGER INC. of GlenBurnie.  HECHINGER cloes up after being there for more than 15yrs.  I was in management with HECHINGER for the paint dept.    Coworkers were great to be around with no nagging,no one called out unless it was necisarry,  we worked as a team, and we got the job done.    There was no hard part of the job, everyone worked together.   The most enjoyable part of the job was getting overtime loved it a lot.   Sometimes I would put 30-35 hrs. overtime a week plus my 40hrs.regularly."
good,I enjoyed going to work each day because I would meet such a diverse group of people ( IE: John Q. Public). My co-workers were mostly a pleasure to work with. I learned to never assume each customers needs were alike. Management seemed to want to work with you and help make your job pleasant.
good,"Productive all day long assisting customers, stocking or downloading shelves, helping fellow employees, training and changing departments when needed."
good,"Great Place to work, good pay. Manager is not as friendly as former manager. A lot of hard working people work there and a lot of lazy people work there."

good,overall a good experience learning the register and handling customer concerns as well

good,a typical shift is a productive and effective day yet completed with safety as a top priority well managed
good,"I worked at Lowe's in Athens, Ga for five years and really enjoyed it. Once you get over that it is retail and all the negative things that go with that (less than desirable hours and some terrible customers) it is a great place to work. My management was great. They were always willing to work with employees and help out on the floor. They were also very supportive. There was also a lot of opportunity to move up into sales positions and then into management positions. The people hired into the stores were great. The HR manager from my store always did a great job picking the right people for the right positions. The benefits offered to full time employees were decent. They were great, but they were good. They offered health, dental, vision, 401K matched up to 10%, vacation, additional holiday, and sick time. I learned a lot of skills working there such as receiving, inventory management, and merchandising."

good,"Watering plants, waitin on customers and doing little odd and end jobs.  The part I liked the most was interacting with the customers and the part that was the hardest trying to stay warm in the winter"
good,"A typical day at Lowes,  I would arrive at Lowes with my mind and heart set on achieving the goal that that was set before and a willingness to help customers and co workers in any way I could. The main things I did was help customers locate the desired building materials in the Lumber Department that would meet their building needs. Also helped load the merchandise they purchased if needed. Between customers I would keep shelves straight and floor clear or debris. I also worked some hand tools and pallet jacks. I also helped out in receiving when needed."
good,I had an awesome experience there great co workers. Management was alright some were very good mangers and some lacked management skills. Hardest part of the job was waking up at 4 am to start work.  most enjoyable part of job was helping customers.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Lowes it was a great experience, I wish i had a permanent job instead of a seasonal."
good,"Management is OK, customers are very demanding, but that's retail today.  There is always something to do which makes the day go by quickly except when it's slow. I get great satisfaction"
good,Great company to work for great pay and environment. They have a great open door policy.
good,"I was able to move up the chain fairly quickly. They train you well, and have a great open door policy."
good,easy job to maintaine as long as your not late or absent for any reason. had bad luck with moving around in the company but overall it treats you better than most.
good,I enjoy working at Lowe's  but I feel that I cannot use all the customer service training that I have at this employer. Lowe's is a good employer I just feel the job is not the right fit for me long term
good,"Part-time employees get health benefits and human resources will work with your schedule if you have a child, school, or another job."
good,Retail sales environment that offers new challanges and never a dull moment.
good,"Overall responsibilities included the direct supervision of six departments within the store (Hardware, Tools, Millwork, Building Materials, Lumber and Commercial Sales).  Ensured that associates  were engaged in achieving their sales budgets for their respective departments on a weekly and monthly basis.  The hardest part of the job were the variable hours that we had to work and the most enjoyable were the daily challenges of the job; assisting customers in fulfilling their project needs and showing them how to achieve it."
good,I returned back to Lowe's after returning from deployment to Iraq with the Ms. Army National Guard.

Responsible for all other duties as assigned."
good,I enjoyed working at Lowe's my other co-workers and the customers made the job all the more worth while.  Lowe's was my actual first jump into customer service I learned the value of treating the customer with the up most respect and in turn I was shown respect.
good,Great place to work but worked many hours. Retail can be hectic sometimes.
good,I was a head cashier at this job. I supervised all the cashiers and scheduled them for daily coverage. My management team was exceptional. They treated everyone with respect. My co-workers are some of the best friends I'll ever have. The worst part about this job was angry customers. They were sometimes quite difficult to deal with.The best part about the job was that I was excited to go to work because the people I worked with were so much like my family.
good,"I loved working at lowes, the management was great, my coworkers were great, and they payed you pretty well as a cashier. They have pretty good benefits if you work up to them."
good,"Loved coming into work, enjoyed being there to help and assist customers in need. Customer Service had a wonderful work environment, I always had the chance for overtime. The people I worked with became close friends, we were a productive team. Management was always there to help. Whenever I needed them, they were just a call away. Hardest part of working for Lowe's was the outside theft. Being at the return desk, this upsets you when people bring in bags of stolen items worth $500-1500. I hated seeing people abuse the system and I would prevent it as much as possible. I really enjoyed working for Lowe's they made you feel needed and an essential part of their team."
good,"Fun place to work, great people to work with. Great with schedule juggiling, and schedules."

good,"i love this job it self, the love driving the machines, label picking, but what i dislike was the heat"
good,"Show up for work and help customers with their purchases all shift long.  I enjoy helping others and learned a great deal about home repairs.  Management that was over me could have used a little more training in management, but for the most part they were supportive.  Worked with many knowledgeable and hard working coworkers.   Loading heavy products out front of the store was probably the most difficult part of this job.  Helping the customer was the most important part of the job."
good,"-Always informed in the morning meeting what kind of day it would be. IE - ""This will be a heavy day for tile, please be careful and take breaks with smaller items"" Or ""Today is a slow day, keep busy with cleaning"""
good,Best company I have worked for. They really care about you and work is easy. Environment is very relaxed but also professional.
good,Lowe's was one of the best jobs that I have ever had. The only downfall is they hire every new employee on as seasonal. Once your seasonal period is over if they have enough people working there already they let you go. You have to have previous employment with Lowe's to be hired on as part-time. Also they tell you that you are doing a great job and that they are going to keep you during your whole seasonal period but once the period ends they don't normally keep you. 
good,"I would just load customers up with any heavy stuff they couldnt lift on their own, my co-workers and management were great, always nice and respectful, "
good,"The typical day is working on the phones to resolve issues with the store employees."
good,I worked for Lowe's corporate office for over three years and loved every single day. 
good,"Worked here for over 10 years.  Was able to advance during the time there.  All employees in our office were great.  Even though Lowe's is a big company this satellite office was like a family."
good,Great place to work and start a career. Great Management teams to work with and learn from. 
good,This is a great place to work it takes a while to move up because positions are limited and no one wants to leave here so there are hardly any spots open.
good,"Unfortunately I was only hired for a seasonal position, but the time I spent there was very rewarding for a number of reasons"
good,"I worked in the lumber section at lowes, and I loved it everyday. I had 1 other associate that worked along side me but we were usally on split shift so I worked by myself most days but would seek some help from other associates in the store while stocking the shelves and driving the forklift since I needed a ground guide while driving the forklift. The management was great and very friendly and so were the customers i delt with. I used to get alot of compliments from customers and I always strived for profection in my section. The hardest part of my job was working alone in my section because I needed ground guides to stock shelves since they were so high up."
good,"Ensuring my customers leave happy. I treat people with respect. Management is very helpful and fun to work with. My co-workers are great and very helpful to work with. The hardest part of the job- is there are very few full-time positions and they do not open up very often. Most enjoyable-is at the end of the day, I can go home feeling I made someone's day happy."
good,Working at Lowes I had a daily job to do. I clock in and hit the register and making sure everything is straighten out before doors are open for customers. I make sure my register is stock with dollars and change and credit card applications. My number one goal at Lowes was to make sure every customers that visits the store leaves wanting to come back. It was my job to provide the greatest customer service I could. 
good,"print the report of all delivery orders that need to be put together for the next days delivery truck."
good,Lowes is a wonderful company that pays well and has good benefits 
good,"I've only been at Lowe's for 6 months now, but I'm convinced I work with the best group of people I've ever worked with. The Team has the ""Whole"" store attitude and they truly have each other's back!! I plan to retire here and know that this is where I wanna be!!"
good,"punch in , print out delivery sheet check what's in stock for delivery go over deliveries with supervisor pull orders call customer with eta, how to work alone manage my time,not very good, some you can count on some you can't, traffic, days off"
good,"Put up displays, maintained stock levels, helped customers.  I learned something every day.  I learned about computers.  "
good,"Lowes is good Co. to work for it has good benefits even as part time.  I got good training in Outdoor Lawen/Garden. In a typical day you would load bag goods[soil,rocks],put away plants&water them and recive trucks of stone,plants,and bag goods. help get any information that people ask you about. for the most part my co-workers are good to work with. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I give someone the information they need to, get thier yard,flower beds,and outher plants looking good and the person comes back and tells me that everthing looks grate because of information I gave them. The management for the most part is good or atlest they give it a good shot."
good,Everyday was fun for me and I miss that work environment. I learned so much from each department. What I learned there was that I could be a do it yourself person with the right tools and basic knowledge skills. 
good,"A significant portion of time is spent in helping customers place custom orders for blinds and window treatments, lots of customer interaction, generally positive interaction with customers. Management seems very helpful when problems arise. The hardest part of the job is dealing with an antiquated computer system which also makes it the worst part."
good,"lowe's was an awesome place to work, the pay was excellent, the people were nice, but the work/ life balance was horrible!"
good,"A typical day of work at Lowe's in the delivery department would be to clock in, Check and make sure all appliances are staged and ready. Once that is done you would load the truck in order of the most efficient route for the delivery day. The manager on duty or the department manager would come and check of the truck, again verifying that all the proper appliances and equitment needed for the deliveries are on the truck. After that was done you would secure the equipment to make sure no damages will occur during the transportation of equipment. Once that was done you would call the customers to verify delivery, address and give them a more specific range of time you expect to make the delivery and the installation of the equiptment. When you arrive at the delivery destination you would knock on the door. Greet the customers in a nice friendly manner and introducing yourself and your partner. Explain again what you are planning on doing step by step and looking at the best possible route for delivery and installation. Once the delivery was done you would walk the customer through about what you did and explain the appliances and equitment used and how to operate the basic functions. After that was finished we would have the customer sign the proper paperwork and always say thank you for the business we appriciate it and have yourself a wonderful day or evening. Always keeping the best possible customer service you can. then it was on to the next delivery to repeat the process all over again. After all the deliveries were done for the day we would head back to the store to the"

good,At customer service i am mainly at my terminal. I am checking out customers or taking phone orders. I also am responsible for making sure internet orders get picked and are ready for the customers when they come in. Customers come to me when they need to pick up an item they may have special ordered previously in the store. They also bring payments to be made on their charge cards. I would say the hardest thing about working customer service is having to be multi-talented. Which i also love because it keeps you on your toes.
good,"It's a very spaced store so there is no feeling cramped up. Many thing to learn such as cutting different materials, differences in products such as paint, flooring, etc. and a diverse assortment of employees. Management is pretty well rounded. They were slow about getting schedules started but it was understandable because having to hire more people because of Spring. The co-workers for the most part are very friendly. There are some who prefer to distance themselves from others. The hardest part of the job is the IMPACT hours where you walk around constantly even if there are no customers. The most enjoyable part of the job to me is learning new things, meeting new people and finding out new ideas for improving houses and such."

The hardest part of my job was trying to get full-time that would work with my school schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help customers with ANY home improvement projects they had."
good,Be a flooring specalist I get to work closely with customer helping them with their remodeling dream. The hardest part of my job is having a unsatisfied customer.

There are many multitasks being handled on a day to day basis. Between customers, the phone and paperwork there is so much to be done. I enjoy all of the daily challenges."
good,"Just to clarify, I didn't work for Lowes I just worked in their warehouse. A typical day at work started with letting someone know I was in the building then getting the product moved from the back to the floor of the warehouse. I would then proceed to remove the moulding from the stack and put it in it's respective places on the shelf. I learned to be a self starter, a motivator and fast paced worker. I was the only worker on the jobs I did so it worked well. Since I didn't own a car the hardest part of the job was traveling to different Lowes as I eventually worked at four Lowes in Delaware and two Lowes in South New Jersey. The most enjoyable part of the job was the sense of accomplishment. Yes, in my opinion a job well done when I got the paperwork signed at the end of each job considering the workload: 3000lbs-6000lbs per load."

This job doesn't pay super great but I still find it to be a great job for someone that is semi retired and winding down their working years. The training is good and environment is excellent, the majority of customers are very loyal to Lowes and appreciate the great customer service that Lowes demands of all the associates."
good,"Lowe's was a great place to work with potential for advancement within the company. Working the Customer Service counter at Lowe's provided me with many valuable lessons in conflict resolution and customer care. The hardest part of the job, like any in retail, was the unsteady hours i.e. working days/nights/weekends. The best part was working with the public; getting to know loyal customers and meeting new characters every day."
good,"Arriving on time everyday to satisfy the customers.Since I have been at Lowes i have learned to process orders for customers,and make sure delivery is delivered on time.Management was very helpful to me when ever I was n need.My co-workers worked together when ever there was the need to.They are very polite and didnt mind helping each other.There was no hard part of the day Lowes was a fun place to work and I really enjoyed making the customers happy."

good,"On a typical day I run reports and work them to company policy. I also multipule phone call to handle any customer issues dealing with credit, payments, invoices, tax corrections/status, and unauthorize purchases by employers of different companie. Daily I have to enter inventory stock of sold items to have them reordered or if nonstock, to take them out of inventory. In addition to that I call vendors to see about getting credit of margin losses on special order returned merchandise. Management could be improved. My co-workers are all different. Some take there job serious and do what needs to be done and others are a different store. There are really no hard parts of my job. It's just a task to get everyone to follow policy to make things go as a even flow. The most enjoyable part of my job are the customer's. i am a people person and love the customer service of interacting with everyone."

At the one I work for, everyone from management to my co-workers are all a joy to work with and are willing to help the customer in any way we can. The hardest part of the job is that the hours you work changes every day and one may have to close on night and open the next day. I was a cashier so I was trained how to use their programs."
good,"Lowe's has everything an employee would want for their career. A challenging environment with resources to help you make the most of your potential. You are only restricted by your self. Great benefits, and strong employee/customer based values."

good,If you're a college student in need of work or just looking to make extra cash this job offers a great work environment. Lowe's is a good place to be at.
good,"Depending on the day, it could be very busy or slow. While working as a cashier, I would have to work with both happy and angry customers, and try to handle them in the best way possible. This would include having conversations and fixing problems. The management was always reliable and would step in if you needed support. Fellow employees were very friendly and easy to get along with. The training process was gradual and helped you slowly but surely conform into the job culture. When I finally got my red vest, I was nervous still but felt accomplished and provided the training to do my job effectively. If you are searching for jobs, I would suggest making this one of your first applications. Very high quality job!"

The company as a whole values you and acknowledges your accomplishments. The pay is competitive to other retailers. They also value are veterans if its associate or customer. From day one we are trained to thank them for there services. On a whole I say it is a excellent place to work
good,Probably the best job I’ve ever worked at. Good company to work at. The only thing I have to complain is not enough hours. You have to work as a temp first then going to part time then to full time.
good,My review of Lowe's is right on.  The only reason I did not go back...too many emotions involved.  Worked there during the families' illness and their deaths.
good,"Lowe’s is a good company to work for. They expect you to do your job well and be dependable. If you can do that, you can move up quickly with the company."

good,They always made sure they gave us everything that we needed and gave back to us and they made sure that your check was right and made sure everyone had benefits and everything like it
good,I've worked for multiple retailers and there has only 2 that I have felt little to no stress at and that is Sam's club(before they closed) and Now Lowes.  Everyone that I work with tries to help me succeed and the work schedule is great.
good,I love my job!  It’s a customer centric atmosphere. Benefits are outstanding. The job is very rewarding and the people I work with are wonderful. The community outreach that this company dedicates is inspiring.
good,I love this place it's great they treat you well pay is good benefits also  and you get to have your own desk here witch may not seem like much but no sharing is sweet
good,Basically gotta always keep a positive attitude no matter what. When you see someone smile it makes you smile literally. It’s not about you it’s about the well being of the customers
good,"It was a cool loving place very friendly environment, learn new things and make new friends with employees or customers. Helping customers had up and down moments but working with a good team and store days feel good."

good,"A relaxed workplace, enjoy everyone I work with. Productive, High security which makes you feel safe. A campus environment. Onsite cafeterias. Clean and just a wonderful overall environment."
good,I work in the home decor department . Blinds can get frustrating when they don't work properly . Customers can get irritated quickly when they don't have the right product . Installers always measure incorrectly so the customers blame you but I'm really quick with problem solving so I've learned the tricks with the vendors . I know everything there is to know about shades and blinds. Associates are great everyone gets along . Mangers are okay some greater than others . Enjoyable part would be that managers do not tell me anything because I am always working .
good,"Lowe's truly believes in and practices a team culture, team members were always willing to help when needed, even if they were from another department."
good,"I was a part of the Merchandising Service Team (MST). We didn't really work with customers, we were more behind the scenes. We had many different projects but stocking and organizing was the main job. It was a lot of fun for me. My boss that worked with the team was always very hard working and always treated us as the leader, never someone who just demanded things and sat down to watch everything happened. My team was the best team I've ever had. Never seen a group of people work that well together in my life, and I played basketball in high school."
good,"Job training is available for only the job you do, but other jobs at Lowes that you might want to try later. Time is provided for this training, too. It is reasonably easy to move from one department to the other if you've taken the training and qualify for the job. I've seen fairly young people do jobs, that in the past, were reserved for older people. "
good,"Great company to work. Work-life balance and lots of training and opportunities to grow.Management us very supportive .   "
good,"I Love working at Lowe's, Great Team players in Erwin Store. Our Manager is the Best and so are all our ASM's  just a bunch of good people which make up our store."

good,I liked working at Lowe's because there was always something to do and most of the time there was always somebody to help you get the job done. Whether it be supervising forklift operations or simply putting up sales signs during the night shift. Lowe's always has an asssignment for the employee to complete and gives you ample amount of help to complete said assignment
good,As management we must not abuse our authority and it is our duty to help those wanting to further their career with any company so that they do not feel stagnant.
good,"I worked at Lowe's different positions different stores "
good,At the time I lived in South Carolina. But somethings didn’t work out so I had to move away about the company Tried to transfer me to a store in Michigan but I was told that all the positions were filled. But as a company As a whole it is a great company to work for!

good,"Over the last 7 years, Lowe's has grown to be another home for me. From the first day every associate and manager makes you feel welcome, and eventually they just feel like family."
good,"It’s a good place to work, Brent here for a year and they give great benefits but for a variety of jobs. They pay isn’t terrible starting out but it also varies thought out the store."
good,I loved working at lowes! You would get off a weekend once a month and almost always had 2 days off in a row during the weeks you worked the weekend. Great discounts and great managers.

good,"Never bored, never the same day twice"
good,"Great environment, learn different areas of the store. Gain knowledge through products and even through customers. Learned to manage time whether fast and careful pace."

good,"The job isn't always easy but when you see a customers face light up with happiness or a little boy excited about how the paint machine works, that makes up for all the bad. We truly help people love where they live and it makes me love my job."
good,Great place to work if your a people’s person. Constant interaction with customers and associates day in and day out. Very friendly work environment and faces
good,Great company but it the management doesn't like to communicate with there employees other than that not all manager are dishonest to each other. I hope ceo(vice presedent) will do better with his company that he is lksing alot of good employees who put in years with this company
good,"Great company that values employees. Customer service is priority. Safety always!  Retail work hours include holidays, weekends, early hours and night hours. Schedules change regularly."
good,I learned a lot about how to work retail work. Learned how to work with customers in every way. Learned a lot about the items there and what they are all used for. All together a great place to work for.

good,Loved my fellow associates and the environment. Definitely pushed me to step out of my comfort zone and challenge myself and grow as a person and supervisor every day.
good,"Great place to work, typical Corporate environment, great opportunity to advance with the company if there is interest, just pursue the intra-company training and have the ability to travel.  As a single-parent, I didn't have that opportunity to while employed with Lowe's; although now I have that ability and would like to get back in with the company."
good,"Working for Lowe's was an eye opener expirience and the best way to get back to what I love to do the most which is s design, sales and people!!!!  I had a base paid but also the opportunity to have commission which had no limit on how much I could do. As an project Interior Specialist I could work from home sometmes as well as in the store but most of the time I spend on in-home"
good,This job could’ve been the best I ever had but the salary was not good enough especially for a person of experience. I worked at Home Depot before I came to Lowe’s but didn’t match what Home Depot paid.
good,"I had to work very hard and fast to perform my job to the best of my abilities. And try not to make mistakes, and to be ready for anything. Cause alot can change through out the day."
good,It was a calm paced environment . Required a lot of patients hard work and dedication. Required a lot of one on one time and interacting wit the customers. Required the workers to learn and love the department which they were working on
good,Overall it was a fun and relaxing work environment i make friend that i still communicate with today. and there was always room to learn more and grow.
good,I truly do like the job. I quit and come back the pay is good. You get good vacation and benifit packages! And not to mention you can't beat the fact that you work in a wear house and its not 900° inside
good,It was an easy job over all except when I finished every thing. We were required to sign in and out our schedules were emailed to us. Hardest part of the job was when I had nothing to do. The most enjoyable part of the job was restocking plants. I learned how to work in a fast paced environment while marathoning good costomer service to costomers
good,I loved working there and if there would have been an opening for full time and advancement I probably would have stayed. I would love to return if they ever had a full time position open. The store manager is so nice and won’t ask you to do anything he won’t do himself. I’m the same way so I greatly appreciate that in a manager.
good,In each position I worked at Lowe's since 2012. The work hours I could never complain about. My availability was opened. A typical work day at Lowe's was customer service. Customer service was the key in all departments through out the store. Management was there to assist you with any questions or concerns you had.
good,I loved working for lowes in Tulsa when I moved to Enid it wasn't the same and I don't recommend the Enid location.  The company over all is an amazing company to work for.
good,"If you're into working retail not a bad place to work but some times retail can be overwhelming. Training is always available, friendly atmosphere. Very easy to learn other skills as far as other departments which creates avenues for advancement."

good,Always had something to do never had a slow point in the day being an assembler. Completing guest and online orders to be picked up and delivered. Friendly work environment and crew.
good,"Arrive, clock in, complete safety checklist, check emails for additional tasks or information. Complete tasks given by management as well as assist customers. I learned good service skills, sales jargon, product knowledge, lock re-key and installation. The hardest part is the monotony of the everyday grind. Co-workers treat you like family, its a good place to work."
good,A great  work environment with the opportunity for growth and promotion within the company. great benefits and incentives to motivate employees and drive sales.
good,Working for Lowe's was a great opportunity that I am glad that I had been able to work for. The coworkers were very nice and the company is flexible and enjoyable to work for.
good,"Only been here for a short time but seem like that a very nice place to work , great pay great people , there also a gym at the headquarters plus great food ."
good,Lowe's is a great company to work for. Benefits and pay are good also. Management at the location I work at for the most part is good. Overall it's a good company to work for.
good,I really enjoy this company! I was supported through each roll by amazing leaders going out of their way to invest in me. Great management very positive environment with great benefits and room to grow.
good,"I offloaded trucks and placed merchandise in appropriate locations for sale. Assisted customers with loading heavier items into their vehicles. Learned a lot about customer service. The management is very fair and willing to listen to your needs. The culture of Lowe's is that of a great place to work! Employee's are happy to be there!! Hardest part of job was dealing with the natural elements - those storage trailers get HOT! Best part of the work day was helping customers, especially the Veterans and the elderly."
good,"Es un trabajo con excelente hambiente laboral ,oportunidad  de crecimiento/prestaciones."
good,Really good job for someone with good joints starting out in retail. Can be stressful when really busy but overall pretty relaxed. Great pay and great people.
good,Lowes is a great place to work. Customer friendly new skills being taught each and every day. Before I started working at Lowes I didn't have any experience on the power equipment that they have. Now in certified on all three different machines. By me being the ltl of the store I have really have to be power equipment certified. A typical morning for me would be making sure the dock is clear so we can have room to unload trucks. Once that is done I go outside to make sure if there is a truck needed unloaded. Once unloaded scan and receive product.
good,"I think its a good company. Not many perks except 10% off purchases (doesn't cover even tax). Good management, understanding coworkers willing to help."
good,Good job but you will be tired at the end of the day. Fast pace on production. Hot in the summer and not too cold in the winter besides your working loading pallets to notice. The only complaint I have is management and the coaches need to communicate better and update equipment. Forklifts especially the elf's need improvement. But you get your picks in the morning and as long as you so your job no one bothers you and that's the one thing I really like.
good,I like photo and people are beautiful design house I like a travel all over place stop by friendship and hobby wood. Rebuild repaired and garden plant and tree.
good,Being knowledgeable about your area is definitely needed. Customer service is the everyday from resolving issues through phone calls to working with customers on the floor.
good,"Muy buenas prestaciones, excelente ambiente laboral, cultura de trabajo excelente"
good,I've been here a little over a year and had 3 promotions in that time. Put in the work and the job will take care of you. Great family was vibe from the top to the bottom
good,I worked there for a couple years. It is always moving product and changes with seasons. The management is fair and hard working. The customers were fun.
good,"Great job, friendly people. Everyone helps each other out and if you don't know something there is always some one around who can answer your questions"
good,It is physical work working at Lowes but I learned a lot of quality life skills from my time there that I can take with me for the rest of my life. A good workout too.
good,"A typical workday for me started with doing an inspection of my forklift and turning it in to my coach(manager), they would then give me my assigned area for the day and i would go there and put pallets in their locations. Since i drove the Reach forklift specifically i put pallets away in the permanent steel racks that are in the warehouse, so i had to be very careful and watch how i was moving and where the pallet was placed. In my short period here i have learned that safety is everyone's responsibility. Management at Lowe's is very much involved with the team members they are easy to talk with and any time there is an incident or a problem the open door policy makes it easy to report the problem. The culture of the job is relaxed however its also competitive, so even though throughout the day things are very fast paced its still relaxing and easy going. The hardest part of my job is when i would have to put a pallet away on the top shelf of the permanent steel racks because that's about forty feet up and its a little difficult to see sometimes, but the easiest part of the job is driving the equipment and replacing pallets in the mod area, which is where the pallet gets unloaded for shipping to the store immediately."
good,Fun fast pase customers we good it was slow sometime   had.       Fun.        Just wasn't the typw for me.     Just not enough pay.  For a vehicle for myself
good,Lowes was a great place to work and I learned a lot from the people I worked with while I was there. There are going to be people you may not like to work with but Lowes management usually does a good job of trying to place you somewhere within the store that will make you happy.
good,"I absolutely loved working for Lowe's. It was easy work. The bosses were fantastic, and very willing to help you out. They have a good clean store. A good reputation. Customers generally know what they want, or want to accomplish when they come to the store. You do occasionally run into the jerk customer, but i found it to be very rare during my time working there. You are generally asked to do jobs within the scope of your job description and are not required to go outside of that scope."
good,"Go thru security, clock in, go to machinery, complete an equipment calibration then go to designated area and start receiving. I've learned how to operate and got my certification on a stand up fork lift. I learned how to operate a pallet rider. I enjoy the inner personal skills and utilizing the computer skills or computer management."
good,"I was a WE-Team member, so I worked mostly weekends. It was strictly customer-service oriented. It allowed me to travel to different departments and learn lots of useful skills!"
good,"I am treated as an important member of the team and am regularly asked for my input to help make my job more efficient.  The culture is one that instills teamwork which brings out the best in me.  It has been a great place to grow and learn new skills.  Moving from a customer service focused department, paint, to a more skills building department, receiving has given me more confidence in myself."
good,Other than being outside in the 80  other than being in 80° heat  It was a relaxing job all I had to do is water the flower make sure the  customers got what they wanted when they came in
good,"This place is amazing, they care so much about the employee, I have never been a part of a company like this. The training is great, the management is amazing and it's a good schedule with OT almost always available."
good,Very professional and a lots of experience to gain working with Lowe's. It teach me how to treat and respect other people. the working environment is very diverse and multi culture environment.
good,This is a great place for a college student to work while they are going to school to earn some money. Very friendly workers who are willing to help you learn.
good,"Loved my time at lowes.  I started off as a morning stocker while going to nursing school.  Lowes kept promoting me, from stocker, to WE team, to specialist to Dept Manager.  I went to part time to be a nurse full time, so I was a head cashier.  I loved every position at Lowes. "
good,"I appreciate the effort the managers put in to give me proper training while moving up the scale as to becoming a  specialist."
good,Management was extremely well to work with. They treated everyone great and was very easy to get along with and they definitely worked with you on your availability
good,"Beaucoup de soutient, esprit d'équipe, respectueux conciliation famille travail."
good,Everyone is very friendly and will do their best to help train and assist you however you need. It is a fast paced job but you get breaks every two hours and the work load isn't unbearable.
good,I loved working for Lowes. I was appreciated everyday by any one employed there. They made me feel like family from my first day there to my last. Everyone was helpful and never made you feel like you were asking dumb questions.
good,"New leadership is making practical, smart moves to improve their place in the ecommerce realm.  While there is a but of unrest due to change in the executive team, I strongly feel that they are headed in the right direction.  I would have stayed had my job been available anywhere other than North Carolina."
good,We had meetings for the whole store and they provided breakfast.  There were also department meetings where they had snacks.  Water was provided for those working in garden area.  I feel that some days are really busy and others are more laid back.
good,Everyone is awesome the are fun to be around they are cool awesome and they will help you with anything you need help with the people are cool and fun to work with
good,"It was fun, energetic , and always something to do . It was never boring. I loved the experience I got while working for Lowes. It was an learning experience because it gave me insight on a lot of construction material."
good,"I worked for Lowes as a Loss Prevention Specialist for about 2 years. Unfortunately the loss prevention underwent a restructure and the position is no longer in place (which is why that was not 5 stars) but they do have great advancement opportunities. Having worked in retail loss prevention for almost 16 years before coming to Lowes, I thought that I knew everything, but I found out that I didn't know as much as I thought that I did after my first week. My LPSM and LPOSM were very knowledgeable and helpful and guided me every step of the way and gave me the tools I needed to succeed. The company cares about it's associates and treats you like family. The training is very competitive and hands on and in depth. You are given many recourses to gather information from, thus making your job a lot more easier. They have many team building exercises that they do quarterly, along with cookouts, and community events (never a dull moment) The pay is above industry standards, and you have vacation days from day 1! I truly can not say enough good things about this company. Wish I was still there. I miss my Lowes family."
good,"Starting everyday with a team meeting, showed it was a team effort from the minute those doors opened.  Everyone working together to make sure that every customer that comes through the door is helped with anything, and everything they had questions, or need help with.  Every person in that building had one goal, Help whoever needs help."
good,Fun to work at. Great benefits and the managers are good to respond to and whatever you would need help wit. Also work place is fast and constantly moving.
good,Professional and clean environment offering many different types of employment from management and sales to delivery and janitorial.  A little bit for every employee.
good,"Always fun to see customers come in and see what projects they are working on and see the start to finished project. As a cashier it was always a plus to know the store and where to find merchandise, It is also a plus to know what goes into each project to make sure the customer has everything to complete the project,"
good,"I loved working here, my mom works here now I used to work with her . Everyone here is super nice and they love me because they love my mom, she worked in plumbing and I worked as a cashier ."
good,it depends on what department you work so u can’t judge how busy your day is going to be but during the week its slow but Saturday and Sunday are the busiest. Everybody gets along with everyone.
good,Was a very good 1st time job. I learned alot about home improvement. I always asked to get over time . it was hot in the summer time when you had to work in the Garden center.
good,"I liked working at Lowes, it was fun and many great people to work with. A new challenge everyday and was busy all day everyday.."
good,"Lowes was a great place to work the people and over feeling of being a part of a team that worked together was great, everyone felt respected, but then they hired a new manager and all that changed, it went from being a great place to where we were always being watched and they start laying off good people because they were not fast enough, mine you that some of the works were 50 plus years old, these made the whole team start to sink. And the team slowly but surly found other places of employment"
good,"Worked as a Temp for almost 4 months.  Helped them moved department to Mooresville."
good,"Over the last several years, Lowe's has truly become a company of servant leadership. this has translated into serving our customers and communities. The customer is at the heart of what we do."
good,It was a fun experience but not really for me the work is easy and they provide a nice way to give you a career of a lifetime I honestly thought I would stay longer.
good,Lowe's helped me find my path in life in some ways as it allowed myself to show my good work ethic and how dedicated i was to completing the job and making sure it was done right while also taking the necessary safety precautions to ensure that everyone i worked with did not get injured in any way. Lowe's taught me many things about the world of construction and has definitely influenced me to want to dive further into different branches to better my knowledge and skill in the study of trades.
good,Love my job. Love working with the public. Was a team player. At the time I work there it was a good working place to work. I also help put the shelf together and stock the store before they first open. So you can say that that I was there at the beginning.
good,great place to work. has overtime available. mandatory overtime on busy days. No work on Thanksgiving and Christmas. Provides 10% discount for employees
good,I worked at Lowe's for 15 years now it was always managed very well they make a lot of changes some are some are bad over all the people I work with are great
good,"Love Lowes company and love the people I work with."
good,Very flexible and compensation is based in experience. You are able to pick up a lot more shifts if you are trained in other departments. The managers are great to work with and for.
good,"It can be fast-paced, overall nothing too exhausting. Great environment, management communicates well with employees. Plenty of advancement with hard work."
good,A great place to work I would of stayed but my store closed. After I was transferred I did not like the atmosphere of the new store and the attitude of the store manager.
good,It is a very good place to work it is also a good place to learn new skills you are able to move around in different departments and learn new things they have good benefits they have good management they do a lot of different things for their employees to boost the morale open door policy
good,"great place to work, great management, fun work environment, management cares about you and your family life and goes to extra lengths to ensure your work/life balance is where you want it."
good,Overall working for Lowes was a wonderful experience despite working a demanding job they were very accommodating to my needs as an employee and were also very flexible in hours

good,"Company offers training, opportunity for advancement, management support, and decent benefits. Customer focus is emphasized and the work environment is healthy."
good,I loved being part of Lowe's Family. Very good management and friendly environment. Gave me job satisfaction and also developed my managerial and people skills.
good,"Company works with employees to help maintain work/life balance.  Benefits include medical, maternity/paternity leave, dental, vision, short/long term disability, stocks, 401k matches, and several others."
good,"Each day brought a new set of challenges and opportunities.  As a manager of a dedicated staff, I was able to draw the best out of my employees. I found the job to be very rewarding."
good,"I loved working for Lowe's and the teams I was involved with in all the positions I held. I was treated with respect always."
good,The best job - the best coworkers - the best supervisor - the best team work for the common goal - would work there again in a heart beat.  The only reason I had to leave was the due to the distance I lived from the job location.
good,I have enjoyed working for Lowes.  They have alot of benefits to offer.  I have been with Lowes for the past 23 years.  I have made alot of friendships.
good,Lowe's has a family environment. There is plenty of opportunity to advance in the company and you feel like a valued asset within the team. Would recommend to anyone.
good,"Excelente ambiente laboral"
good,"I have worked at Lowe's for over 9 years and moved up in positions from cashier to now, Flooring Sales Specialist. Lowe's is a place to exchange ideas and work with great people."
good,"everyone there is amazing and very nice, highly recommend going here for work to get experience and to possibly make a very rewarding career out of it"
good,"Always had fun, always had challenges here, always had to solve issues as well, would recommend lowes to anyone who is willing to work hard and fast ."
good,"I loved working with my Lowe's family in a fast-paced, customer oriented environment. I am still slightly perplexed that some people are moved into higher positions with more responsibility based solely on who they know or how they answer a couple of computer generated questions. I learned that in order to be a good manager you must get to know your people and their abilities. The hardest part of the job is having people in positions who either don't know how to do the job or just don't care about providing good customer service."
good,I had a schedule that rotated days off with one evening shift per week. Management cares about their people and held motivational meetings every morning with the opening crew. Everyone in the store is willing to lend a helping hand when needed.
good,"All employees and management are very friendly, easy going, and hard working. Employment at Lowes consists of many different job functions.I can take with me that I learned more on how to multi task as well as manage priorities. Management was reasonable but I felt like the management to employee ratio was very unbalanced. There wasnt really a hard part to the job except using the lift if youre afraid of heights. The most enjoyable part of the job was the different things that Lowes did fir the community."
good,"If you have a work ethic, get along great with people, and show up to work on time, this place is for you. Have a good attitude, and explore hardware knowledge, you'll do just fine."
good,Working in the install office as a coordinator has been great. It does give a challenging workplace that makes each day different. The management is great for the most part a few bad managers but that will be the same anywhere. As long as you go to work and actually do your job it's a great place to work.
good,Great Company to work for. Great benefits & 401 plan. They are flexible with there employees. They treat there employees very kind & respectful. I highly recommend this company
good,"I started as a seasonal employee and was asked to stay on after the season. I enjoy the people that i work with, i really like that they are a dog friendly store."
good,"The saw great potential in me, they complimented me and promoted me. Regard my feed back;  treat me with respect me. Talk to not at me.lowes overall care about me"
good,"I’ve worked at Lowe’s for almost a year now and couldn’t be happier. I started as a seasonal employee and have moved up to working part time at customer service. I have learned that if you keep a thick skin towards some of the more aggressive or crude customers, managers will do a great job of taking care of the associates and customers."
good,"Days varied as to which role you would play each day provided you had the necessary training. It was never unpleasant but rather ""fun"" to work among your colleagues. I learned a lot about handling cash and operating a cash register. The management in the store was great and always backed you up. The culture in the workplace was always positive and Lowe's strived to make sure of that with different events for the employees. The hardest part of the job was having a customer leave unhappy and unsatisfied. The best part of the job was working around people that I cared about and also ensuring that every customer who left the store went home with exactly what they wanted."
good,I enjoyed working with co workers we all had the same in common to make work and shopping for customers a enjoyable place to be I've learned to be very patient and slow to anger and to handle a situation to the best of my ability
good,"Research,gather,release order "
good,I loved it they seemed to try to advance from within if possible and care about the safety and happiness of there employee's. I started as a seasonal lawn and garden associate and within 90 days I became part-time then about 10 months later became full-time and got a significant raise and benefits I never dreamed of with my qualifications. they were always fair to me and I continue to recommend them to anyone.
good,"Most of the employees are great to work with, some are more knowledgeable than others. Listening and even asking questions is encouraged. Enriched learning environment."
good,The store I work is pretty developed and organized it’s easy to find where things are and the people I work with are very helpful making m job much easier and less of a hassle.
good,"Very welcomed as new employee or customer. They treat nice and fair. Always explained instructions and always cared about safety. It’s important to know every employee around your areas, even if you only seen them rarely."
good,"Working at Lowes has been an opportunity to learn new job skills and to work with the general public. Coming from insurance where I worked with insurance professionals, working with the public was an unexpected opportunity to develope new skills outside of my comfort zone. From advice on plumbing to suggesting the best landscape plants, each day is an opportunity to learn something new."
good,"They more than minimum wage, they have a very relaxed dress code. The company is really customer based, so be prepared to consistently interact with customers everyday."
good,I enjoyed the fast-paced work environment at Lowe's Home Improvement. I truly loved serving the diverse customer base. The hardest part of the job was feeling as though my pursuit of excellence in performing my duties made both my peers and management uncomfortable.
good,I really like working for lowe's.. They treat you fair and well.... The associates are fun to work with. Its like a family.. It can be just like any where else I guess good days and bad but retail is like that. Overall customers are nice and its fun to work with them....
good,"Enjoyed working for Lowe's. A typical day was to make sure merchandise was set and in the appropriate atmosphere.Management was team orientated. The hardest part of the job was time went by so fast that breaks were sometimes not even thought of happening. I enjoyed that time went by fast,and you keep busy."
good,"Working at Lowes was a wonderful experience.  Not only were the benefits great, they have a good 401k company match program.  I often regret leaving the company after 10 years."
good,I enjoyed my time at Lowe's. I ran afoul a safety policy that brought about my untimely dismissal or I would still be there today.  Great people to work with.
good,Best job I ever had.. meeting new people everyday. Have a great morning meeting to get your day started. If you love meeting and helping new people you will love working at Lowe’s.
good,I really enjoy working at Lowes but at this stage in my life I need full time employment. The management is approachable. For the most part Lowes is a great to work
good,"I don't really have any standout experiences while working at Lowe's. Some days were pleasant others not so much, after working in the seasonal department for about 3 months I transferred to Recievng."
good,pleasantly surprised at good working atmosphere. I was trained on all equipment at work immediately. It was a very stress free work place and management was easy to work with.
good,When I worked at Lowe’s it was always fun and everyday I learned something new. I worked with people I know and met so many great people that worked there before me. The veterans of Lowe’s were always outgoing and didn’t mind helping you if you didn’t know something & they always said to not be scared to ask if you need help because it was all about working together to get things right and satisfying our customers.
good,I met so many great people here and loved everyone I had the pleasure of working with. I enjoyed being able to help and encourage customers with home improvement.

good,"Took customer's plans and designed kitchens and baths. Helped customers select cabinet types and plumbing fixtures as well. While there I sold almost two million dollars worth of cabinets, special order and off the shelf."
good,"Good place to work, probably the best job I’ve ever had. You can also learn new skills. Every one of my coworkers always talked about another advancement they’ve made in the company so there’s definitely room to grow."
good,"i love the fact that i was able to help the customer(s) an put a smile on their face before they left with or without their merchinedise.especially helping the elderly customer(s),they appreciate you more"
good,"Good company to work for. Pay is outstanding, but so is the demand for your time. Set schedules where you get a weekend off every other weekend, and there's a set rotation for the entire year. easy to plan time off."
good,"I was in receiving so I unloaded the shipment trucks when they got there. We would set pallets out for each type of items we got and we would sit the item on the pallet it needs to go on. For example, if we had a push mower in a box, we would sit that on the lawn and garden pallet or if there was a box of pvc pipe for sinks, it would go in plumping. Management were all very friendly and helpful with any questions I ever had and made a schedule that was good for my busy school schedule. The hardest part was lifting some of the bigger items out of the truck, even with help. The most enjoyable part was working with the 3 guys I worked with in the back. We all became good friends very quickly, never complained about each other and helped each other out whenever someone needed it."
good,"Very good company to work for, I couldn’t say enough good about this company, they treat you like family, most of all they care about you. I love the people I work with and I have a few great managers. The opportunity to move up is great, the starting pay is good it’s just hard to get much of a raise every year. I work hard and never miss work."
good,"Great place to work, fast paced. Hard to advance until someone leaves or retires. Very hard to get full time employment. Their business model now is to hire mostly part time. would rather hire 2 part time people then one full time"
good,"Emptying trailers and cleaning them, loading and unloading pallets,breaking down boxes,sweeping the warehouse.putting skids into their designated places"
good,I spent 8 years in the Home Improvement industry and I enjoyed working at Lowe's for two of those years. In Nevada and California I really appreciated the companies' structure.
good,"I worked in several Departments and learned a whole lot with the company, rewarding and had I stayed in WISC and not moved back to Fla, I still would have been there."
good,Learned a lot and was able to live off of the money made during my employment. The management and training staff were awesome and very professional. Would recommend to work there.
good,"customer service, product knowledge, inventory, busy during weekends and holidays as well as special sales dates. management is awesome they are very kind and give you as much help needed to complete a task at work."
good,"Good place to work.  Hours could sometimes be long.  However,  they do allow and expect you to manage like its your store. Good structure and training programs."
good,"Providing services to customers daily; ringing sales, directing customers to departments needed; requesting assistance for customers. Cleaning and stocking.  A great place to work"

good,"Manage people in the department.  Serve as Manager On Duty.  Handle and solve customer complaints.  Work Non product inventory report.  Work Cycle Counts for Inventory. Count down safe at night to match days sales.  Review and make schedules for my zone.  Enjoyable part of my job is working with my team thru teamwork and promoting teamwork.  Helping them out in the dept when needed when customer flow increases.  Hardest part of my job is trying to please every customer that comes into the store, but that is not possible.  Love working with the public at Lowes and helping people Love where they live."

good,Good job everyone who is looking for work this is a good place to work great people great staff great managers always on top of things the atmosphere is wonderful
good,A typical day at Lowe's involves you helping customers get what they need. Making sure that the areas around you are properly stocked and labeled. I work in the Kitchen Cabinet Department so I spend most of my time helping customers design kitchens or bathrooms. The management there is very helpful and very informative with daily information for store processes. The hardest part of the job is being able to find the help you need in departments that are short handed all the time.
good,People were great. Enviroment was friendly. there was a lot of room for advancement. Management was fantastic (Made you feel at home). Hardest part of job was doing the same thing day in day out.

good,Overall this was my favorite company and wish I had stayed. People I worked with were tremendous and I became friends with many of my peers. Job was challenging but one needs big box retail experience to thrive.
good,"I got to say, working at Lowes is a fun experience. I learn so many stuff about how the store operates. I work from 8 am to 2 pm 5 days a week. I'm a customer service at garden centre. My responsibilities include watering plants, provide knowledge about the plants, and customer service. Hardest part is to memorize over 500 species of plants and their function. The best part is coworkers. They are fun and enjoyable. I even have a fun time with my Assistant Store Manager."

Our culture was amazing because it was all about family, I learned how to be patient with our customers because that are the ones that are important to our great customer service we offered. Management was great. The hardest part of my day was when coworkers call out."
good,"Your mostly answering customers questions and helping load materiel, Most stocking is done with a forklift and loading, You take and pull orders when they come in, Sweep the department, put up returns and flats stack lumber when closing."
good,Good place to work - Lot's of transition right no. It all looks positive though. The only reason I would really leave is because I need something closer to home.
good,"Personally,  Lowe's was my favorite job to date. My Co-workers were pleasant to work with, management was very fair & my hours & pay were flexible & fair."
good,"I'm a seasonal employee hoping to become permanent. Even if I don't get that, it's been a great place to work. Great co-workers, great managers, and a great store manager. The ours are all over the place, though, as is any job in retail. But I expected that going in. The starting pay was much higher than I expected and I know there will be a raise if I get kept as a permanent employee. They're great about putting you in departments that you prefer when they can."
good,I worked hard each and every day to help make the company more productive and safe no matter what came to happen i will always have a strong love for the lowes family
good,South San Jose 1756 Employees are great  they get the job from commercial sales and lumber to outside garden customer service is awesome and willing to help every customer.
good,I met some amazing people there. I enjoyed learning a lot of about different departments. They provided a lot of good training courses and its all paid training. I loved the work I did there but needed something full time.

The hardest thing about the job was climbing the ladder several times a day to down stock merchandise. I enjoyed meeting new people and helping them find what they need."
good,Great place for seasonal work for ongoing college students. Managment are willing to work around your schedule and provide good training. Downside is seasonal positions are terminated at any time and are not consistent year by year. If the summer proves slow that year there will be lay offs
good,I loved my job but had to relocate back to California. I had some great co-workers and amazing supervisors. I worked at the Pasco store in Washington before having to leave.

good,"I started as an hourly associate in the cash office and worked myself into a District installation manager.  I had 25 stores, and 200 installers that I was in charge of."
good,"They try hard to work with you when life throws curve balls at you. You do need to be a bit flexible."
good,"Cashiering had a lot of ""down"" time..inbetween-customer-time. Therefore, we had daily front end assignments of washing windows, dusting, stocking the wrap arounds at each check out and quizzes to take on a lap top. The position at Lowe's as a cashier taught integrity, loyalty, and most of all, how to be a sleuth.  We were schooled in how to spot shop lifters and what to do with them, which was: give them the BEST customer service!  We were taught what our options were and were NOT!  That was probably the hardest part of the postion. The management team was for the most part excellent.  As with any place of employment, there will always be that ONE manager who shines differently than all the rest. Some were fair and some not so much, but putting it in perspective? It was the best at that time and cause. The most enjoyable part of working at Lowe's was going over and above our sales for the day!  THAT made everything worth the time spent in that day!"
good,My experience at Lowes was fun and exciting.  The change of seasons rearranged the whole store. I learned alot while there.  Everyone was friendly and helpful.

good,Having a great experience so far! Have had consistent pay and a great relationship with coworkers and management! Online working weekends currently and intend to stay for some time
good,"Typical days consist of keeping merchandise on shelves presentable, promoting merchandise in your department and being available to assist customers. you will learn retail and customer service skills as well as familiarity with various home improvement goods. Management is helpful and will groom you to advance. The culture is productive and friendly."
good,The only reason I left was I was offered a job that was paying over double what I was currently making. I was fresh out of college so it was a big jump for me. I would love to go back but I would need to make more to support my family.
good,"Glad I had the opportunity to interview and be hired on as a seasonal employee. I'm developing skills that will help me in future employment endeavors,"

good,"Nice place to work at. Good breaks. 15 min. 2 lunches"
good,"Lowe’s had made several changes in the last few years, some are better than others but all are designed to keep the company relevant and customer focused. I applied for a part time temporary job 4 years ago and have advanced to a leadership role very quickly. We work hard and it’s not always fun but we get to help people love where they live. All it takes to be successful is the right attitude. I honestly feel there are no limits to how high I can reach in this company. My manager’s goal is to help each of us to reach ours. My store has little turn around and fairly high engagement."
good,"I worked on putting merchandise in the places they were suppose to go, not only did I get paid well doing it but I also made friends and had fun everyday I came to work. I was exhausted every day after work but I was happy and felt accomplished"

Managers were great and very helpful when I had problems. The workplace and employees were more like a family than coworkers.
good,"It was always productive , always picking doors, heavy doors at that. There were doors between 30 lbs and 100 lbs. There was always someone with a forklift beside me helping."
good,There’s never a dull moment around Lowes. There’s always something to do and there’s always someone around the corner cracking jokes and keeping the day fun. They had a popcorn machine and would buy us lunch for having a good week. I was seasonal but I was welcomed to the family and had an awesome time.

good,"I found myself quite enjoying this job despite the long hours; I was given the option to work either five eight hour shifts a week with two days off, or four ten hour shifts with three days off. I opted for the latter and did not regret it. The hours were long, but they were made worth it. The environment was relaxed and supportive, all of my coworkers were cheerful and bright people who helped me with whatever problems I may have been facing given the circumstances of whatever call I was taking at that moment. If I needed help, it was available to me by my team members, or the line of designated members of management who were stationed to help associates like myself. "
good,"I liked the people, the management, the work and the hours. I worked in the lawn and garden outside so it was nice being outside and it was good exercise also."

good,"A typical day at work is very involved. My biggest take away is that I learned how to be a inspirational leader. The management team is collaborative. The workplace culture is good.

good,"You will not have a set set schedule as a full time employee unless you get a certain job within the company. There are days you will close and open the next day. Some days are busy, others are slow. I learned so much about home improvement from my peers and management. If the contractors like you, they will teach you as well. They also watch for the hard workers and will try to recruit you. Work culture isn't bad. Most days you work your department alone and with a hour or so coverage. You will have a department you will cover down on from time to time. Cross training is a must. The work culture is amazing. You will meet wonderful people and build good connections."
good,Great company to work at.  If you put the effort into your employment and are motivated to move to the next level of employment Lowe's will help develop you to be prepared for the next level of promotions.

good,"Lowes, while i was working there, was a wonderful place to work and had many friendly fellow coworkers. doing daily required work was easy and you got paid fairly, though raises werent that great. Lowes started to go a different route right after I left, so I do not know how well Lowes is now."
good,The managers were super cool. They were understanding as long as you didn't take advantage of them or their kindness. The associates working there are friendly. I had a lot of fun working there and learned a lot about home improvement.

good,I worked at Lowes in Valdosta Ga for 6 months because i was seasonal. I enjoyed it. I will even stay overnight and help the workers stock the shelf. I was not a big fan of the management becasue they seemed to goof off and head cashiers were with drama. I wanted to learn each department but i was never able to . Other than that i enjoyed being an employee at lowes .
good,Working at lowe's has been great! Its an amazing work place everyone is so nice and will help you out. You can ask the same question five times over an they will still answer it. Ive leaved alot especially working in customer service you get the best of both worlds. getting the customers that will challenge you and some that make life easy. all in all you learn critical thinking skills and how to handle situations that you didn't know you could handle. you never not learn something new.
good,I enjoyed LOWES very much.  Mostly because I'm a self starter and greatly enjoyed working in the garden area.  I was devoted to the customers needs.  My hobby is Garden design and I have lots of plant and design knowledge.  I also worked as cashier. That was during the winter months.  The job as cashier was boring but I made the best of it.  I had GREAT! people to work with.  REALLY did not want to leave Lowes.  THE best place to work.
good,"Best place I've worked so far, loved the people and they were always work oriented but also very friendly. Learned a lot of things I will surely use in the  workforce. Management always knew you by name, and always greeted you daily which was great and something most work places don't care about. Definitely would recommend to others, great pay, hours and benefits! Will surely miss this work place.!!!"
good,"Stay busy, lots of customer engagement, Management and Staff  supportive, productive and fulfilling job.  Hardest part of job is learning software DOS program for inventory.  "

good,"I fell in love with Lowe's from my very first store in 2006. I came back to the company time and again because they pay you very well, if you're worth it... they know how to run a business and they like to grow from within. The only complaint is, there is ZERO consistency from store to store. I would have amazing team members and managers at once store, and then be very disappointed at the next. I suppose that's just how it works in retail!"
good,Don't care to review poor management would not go back their   my days were OK   management need improved they don't know how to talk to their employees
good,"A typical work day would be handling paper work from shipment unloaded by night crew checking the items in dolly lifting fridges, cabinets, freezers etc.., Receiving new items we offload our trucks, use of the fork lift was a daily requirement, along with order pickers, reach trucks, and pallet jacks, unstrapping Semi truck beds filled with in store items, transporting lumber with fork extensions and carpeting with carpet pole extension, labeling personal orders, organizing our back stock, letting customers and truck drivers in through our warehouse doors, use of cardboard compactor and trash compactor, reporting any damaged items to our in store damage control supervisor. The hardest part of the job was honestly learning the technique of order pickers and helping customers in every department that needed a quick hand. The most enjoyable part of this job was working hand in hand with great team members, being able to help customers and learning how to efficiently work both with employees and work ethic."

good,"I love the hours that i've been assigned. The duties that I have been given. The people are so, so, so great to work wiith. We have cookouts, pot luck meals. We are truly a HOME AWAY FROM HOME.We help each other and our community."
good,"Everyone is like one big family at our store ,we all help each other to help customers love where they live! They are just about always willing to work with you on your schedule if something happens and you need to switch with someone. Very fun positive work environment and lots to learn even after being there for two years I'm still learning every day!!!"
good,Great experience just was not enough hours. This job has the ability to be great however the store manager and some department heads were leaving coverage short which over worked most employee's.
good,"I have worked for Lowe's for 21 years and recommend this company to anyone seeking a rewarding career in customer service. There is something new every day, and we always have opportunities to learn new things every day as well."
good,"The work day starts with a very busy morning helping out contractors that come in to buy lumber, plumbing supplies and tools. As the day progresses the shift in customers moves to those buying tiles, paint, and garden related items."
good,"I enjoy the daily challenge customers give me when they have a project to make. The challenges stimulate and engage my mind, and give me satisfaction."
good,Lowe's Home Improvement is a wonderful place to work. It has great benefits and time off for the employees. Management is fair and understanding. The culture is good except you have to work weekends.
good,"Everyday is a great day at Lowes, Some days are a lot better then others ."
good,Typical day on the job consist of repetitious work; marking items and loading them onto the truck to be transported to the actual stores. With a 10-12 hour work day you receive 2 breaks throughout the day.
good,I had an overall good experience working with Lowe's. They never asked too much of you and didn't put too much on your plate for you to handle in that particular day.
good,Great place to work. The atmosphere was amazing. The management there is great. They were always willing to lend a helping hand. Never came across any disgruntled employees.
good,"The environment was fun and lively, It was also a very team oriented and friendly with all co workers and management.  I learned great team building skills and it improved on my customer service skills."
good,"Fast paced and customer focused environment.  Many different areas within store including sales, installation, and delivery.  Compensation is very competitive with market."
good,Great place to work while attending school.There is a training phase before placing employees on the floor. Management was helpful allowing me to gain knowledge while working in different areas often. I actually stayed over the job specified time and left to due to college.
good,It was a great place to work. I was already getting trained for the customer  service desk. You do have an opportunity to move up at this job. They were also always doing things to keep the employees in a good mood also!
good,"That is, if the company is in the field you'd like to work for. It's not my desired career field so personally I didn't enjoy working there for the business but the people I worked with were wonderful."
good,Es buena empresa para trabajar. Muy bien las prestaciones
good,"I had a great experience working at Lowe's, I thought my pay was fair for the amount of work I was doing, and I felt like I was learning a lot about products as I worked there. I definitely think it's a job where you can learn just as much as you work, and your experience is largely dependent on the amount of work you put into it."
good,I was welcomed with great people and a wonderful environment. I love working at lowes. it gives me a chance to build knowledge about house hold and diy. My managers are fantastic
good,Awesome flow of customers and employees. Everyone knows everybody else who works there and the store meetings you get free food. There is race for the cup on the computer that will allow you to win free prizes through the company and will even help you get promotions.  Be really nice and work really hard and everyone will love you
good,"On a typical work day this job is a cool place to work. I've learned that you have to be able to work with others even if they're most difficult state. As for the management, they usually work with you for the most part, in most any situation rather good or bad. The work place culture is very diverse and I think the hardest part of the job is trying to get everyone on the same accor. But the most enjoyable part of the job is making the customers happy as a family."
good,"Due to the recent restructuring it's shaken the company, but as a whole it is a nice place to work with great benefits. Most people who work there are nice and easy to get along with."
good,"I gave this company 12 years of my life. And I would do it again. The  employees are like family to me. But, with every company you have some bad eggs. And those eggs spoil and affect others. That's not healthy and I'm sorry to say Management was blind to it..Because I was there so long and wanted to move up and I was constantly looked over because I feel I refused to lower my standards. Let me say this customer service is a very hard job. People have changed. They are hateful creatures who expect things handed to them. I just couldn't take it any more."
good,A long day that just breaks down your body. I would not recommend it to anyone looking for a long term career.  i was there for only 6 months and Im so happy I left. The pay is not even worth it.
good,"Lowes is overall a great place to work, if given the opportunity to join the team, please take full advantage! All employees are well compensated and highly equipped with the proper skills to complete their task."
good,"I worked at Lowes in Birmingham,  Al and started off as a seasonal cashier.  Within in 3 or 4 weeks later I became full time as an Install Sales Coordinator.  Lowes gave me a chance and I appreciate it them.  The managers are fun to work with and I met some lifetime friends at Lowes as well.  I also met my future husband there.  Lowes have great employees.  My typical day in the Installs office was working hard at fixing customers complaints about their installs and having a great time doing it while working with three great associates who work with me in the office.  I would definitely recommend Lowes as a starting job for anyone.  The pay wasn't that bad and their environment was fun.  I enjoyed working with the installers as well.  The installers too,  some of them are my lifetime friends.  If u want to meet great people,  work for Lowes."
good,Lowe's was a very good place to work for and I liked working with all those there. Our manager was also very good at what he did to keep us organized.
good,"Lowes is very relaxed, and will typically work with school schedules. I have really enjoyed working here, however they seem unable to help with the movement inside the company when they do not see a direct need to do so."
good,"Started with Lowe's after a 15 year career at a small local company, management made me fell right at home and I earned promotions according to my efforts and abilities."
good,"Lowes is a good company with perfect work environment to work in Mooresville and Charlotte area"
good,"I enjoyed working for this company, I advanced in this company many times. Started as a cashier, promoted to customer service, then promoted to home décor and paint dept. Also I ran the build and grow clinic for the kids and I very much loved that. Working with the kids building projects and watching them grow was very satisfying to me. I needed a transfer and management would not let me transfer to another location. I got a Divorce and moved out of Mustang, Oklahoma. I had to quit was not happy about that but could not see his family everyday in the store."
good,"Started as seasonal in lawn and garden, ultimately promoted to department manager lawn and garden.  Manager was excellent, friendly, worked with employees (he's gone now).  Would love to work for Lowe's again!"
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowes almost everyday. It always seemed relaxed, but there was always a team there to help you out with something. They taught me how to drive all kinds of power equipment, showed me how to use different tools, and I met a lot of friendly faces."
good,No problem to solve is ever the same.  Customers are great.  Management is supportive and there are always opportunities for advancement.  Most enjoyable aspect is being able to work all over the store.
good,"One of the most structured home improvement center. Very clean, and the majority of the time full staffed. Enjoyed working and learning from the customers and their experiences with self-improvement."
good,U work anywhere at lowe at great place to work try new thing so u can let customer everything u learn about the and what's best product to at there home
good,A good place to work and always something to do to make the day go by. A flexible schedule is great..fellow employees where eager to help really enjoyed working there.
good,"Stores are well run , clean , bright , fun places for employees but often longer hours than scheduled"
good,Always teamwork very friendly environment things get better every day would go back because of the friendly staff and the manager are always willing to help.
good,"I have worked at Lowe's for over a year now, and it has been awesome to work there. The pay is higher than a lot of workplaces, they offer 401k plans, employee discount of 10% off, and despite the high volume of sales and customers daily, it is a very pleasant place to work. The hardest part of the job is probably having to work with the occasional impatient customer/contractor. I personally feel Lowe's should offer monthly or quarterly performance reviews as a means of tracking and rewarding quality work, but they pay well from the start anyways. The most enjoyable part of the job is fulfilling customers' needs and knowing you made their project easier. I once had a little girl come up to me after her parents had gathered up necessary supplies and say, ""Thank you for giving me a treehouse!"" Situations like that make working for Lowe's worth it regardless of how the rest of the shift goes! Overall I give Lowe's 5/5 stars!"
good,"i worked as a cashier up front. i loved the whole environment from the people to the workers to the managment team that helped ever step of the way. The only reason im not at lows anymore is because it was a seasonal job, i would go back in a heart beat if i could."
good,Working at lowes has helped me have a new understanding in home care. As a new homeowner working there gave me the proper tools and workshops to help others acheive their goals. It challenges you to know your products so you dont look like a deer in the headlights when somebody ask about a product. managers and other employees are nice and willing to help you in anything. It was an awesome company to work for.
good,Very customer service oriented the employees are friendly there is a lot of opportunity to grow in this company management is wonderful a lot of motivation
good,My typical day at work would be placing Stock to shelevs.  Placing extra Stock in Top Stock when required; by way of OP equipment.  License to Forklift as well.    Making Bail for the trash bin.  Assisting truck Unloader-unload the truck when required.  I also have experience using the LRT gun.
good,Lowes is a great place to work. Management is good and they are flexible with your hours provide you have justification on your requested days off. Co-workers are super friendly and helpful.
good,I love working at Lowes. Management at Lowes are very involved and helpful. An overall fun and comfortable work environment. The only thing lacking are the hours allotted for part time employees.
good,"It was a great teem of fellow workers,a pleasure to work with."
good,"I enjoyed working there and being a part of the weekend team, allowing me to work in all the departments. Manager was awesome as were all the other team leaders, felt like a family."
good,"Obviously I can only speak for my experience in that for other stores throughout the nation. I work for Kennewick Lowes store number 0249. As a corporation the company has been there for me to deaths and my family. Has helped me grow into a successful associate to a sales specialist."
good,Lowe's is a great company to start a career in management with alot of opportunities to advance and develop yourself to go as far as you want to with the company
good,"Anything positive that Home Depot achieves is something that Lowes has put in action, years ahead of them. There are numerous ways to advance, and there is real money to be had by achieving results as a store; not the pocket change that Home Depot hands out for store performance. The company tends to celebrate that NASCAR nonsense a little too much, and your experience can be degraded, depending on the quality of your coworkers' performance. If you are fortunate enough to have great coworkers, your store will destroy the competition."
good,Great place to work.  I love helping others and facing new challenges. You meet new people daily and build relationships with customers and co workers
good,"Lowe's enabled me to make life-long friends and work great hours for VERY competitive pay. Was a great work experience that I hope to find again someday,"
good,"A typical day at Lowe's is very busy i would always be behind customer service assisting my cashiers answering phones,solving problems etc. Hardest part of my job was getting yelled and cursed at by anger customer who would'nt let me help them. Most i enjoyed were all my cashiers/co-workers and all Lowe's did they go above and beyond to make their customers happy they have great customer service policy."
good,I had a good experience working for Lowes. They are a fantastic company to work for with many opportunities to advance. Balancing work and home wasn't hard to do. I would definitely work for them again.
good,Great Job. Awesome place to work. I was their for 23 years loved it but need a change . Wanted to get into the medical field. Sometimes in life we need Change.
good,"Great place to work, whether part time for extra income or career. First class training and development in all areas of company. Family oriented and safe place to work"
good,"i really miss working as a sales specialist there.  The management was helpful and friendly, and the work was always changing.  There is plenty of room for advancement and lots of training offered"
good,"Lowes has everything that you would want in a company. Job security, management advancement, more training than you could ever imagine. They really take care of their employees."
good,"Management is excellent, Clean and safe work environment, awesome team environment. Lowes""s will help employees who are new to this kind of work to adjust to a fast paced environment. Yhis helps to become an employee to represent Lowe""s as a customer oriented member of the staff as customer service is always above and beyond any thing else."
good,"Lowe's is a great place to work. If you put in the hard work, there are plenty of advancement opportunities. It's retail though, so for management, the work/life balance is not always there."
good,"A typical day at work using power equipment, managing receiving, stocking and helping customers. 80 percent of what I learned was from watching or teaching myself. Management Excellent. Most enjoyable thing about my job is the people I work with. People friendly out going hard working. Work is what you make. What I don't like is the biweekly pay but a lot of company's do that now it does make it hard to pay bill on time."
good,working at lowes was fun for the most part as long as you did your job you were cool with everyone . Great company to work for . But not for a long time career in my opinion
good,"I would not have worked for Lowe's for almost 20yrs if I did not enjoy it.  With any big company, job security is not guaranteed. I loved my position as an AOM."
good,"Every day is a different experience."
good,"Lowes is a great company to work for, they will help you set up a career path so that you can grow with the company. I started out as a Department Manager and with in 2 years I was a store Manager"
good,"Lowes is a very different job from where I worked at first but it was also quite an experience for me! I learned how to drive a order picker, a fork lift and a stand up lift! The hardest part about the whole job was getting inside the truck and unloading freight but it wasn't too too bad. The most enjoyable part about the job was getting the know and get close with all of my coworkers!"
good,Working at Lowes was a decent job but the hours were al over the place and the pay was low.  One week I would work 40 hours and the next week 10 or 12 hours.  I liked what I was doing in the electronic department but the hours were not what I needed to live off of.
good,"Lowe's provides it's employees with excellent training and advancement opportunities, the atmosphere and culture is positive and fun. Great benefits and compensation. Can be fast paced but rewarding experiences helping customers with their projects. Typical day is not routine, always a new challenge. I learned that given a push, I could achieve amazing things."
good,"Working for lowes as a cashier was the best place iv`e worked so far. other employees where super friendly, the customers had many interesting story`s to tell, and their was plenty of work to keep you occupied."
good,I loved lowes just had to leave due to family emergency.  Learned to drive machinery and get exposed to different things. It was a blast working there
good,Lowe's has been good to me and my family up till the point of the restructure and I was laid off. I would consider going back. The people that i worked with were great.
good,"Lowe's was such a growing experience for me, I enjoyed working there for three months in 2016. My supervisors at time were all very relaxed and easy to work with, we would occasionally have dance parties to pass the time. The high season lasts from Memorial Day to Labor Day. Stressful work environment, work was fast paced but it was fun to make food, cut meats, and interact with customers."
good,they were also supportive coworkers/management. I learned about different paint types.Hardest was lifting the larger buckets of paint. enjoyable thing was making a customer happy with my advice n help with picking out colors n how to paint.
good,I was not there long the assistant coaches were very non-professional very hyper when things were not working in their favor. It was a very dis-organized place.
good,"I've worked retail mt entire life. This company gives you one weekend a month plus, if something comes up, it doesn't take an act of Congress to change your schedule. They really do try to work with you."
good,"I loved working for Lowes, the customers really made the job worth it, helping people find what they need and having the ability to be innovative and creative was great for me. The people I worked with were great and I would recommend this job to anyone considering working there."
good,"Lowes is a great place to work, friendly environment. This company also offers great benefits to employees. Flexibility for family is good too. Great opportunities in advancement."
good,"Loved my job! Only problem was I was a health risk do to Epilepsy.  Was let go. I was also seasonal. I was employed the amount of time give when hired. Just was not extended beyond that."

good,"Customer service focus "
good,"I have worked for Lowes for over six years and have had nothing but great experiences. The company laid off a bunch of employees recently and unfortunately many excellent people were let go. To me, this is just business and I have no ill feelings. "
good,Company has a family first attitude. Provides several resources to help with work life balance via company intranet. Management at local and company level are very good. The most challenging part of the job was directing and training all types of individuals and personalities while maintaining a professional attitude
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowes, there was always something new to learn. Working in Flooring, it was always fun helping customers decide on how to decorate. There were times when there was a lot of"
good,"Knowledge of what is to be accomplished is key. Communication of goals set by management are crucial to the execution, performance and completion. Safety and ethics are to be applied throughout the day. Multi-tasking and adapting to the performance of your peers could be a challenge but its the team effort that pays off at the end."
good,"I've worked a few different retail jobs, but this place is much different. It's fast paced, but this store has a great team and everyone is very friendly. It really feels like a family. The pay is above average for most places too. I really enjoy working here and  handeling the challenges that arise."
good,"This company was a great company to work for, and it taught me how to work with customers of different ethnic groups, backgrounds, and personalities. Working with different people allows me to be more diverse and capable to work with other people."

good,I enjoy working for Lowe's. There are opportunities for advancement and training in other departments. We work great together as a team to fulfill our customers needs.
good,Lowe's knows how to get things done and we try to get things done fast. They are very good with getting people in and out with the things they need as fast as possible while doing the things that they are on task to do. The employees are very helpful when it comes to team work.the managers are very willing to listen to you problems if you have one and they try to work with you to solve them.the hardest part about the day is when something goes wrong with the register it slows me down with the customers
good,"Warm greetings to and from Associates and Management, walk through inspection, read itinerary, water dry plants."
good,helped customers throughout store at registers at different departments Even was able to return products and walk customers to cars I really enjoyed this company

good,"Lowe's has been a great place to work.  The management team in our store is one of the best that I have worked for. I have learned much in the areas of management, sales and merchandising.  The hardest part of the job is there is no room for advancement at this time with the new corporate restructuring model.  The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people and helping them find what they need and want to complete their projects."
good,"A typical work day consists of a schedule that has to be done by the end of the day and reviewed by management. I've learned how to man a Zamboni, and how to replace lights, along with good oral communication skills to customers. Workplace culture could use some work, but it's not horrible. Management is good. Hardest part of the job was using trying to remember what the isles contained and where certain items were for customers. Most enjoyable was meeting new people and running the Zamboni."
good,Lowes is a great place to call home and build not only a good career but you have a great opportunity to build lasting relationships . Lowes has excellent benefit and growth opportunities that in my opinion go unmatched.

Management there was awesome, friendly family-like people. Co workers were just as awesome and great team-work ethics. The hardest part was having to leave there due to hard pregnancy. The most enjoyable part was the friendly, family oriented environment there."
good,"Atypical day at work was fun and very challenging at the same time."
good,I have learned how to be more personable and be more creative on how I converse with individuals. Every individual that I work with are enjoyable and it is a great atmosphere to be around.
good,It may be a bit of a starter job but working here taught me many skills that i would need if I wanted to be a DIYer. Pay was great for what I did and I was really just a glorified stock boy. Employees are normally friendly and friendships can be made that last forever here.

good,"you come into work with great hygiene and a wonderful personality. you try to help customers in every way you can, some can be angry some can be sad the goal is to take care of them.your co workers come to your rescue if you are crowded with customers. If someone is stealing we contact each other making sure everyone is aware that way we can retrieve the items stolen. i love my job ,i love to give great customer service,i like to change someones day. while also learning new things from cleaning up spills to learning different types of wood such as pressure treated wood."
good,"I was promoted twice within 8 months.  Enjoyed coworkers/atmosphere, most managers were very efficient but wasn't a fan of working holidays.  Also often you could find yourself scheduled to work until 11pm and then have to start at 5:30 the next morning.  So the instability of a regular schedule was lacking for sure.  But overall a great company to work for."
good,I loved everything about working for Lowe's and quickly advanced there. I started in nights and quickly got promoted as a sales specialist and quickly after that as a department manager. I was known as a caring person that loved serving our customers. There is nothing more important to me than seeing their faces after I help them. In fact I am the same way off the clock. It brings me fulfillment and joy in my life knowing that I helped someone in need.
good,It was one of the best job experiences that I have experienced yet. It was a very family like environment. Never felt so welcomed to a company as I did this one!
good,"Resorts was my starting ground, for learning, all the different skills, I have obtained, over all my years there, then the Taj. Last but not least, The Sands. I felt was the hardest, as this was the first Casino In Atlantic City to close it's doors on 11.11.2006. I can most certainly sympathies with the recent, closures and loss of all the jobs in Atlantic  City."
good,"Some issues with turnover in upper management, otherwise great company to work for!  Excellent work ethics....The company does a lot for their employees."
good,"Filled with great people who weren't jerks, it was my favorite place to work and I would gladly work there again. Never was there a dull moment on the job."
good,Working at Lowe's the employees treat you very friendly and always there to help one another in getting tasks completed and answer questions in teach me what I didn't know.
good,I held this job on the weekends while attending engineering school during the week.  I work 16-18 hours every weekend.  The work was fair and balanced.  It offered the proper amount of training and I could always ask for help if I needed it.  The pay was also fair I felt.
good,"Lowes is a great company overall. A typical day consist of advising customers on both quality of paint/product as well as their choice of colors. I also know how to work and the other departments and use all the machinery so I sometimes get called to help in other sections while still balancing paint and it's customers. Management is alright overall but will sometimes expect you to be in two places at once which can be expected in the retail environment. My co-workers do their jobs and we cover for each other when the job gets busy. The hardest part of the job has to be the customers. Each customer is different and requires different treatment; it requires you to learn their level of knowledge and expand from their. That being said when you help a customer pick out their color pallet and thy love the color combinations that is probably the best part of the job. When they bring you pictures of their job and thank you, it can be really rewarding."
good,"From  stocking shelves to helping co-workers and customers this job was fun. I enjoyed leaning about plumbing, flooring, and lighting. The hardest part of the job were the hours. Because it is retail you work any hour the store is open and there is no set schedule. My co-workers were very helpful and wiling to teach me things (like keying locks) and allow me to continue doing those things in which they trained me."
good,"My typical day at  work was always fun and  enjoy getting work started ,getting everything done by  the end of the day. Get alone with all co-workers and Department Managers and Store Managers. Always look forward of getting to work. I enjoy cleaning, dusting, and running the floor scrubber machine to clean the floors. The daily, weekly,monthly, and annual tasks was sometimes hard to do, but  always did my best to complete them."
good,Working there wasnt so bad. I just felt they expected to much from you. The District manager coming in drove me crazy. The managers went crazy every time. I didnt like that managera had their favorite employees amd let them get away with things. Like becoming managers when they didn't work all departments like required. Our cocwrns were not being dealt with. Its like you were a bother.
good,It was laid back  but hours where sometimes changed without warning but over all helped people and watered plants. Had two days off a week and had two 15 min breaks
good,Great place to work. Management recognizes accomplishments. Management very neutral. Room to advance. Lots of opportunity.
good,Lowe's is a great place if you want job security and good pay. They give lots of raises and they treat their employees pretty good. I highly recommend this company to everyone looking to have a decent job with good benefits.
good,"la parte mas dificil del trabajo es interactuar con el cliente por que no sabes que tan bueno o malo tuvo su dia, todo el personal es amable y muy sociable, lo mejor es que todos los dias aprendes algo nuevo no se hace rutinario, el pago es catorcenal y siempre a tiempo, las prestaciones son buenas y los horarios son rotativos."
good,Loved working here. Great staff and learned a lot about the materials with in the store from lumber to plumbing. I never thought I'd love a place and call the employees family
good,"Lowe's is a family-oriented and diverse place to work. Going to work every day, I felt confident that the day was going to go well because of the people I worked with. Everyone had each others back and helped one another when needed. I knew if I had any questions or concerns, I could go to my coach and they would help me the best that they could. If they couldn't help me, they would find someone that could. The best part of my job was working in a great atmosphere."
good,lots of fun good people management was good loved helping customers and hours were fun in over all the whole environment was nice
good,lowes rdc gives every employee the same chances to grow in the company.ive seen people start as general labor go on to be operation managers.
good,"customer service meeting new people everyday,great people working with you. learning new things everyday from customer to associate. stocking and ordering ,cycle counting,merchandising daily,register.daily maintaining department standards"
good,"I have enjoyed working at Lowes for the past 3 years and have learned a lot of real world experience. A typical day at Lowes would include answering many specific questions in regard to a customers projects, and making suggestions as to what would benefit them the most. During the day I will load many bags of mulch, plenty of bricks and a lot of lawn furniture. I have made a lot of great friendships with my coworkers, and continue to build them.  The hardest part of my job would be answering question about area to which I am not familiar but there are many coworkers who are willing to assist you with questions you are not familiar with and will pass their knowledge on to you along the way.  The most enjoyable part of my job would be interacting with the many customers and helping them with their projects."

good,The customers were almost always great people. I loved my coworkers and most of my managers. The hardest part of the job was when i would have to do carts by myself and it was really busy so i couldn't keep up.
good,"A day at any work place for me would be, always having a positive attitude with customers and co workers, and to get the important things done first before the things that could be done in a couple of hours. Also while at work, you should always be doing work."

good,"A typical day I would arrive early in case someone called off and I was needed. Go to the front and clock in then make sure I had everything I needed at my station. I was a Cashier and was trained  to do Customer Service, I learn how to stock the shelves and do inventory. I worked in returns where I assist customers and handle the returns and the phones.   They liked me want me to become full time but I had a full time job. My co-workers and I got along find if I wasn't busy and they needed help I would help the out. By assisting a customer or help keeping their department neat. The hardest part was cleaning the men bathroom I would always get bit. Was passing out Halloween candy and giving out Christmas gifts. I'd buy for the children who came to the store with their parents. I loved the smile that came on their faces. Sometimes the parents would ask for some too. It was a blast for me and them.

The co-workers were just as remarkable to work with and while we worked very hard together as a team we also had a lot of fun doing our jobs.

good,The environment is very open and friendly. You are able to have a connection with your customers and be apart of their home projects. You learn something everyday because there are so many different departments. They allow you to advance on to other areas if you wish to.
good,great place to get experience in home repairs.I worked in 7 different departments. Made many new friends that taught me excellant skills.
good,"Head cashiers are on top of their work and keep the cashiers on task and busy. Management is very understanding and caring while being stern and teaching consequences come from the choices made, whether they are good or bad is up to the employee."
good,Fun work place with supportive management. I learned how to help customers and how retail works. Co-workers are very helpful and nice. Hardest part is the weird schedule i was working.
good,"When I first come in, I look and see what needs to be done.  If there is product that needs to be put on shelves, I go to it immediately.  All the while I keep and eye open for customers and help them."
good,I loved working at this company because the people who worked with me were very humble and i loved how i had a set schedule easy to work around it and balance with personal life.
good,"I started at Lowes as a season customer service associate while I was working full time security.  Lowes was able to work around my full time work schedule.  "

The most enjoyable part of the job is when you know you did your very best in satisfying the customers you helped. I enjoyed working with co-workers and meeting new people at work as well as helping the new workers become confident in dealing with the customers.

I have learned to love what I do know mater the job path, while at Lowe's they have provided me with a lot of training and experience to excel in any career choice. A typical day for myself at Lowe's might be a little different then most, as I started as a cashier and worked my way up from there. I shortly moved from cashier to administrative office, special orders and Lowe's.ca. From there I was able to move to Full-time Paint and Home Decor Sales Associate. Now a Full-Time Outdoor Seasonal Associate. Although that is the label given to me I am always egar to help out any department, jumping on cash to going to grab an order from the back of receiving.  At Lowe's I have been able to grow and am always challenged with new tasks everyday."
good,A set your own pace work environment with reasonable room for advancement. You have to be on the sales floor to advance however as it is incredibly difficult to move away from the front end.
good,"The store focuses too much on the numbers rather than the employee training and satisfaction. Fun and positive coworkers, but higher management within the store do not care much about their employees."
good,"Fantastic place to work. I loved my job as IT Manager and would not have left there if it had not been for a family emergency that required me to move out of state. I have also worked in one of the stores previously and while retail sales is never easy, the store management life was almost as rewarding as working at the home office. If you are a team player and enjoy change and opportunities to grow professionally then apply at your local store. It has been a few years since I have left there, however, at that time, the benefits, compensation package and bonus structures were very lucrative for those who put in the time and effort."
good,"-Constantly busy helping others which is important"
good,Lowe's is a great company to work for. I have a report of price changes that I do everyday. I am responsible for pricing throughout the whole store. I am also responsible for special value signage every week. The most enjoyable thing about my job are the people I work for/with. They are my second family.
good,"clock in, go to register relieve cashier, cash out and bag items for customer offering them credit cards, priority card, extend warranties engaging in conversation with customers  the only thing hard about the job was having to make sure customers didn't steal, i would have to pick up 50lbs of cement to make sure they didn't hide anything underneath.  I enjoyed all my fellow employees.  I made some life long friends"
good,"For me, a typical day could be in any department involving any number of tasks. I learned so much about retail and how to provide excellent customer service. The management (Oakland Park) are always available to help with training and mentoring. I love my coworkers and how we all pitched in to help each other get things done. The hardest part of the job is trying balance getting daily tasks accomplished and giving customers the exceptional service they deserve. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers and helping them through many home improvement projects. It feels great when you get a repeat customer, that you helped, tell you that they finished a project and would like your help with the next one."
good,It is wonderful to work at Lowe's because of the co-workers. The management is very easy to work for. A typical work day goes by very quickly. The offseason isn't that bad as well. Overall a great job.
good,A day at Lowe's is usually very busy. It's a great place to start a career in retail due to the nature of management and customers. The management is always ready to lend a hand. Co-workers are always positive and friendly. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people find what they want to improve their home.
good,"Lowes was a very fun place to work. Even though it is a very busy place, it was fun because the employees and mangers were not always serious. At this job I learned to focus and pay proper attention while ringing up customers items."
good,"Lowe's is the best if you're willing to put your best foot forward.  You can advance quickly to ASM, but store manager is tougher to get into for obvious reasons.  People are great and management takes care of you if you do what you're supposed to."
good,Alot of different people and good building skills. I love the shift I'm on and love the teamwork. This company also help you grow and let you be whatever you want. Lowes have a open door policy.

good,a typical day would consist of carrying out bags of mulch and bricks and loading them in the customers car for them. When the day is over it was time to re-stock the shelves using a gas lift or cherry picker fork lift. i learned the different types of soils and mulch. The management was great they would answer any question anyone had. I had plenty of help from my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was carrying stones and loading them when they were to heavy. The most enjoyable part of the day was being able to interact with other people on a daily basis.
good,This was a great learning experience for me - taught me a lot about big box thinking and how impressed I was to learn of the advancement opportunities.
good,I was transferred all over the US and at the time I loved the travel but when I wanted roots in a community the position that I held - Regional Commercial Sales Manager - required 75-90% travel. I was trying to build a family and it just didn't match a life balance.
good,"To me a typical day was always high volume when I first got in. Especially with the shipping and receiving, but things usually slow down with in a couple of hours. The staff made the job more satisfying."

good,"Started out as a Team Lead in the Hardware Department."

good,"I felt that this was a very laid back work environment because there wasn't  extreme, extreme pressure to finish tasks.  As long as you knew the routine, stayed busy, Lowe's had a lot to offer a hard-working, loyal person who was willing to open themselves up for advancement.  Being there for as long as I was management would change again and again so you were never used to the same management for a long period of time."
good,"Loader: Days started slow, but as the sun rose in the sky things picked up. Any given day I'd find myself juggling four or five different orders with pockets filled with customer receipts. Despite how hectic the height of the day would be, I kept things together and got customer orders pulled and loaded. "

good,Its exciting to meet new people everyday as well as seeing our loyal customers. Always learning something new which keeps me on my toes and the team at Lowes is awesome! Everyone helps each other to succeed. The hardest part of the job is telling someone we don't have a product or don't offer a service but when that situation arises I at least try to Google or help them find a solution to the problem. Usually when I go out of my way to help a customer they appreciate the effort and go away happy anyway. I enjoy doing a good job and making a difference in someone's life. That's the best part of my job.
good,Mostly amazing. A change in retail that makes you feel good about helping people. Benefits are great for people. Easy if you just do the job.

I was given freedom while accomplishing tasks that allowed using creativity and personal knowledge along with critical thinking skills."
good,exciting place to work with great people to work with. You can learn so much about the business. My time there was excellent!  A typical day at work would be morning meeting then we execute like a team.
good,"I would come in and take calls, usually about 60-120 calls a day and still enjoyed it. I learned that there is a lot that goes on behind closed doors to get products out to stores and customers. The management team did a very good job in supporting and giving opportunities where needed. The people I worked with were very helpful and friendly and willing to help me out in any situation. Same went for everyone else that needed help. Hardest part of the job is learning all the systems and where you need to go and what you need to be in to get the correct information. Most enjoyable part was having all the support around that was needed and then some. Never had issues with management and/or other employees."
good,Our employees enjoy going to work. We all work to the advantage of a spectacular shopping experience for our contractors and DIY customers.
good,The independent contactors are treated as employs and have access to needed areas without restrictions. Management is there in all prosesses of the job to assist if needed.
good,Lowes was a great place to work but had minimal advancement opportunity in my area as the management staff lived here so there was little turn over in higher positions.

After going to get my vest from my locker I go to customer service to look for any IRPs, which are items that need to be down stock  and put on the shelf for customers to buy. Then to start on the work list that our Department manager or Zone manager wants us to do. Usually its working on a project or zone and cleaning up the department."
good,"great place to work at. a lot of opportunities were given. a lot of work activities with holidays, birthdays, health, charities"
good,"a typical day at work is ordering and making sure every order is just right for the customer. Also good communication is a must especially when i comes to customers. Ive learn that the customer is always right and you should take that extra mile to ensure that the customer is happy. The hardest part of my job is down stocking because there are alot of things that need to be down stocked but you not get to it in time, so it is also good to plan your day/night out really well. The overall most enjoyable part of my day is seeing every customer happy with anything that is purchased."
good,As a cashier I have to be calm with angry personalities and get to be vivacious with lively ones. Our customer base is half homeowner and half contractor. Some folks have no clue and expect free advice. Some contractors act like you are there to only serve them. If you get along with your coworkers they will have your back.
good,"Lowe's has a great environment to promote great sales to our competition and our community. They ensure that we give great customer experience, and ensure that you'll get what your looking for. The energy in this is workplace is high like in any retail experience. My typical day revolves around, promoting sales, giving customer tips and personal experience about items and equipment, stocking equipment, and making sure we help anyone to the best of our knowledge. One of the hardest areas of this job, is ensuring that you help everyone, but sometime the demand of customers is more then our staff can handle, which can make obstacles. However, by following up on a customer and ensuring they had excellent customer experience, and happy with what they purchased, is the most enjoyable part."
good,"Pulling from computer and printing off daily Pricing report"
good,"Everyday I learn something new.  I assist customers with purchases and products to improve their home.  I worked my way up form cashier to Department Manager.  It is a fast paced environment, with excellent growth potential.  I learned how to work as a team to promote sales, a safe working environment for employees and customers, to use new technology with the changing culture, and to offer customers wonderful customer service.  The hardest part of my job is effecient time management.  Everyday we face new challenges that you have to react to ina fast paced changing environment.  The most enjoyable part of my job is enteracting with customers."
good,"I have nothing negative to say about Lowe's.  This is the best company I have ever worked for because everyone is productive and gets the job done and I think the reason for that is this company respects it's employees and everyone from cashier to store manager interacts with each other in a positive manner.  It seems regardless of lower or higher positions within the company, we're all getting it done together and I believe that these things combined create great employees."

Despite the hard nature of work (warehouse environment), employees have high job satisfaction due to employee incentives and soft management style. "
good,"This was the best working experience I have had to date."

good,"Lowe's is a wonderful job to have, I enjoy my everyday customer experiences. I can honestly say that the team that we have are great, from the top of management to the bottom.  My purpose of job searching now is to obtain more experience and stability."
good,"I got to create really good relationships with customers helping them with their around the house painting projects. I learned that putting a smile on your face can turn any customers bad day into a good day. I enjoyed working with all my co-workers, they always had a positive attitude. The hardest part about my job was not being able to solve everyone's issues with their paint. The most enjoyable part of my job I would have to say is the customers."
good,"Lowes has been one of the best companies I have ever worked for. I started out low on the list and I have moved my way up very quickly once I moved to a market that needed professional, loyal and motivated employees like myself. I am now a professional HRM and looking to move up again now that I have my Masters degree."
good,"Great Company - has a lot to offer it employees."

good,"Gained knowledge and experience in the use of a stand-up and a sit-down forklift, electric pallet jack, squeeze paddle, and an RF scanner. Met and worked with many friendly and enjoyable people. Loved the 4 ten hour a day workweek. Company provided many perks for their employees. Hardest part of job was enduring the heat in the summertime."
good,"Learned a lot about the electrical, plumbing, and general maintenance needs of a home owner. Also a lot about the different appliance regarding features and benefits. Co-workers were very willing to teach me the skills I needed in order to better assist customers with their needs."
good,I would walk into work and immediately feel needed and helpful. When you work in retial you never know what the day will bring. I was lucky to have a supportive management team. The only reason I don't work there now is the hours you have to be available. I am married to military who is gone a lot and with three kids being there super late and super early got to be to much.
good,I work Monday thru Friday from 7 in the morning til usually 4 in the afternoon. I do resets and signage day to day. I am the department manager of the Product Service group. The hardest part of my job is trying to complete the weekly tasks as well as getting pulled for other things throughout the store.
good,"Always learning, great mentors and superior staffing. Incredible data and dediction to service."
good,"I worked in the Call Center for Lowes as an Outbound Survey Associate, which means that an auto dialer dialed customers and I asked them scripted survey questions about their installations through Lowes. I learned a lot from this job, such as how different type of installations were done and how long things take to be completed, etc.  Management was decent, it changed a lot, which caused some confusion. My coworkers were all amazing people. That is what made the job tolerable. Repeating a verbatim survey hundreds of times a day was very frustrating at times, and the coworkers are what made it tolerable. The hardest part of the job was dealing with some of the Mountain Time and Pacific Time people. They seemed to be the most rude people and would chew you out in a heartbeat. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to people from all over the country and getting to help them if they were having issues with their installation."
good,I loved working at Lowe's because I am a very creative person and I love embarking on unknown projects to learn and gain more inside to the learning of new things. I think it's a big place for me to get lost in and embracing projects that I would have never tackle before .
good,"friendly environment, helpful coworkers, very understanding, good pay flexible hours"
good,"On a typical workday, I would assist customers with different questions throughout the store, and make installed sales and product sales.

good,"Working at Lowe's has been a great experience, every one has a good attitude and are easy to work with. Its great to work with our customers each day."
good,"Typical day at Lowe's is fun I must say. I have learned how to work on group projects with my coworkers, work under pressure, and become an even better problem solver. My managers and coworkers are fun, entertaining and show good teamwork. The hardest part of my job is having to tell customers if we do not have the product their looking for or if their card has declined. The most enjoyable part is socializing with customers, I enjoy seeing happy customers."
good,I had fun interacting with customers and i love the family feel. I also loved learning so much.
good,"A typical day started off with checking inventory and stocking anything on the shelves that was low, once that was complete the rest of the day was focused on customer service. We had to cut lumber accurately, look up prices, and retrieve items of interest for customers. I learned a lot about construction materials and purposes, and also acquired my forklift licence. The management staff was great and I worked very well with all of my co workers. The hardest part of the job was when I first began working there and learning where everything was located. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my coworkers to accomplish tasks, such as putting lumber away and retrieving items for customers."
good,"A typical work day at Lowe's Is very fast paced. I learned to deal with problem effectively and on my own . The management was great , My co-workers were like my family . The hardest part of the job , was not knowing everything and having customers complain . What I enjoyed the most , was coming to work everyday , meeting new people and building relationships with my customers."
good,The leadership team is supportive. The culture established is one of commitment and helping each other. The diversity is abundant and easy to get along with.
good,You spend your day assisting customers and working closely with other associates in a team environment.
good,"There was always a job that could be done.  Keeping busy helping customers in my department as well as fellow departments kept me occupied most of the time.  In the slower periods cleaning, organizing, and working on designing skills kept the hours of the day going. Management was always wonderful and helpful.  Hardest part of the job was leaving and the best part of the job was professional freedom."
good,"Awesome opportunity to learn discipline, responsibility and commitment."
good,"Working at Lowe's in Marion was a fun job, the employees were all friendly and the customers were mostly nice.  I could get as many hours as I wanted. I would go back there in a heartbeat if I chose to move from Florida."

good,"I was a customer service associate. It was an easy job, flexible hours, great environment and great salary! I love working for Lowes!"
good,"Typical day is helping people with all there needs."
good,Typical day at work can be fun! I work with product all day and enjoy it. It keeps you busy being a PSA. If you are a CSA then you are assigned to a specific Department and your main focus is Customer Service while a PSA focuses are more on merchandise. Customer service is the most important so we do help customers when needed. Ive learned to work hard and do not take things too seriously in a retail business. You can sweat the small stuff easily but its not worth the stress. Management varies per store. Co-workers have always been great at all locations I have worked. Hardest part of job most days is waking up before the sun rises and the physical demand but this is the most fun I have had working at lowes.
good,"great place to work, great management. I'm only a seasonal employee but was told I had a permanent position if I did well."
good,"I started this job as a cashier and was moved to customer service associate in outside lawn in garden. A typical day of work started out with watering the all the plants in the store, stocking product, and receiving deliveries. During busy planting seasons we would typically have more than one delivery being received right after another. I received product, inputted the data from the invoices in our system and filed the paper work. I learned quickly how to solve customer's yard problems including, grass and pests. I learned what plants would be best for each customer's needs. I would carry a wireless store phone that allowed me to answer calls from anywhere and occasionally worked the register. During my last year there, I was a licensed fork lift operator. The management and co-workers were easy to work with. I learned a lot from the people above me and caught on very quickly. I enjoyed working with the people in my department, as well as everyone else in the whole store. The hardest part of this position was mainly having to work with outdoor climates when they would be either extreme hot or extreme cold. The most enjoyable part of this job was working with the plants and different related products."
good,"A typical day at work is never the same. There is always something to be worked on or stocked. I learned how to help the many personalities of the community. With the endless amount of products the store has to offer there is always something new to learn. I love my co-workers very much, friendliest people I will ever get to know. The hardest part of the job is going to be the hours. Though we have a schedule you will be there to the endless hours of the night improving the look of the store. The most enjoyable part of the store is going to be the great team I got to work with and the very sweet usual customers that come in."
good,I manage a group of around 5-15 cashiers a day. I supervise cashiers to make sure they stay on task. I am cumsumed with the knowledge I have learned in the year I have been employed at Lowes. I have had great guidance and reasurance with my Head Cashier position!
good,"Usually a day following my daily duties, normally a lot of interaction with coworkers and management. Much concern with how my day is doing and customers and coworkers tend to be very positive"
good,"A typical day at Lowes was dealing with customers and meeting there desired needs."
good,I really liked working here. I was treated great for the most part. The job itself was fun and easy. I wouldn't hesitate to return to this company.
good,"start each day with morning exercise and daily routine, management was good they often had safety dinners and we received a lot of free t shirts, sweat shirts and employee bonuses, work with very nice co-workers, hardest part of the job was the heavy lifting, up to 60-75 pounds, sometimes by yourself or team lifting, most enjoyable part was a good experience for learning,"
good,"work with the public, making them happy before they leave to ensure their return to lowes."
good,I have enjoyed my many years with an excellent company.  I have met some very close and motivational friends while working for this organization.  I have acquired many skills and techniques over the years working with management.
good,"Working with caring associates"
good,"A typical day consisted of unloading a truck and work the freight and unloading trucks during the day and working that freight as well. Completing all daily assignments as well as assisting with customer purchases and or returns. Assist in key cutting, wood cutting, glass cutting, rope or chain cutting, paint mixing, and ocassionally special orders."
good,"I absolutely love Lowe's and my position at Lowe's.  I am the HR manager at the Madison, MS location and have been for the last 7 years.  I manage job postings, hire, recruit, orientate new associates, onboard, responsible for the employees training and development.  I am also involved in succession planning and payroll.  The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to play a role in the advancement of employees.  The hardest part of my job is that I do everything all by myself.  We do not have any assistance."
good,"None of the jobs are hard at all. The pay isn't the best, but it's reasonable."
good,"They really know how to take care of their employees.  I am compensated well and the benefits are great.  Not only do I get healthcare benefits but, by working there, I get discounts on things like my cellphone bill.  They work with you if you need a schedule change and everyone at my store seems to genuinely care."
good,Management at lowes is what kept me there for as long as I was there
good,As any employer they have their good and bad employees.  I loved working at Lowes and enjoyed the people I worked with and the customers.
good,"I loved my job at Lowes. The people there were like family."
good,"If you are able to work retail (and that takes a special kind of person) Lowe's is a fantastic place to go. Direct Management is attentive and knowledgeable. They are fair in scheduling and advancement. Once again you have to be able to work with customers, and many will be angry."
good,Lowes Home Improvement was a great place to work if you enjoyed helping customers. The managers were great and showed you the right way. They trained you on every aspect of the company so you didnt have to free lance
good,"If I had not been offered a much higher paying job opportunity, I would probably still be working for Lowe's.  It had it's down sides but I still miss it occasionally."
good,"A typical day at work would be about either an 8/9 hr shift. I will be behind the Lowe's Customer Service Desk. Sometimes by myself, answering every call coming into the store and then transferring it. I can ring up customers for normal transactions. I will be doing returns especially, anywhere from 10 dollar returns to 20,000 dollar returns. I will always have to multitask to keep up with the calls and the customers coming in. A customer might come up wanting to sign up for a Lowe's Credit Card application, or to set up a pick-up later/delivery. Both of which take time. Due to this, I have learned great organization and multi-tasking skills. I have learned how to work quickly but always completing my task correctly. This greatly impresses my customers as well as my managers. My coworkers look up to me for leadership. If they are unable to help the customer thoroughly they will always come and ask me for advice. Management trusts me and lets me be my own manager at times. Making judgment calls when it comes to returns, price adjustments, or price matches. The most enjoyable part of my job is the smiles i get from my customers and them letting me know that i have truly helped them and gave it my all. Also the compliments from management means a lot to me. They let me know how well of a job i have performed."
good,A typical day at work is very busy a lots of clients. What i learn is to work with customers. My co workers were really nice all the time. Management were really respectful all the time. There was no hardest part of my job. I really enjoy working with people.
good,"Morning meetings, teamwork, great customers, always learning something new. These are things that happen everyday at Lowe's, it's a great place to work at. Associates always go out of their way to help you. The hardest part in working for Lowe's is....well I can't think of anything. The thing I loved the most is the challenges I was faced with everyday.I had to always be prepared for anything."
good,I miss working there. Every time you have to work in a different department. and that give you an insight of different work
good,I learned a lot of my business skills from working with this company. Whether it be directly through it or through its customers. If a position had been available to move further up I would have taken it in a heart beat.
good,i found that the management never made themselves any better than any other employee very appreciative
good,I've never really had a job where they make you feel like family. They believe in wanting their employees to succeed and hopefully move up within the work place.
good,I learned to open and close registers. I supervised cashiers and assisted customers with concerns and complaints. Hardest thing of the day was closing all the registers. Most enjoyable was opening when I got to open the store and leave around 3:00.
good,"this job helped me learn of loading and unloading trucks on time, helped me get on my feet. i enjoyed working there."
good,my typical day at work was very fun and learnign my first day there at lowes was very hard because i had to learn all the things to do  i learned what to do and what not to do in the situationhe crazy side but some was very  of something that went wrong  my managers was very helpful to me on understanding the things to do in some situations  my co workers was very fun to be around some was very helpful on my first day of being there the enviroment
good,Very enjoyable place to work. Good pay with great benefits package.
good,Typical day at work was customer service. I learned a lot about people in this position. How to react to them & how to problem solve. The hardest part of the job was standing in one place for 8 hours.
good,I grew alot in my time with Lowe's. I became familar with all aspects of the retail business. We were truly like a family.
good,"A typical day at Lowes would be greeting customers, taking payments, helping with purchases and loading their merchandise into their vehicles, I learned how to take customer service to a new level. Management was ok they were rarely around and when they were they weren't helping any. My co workers for the most part was great. The hardest part of the job was getting ahold of some help when you needed it most. The best part of the job was helping the customers."
good,Start work at 5:30 most days I get all the money out from the cash office to the registers.  I figure out what time the cashiers get their breaks.. see if we need coverage. get my dhsr done.. run a couple of reports..
good,"First thing I do is speak with my supervisor to find out what the work load is which is the quantity of merchandise we have for the day and also to see if we had any call ins, so we as a team can feel in the gaps and compensate the flow of freight. I've learned that everyone come from a different back ground and you must respect that in order to work as a team. Our management set the tone because he never cracks under pressure and he make everyday at work a breeze. My co-workers take a strong since of pride in there work, and have a self motivated work ethic. The hardest part about the job is adjusting to all those different individuals and there issues they may be having. What I love about the job is how Lowes treat there employees as a whole. They reward you for every goal the store meets as a whole."
good,"I love working there."
good,job was great everything was great about this job i wish i could go back to working with this company
good,advanced quickly. worked for company for 10 years. got along well with district manager. worked on my own with only contacting my boss buy phone daily. great place to work.
good,I have learned a lot from my job. Every day is different and challenging.I used to be a Cash office clerk and then i moved to SOS/Credit Coordinator position. Management team is awesome.Nothing is really tough there is always a solution for every problem. Most enjoyable part of the job is that i get to follow up with vendors and customers
good,"Everything was what you would expect working at Lowes. Good coworkers, management could be a bit difficult, but overall it was nice working there. Gave me needed skills, and improved a lot f my skills."
good,Team oriented Management and associates. Customer Service oriented workplace.
good,"start up meeting letting us know how much cube of freight is expected to receive in the building. They are very particular on safety. My overall opinion about management there is the have to much but it seems to work for them. I get along well with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is weather.  There is a lot of fog,rain, and nasty snow. Warehouse is located on the top of a mountain. The thing I enjoy most about the job is when all the stores receive their shipments on or before schedule."
good,I've always stood by supporting companies that stand by their employees offering competitive wages & benefits. Lowe's has provided me with all of the benefits I would look for. A typical day is never really typical there's always a new project coming through the door and the unique atmosphere of feeling as though your peers are much like your family makes it very inviting to work for.
good,"I had the chace to interact with cuctomers daily. I learned alot about plants and flowers, management was great, staff was great. The hardest part of the job was at closing time when you had to replenish your department for the next day"
good,"Nice coworkers"
good,A typical day at work for me at Lowes was generally busy. Start off working the IRP's and  have turned in before 11:00 a.m. Then I would write work list for the associates that were coming in to work their shift in my department. Once my associate arrived to give coverage I would then work on my two weekly reports which consisted of inventory and sales. All while continuing to give exceptional customer service throughout the day.
good,"love the customers that come in polite,funny.managers have good employee relations express them self well and professionally ."
good,"Great place to work "
good,"Co workers where friendly, learned how to deal with angry customers and how to keep them calm"
good,"My typical day at Lowe's was busy and fun. There was always something that needed done or another department that needed help; I like to stay busy. I learned a lot about home improvement and what I want out of an employer from this company. I loved the feeling of walking into work and being greeted by my co-workers as if we were all long lost relatives. The work environment was very supportive and fun, made possible by VERY understanding management. The hardest part of working for Lowe's was making the decision to leave for a job a bit closer to home, with less benefits."
good,I would either go to the Appliance or Plumbing department and assist in customers questions.
good,"great working conditions with saftey oriented management staff, better than most with break times and lunch times, never gets dull"
good,"Learned a lot about certain things that I was not experienced in that would better my life, until I received my position at Lowe's "

good,Working at Lowes its a great place. the management is great everyone works as a team. co workers are nice and the customers are all friendly to everyone.
good,"Good company to work for, but not enough job security.  Offers educational reimbursement also."
good,"Answer phone calls, bookkeeping, accounts payable and recievable, inventory control"
good,"Friendly,Fast Paced, Great hours, I learned alot about flowers, trees, and landscaping in general"
good,challenging many task to be juggled and management provides you with all the tools you need to help the customer and yourself to advance. Co-workers do their part in making the shopper feel like they've made the best choice as far as shopping at lowe's. The hardest part of my job is trying to ensure that every customer get's the best service possible and the most enjoyable thing is trying to meet the need of every customer no matter how big or small...
good,"A typical day at work consists of greeting and assisting customers with either finding solutions to problems or idea generation for project completion. I am responsible for maintaining interpersonal customer relations and installation execution files, along with new business generation and team development. This is an amazing company with above average pay and benefits. The culture and daily mantra of this organization consists of customer focus and maintaining an excellent service reputation. The team I work with is outstanding and full of experts in their field. They are extremely knowledgable and highly proficient in relating to a customer and giving 110% to successfully resolve any issues the customer may have and provide A+ customer service to provide all information available for the customer to become educated and assisted in any project or endeavor they may take. The rotating schedule has to be the most difficult aspect in working with this company. Maintaining a work/life balance is rather tricky at times."
good,A typical day at work starts after I clock in. We set up the receiving area and we start unloading the RDC truck. We pull the loaded pallets to the departments. The receiving manager directs us to a department to assist sales people stock shelves until shift ends. What I learned at Lowes was how stores receive the freight and how to unload. The management was down to earth. The hardest part of the job was first learning how to use order-pickers and unloading very heavy freight. The most enjoyable part of the job was using the order pickers after I was trained on how to use them the meeting new people and learning new things.
good,"Loved working at Lowes, great company took good care of their employees. "
good,Hard work pays off at Lowe's.  Hours vary from early am to late pm making balance of home and work difficult.
good,"Lowes is a wonderful place to interact with people and learn home improvement at the same time.I learned so much about installing the very things that make a home function,from doors to installing toilets, to painting ,to installing water heaters, to installing any kitchen appliance..My co-workers easily became family to me, and they were always considerate..I've worked in 7 different Lowe's stores and always the same result.Personality took me a long ways with this company.from people willing to teach me things about products and departments I had no clue about in the beginning, to getting promotions left and right.The hardest part of my job was covering 2-3 different departments on days where we were short of help, or other department employees would be out for lunch without letting me know.The mos enjoyable part of my job was knowing that after each and every customer I help find things or just give information about a certain product  know I was doing my part and being he employee that got mystery shopped, and as aresult we'd get bonus pay for passing the customer service test. "
good,"good environment and good money. good managment, and an easy place to advance."
good,"People were friendly"
good,Managed a $19M Big Box Store with anywhere from 55 to 100 employees. Learned many management skills. Hired and trained most of my employees. Enjoyed working with both customers and employees
good,On a typical day we deal with installer who come in and pick you product that the customers are having installed. I have learned a lot with this new position. I have learned to take one day at a time. To have a little fun while work. I think the hardest part of my job is dealing with installs that do not go the customers way. The best part of my job is that we always have fun and enjoy work. 
good,"A typical day at work is very fun. It can be stressful at times, but that's all workplace. I'm all over the front end, for example, I'm used in customer service, lumber, and just the regular front end. I adore my co-workers because we are a big family that are always helping each other out. The hardest part of the job is not having enough cashiers to help out. Sometimes the sales floor associates don't want to help out, which means us, the cashiers have to take over the floor at some point. I have taken care of a flooring order which was hard for me because I don't know anything about flooring. Luckily working at Lowes long enough, I picked up some information. I helped a customer in plumbing and sold him a tub that I knew nothing about, but I researched it on the computer. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I know I am needed in the company. They put their trust in me and I would never mess that up. !!"
good,The work was different everyday. The people and the job were great.
good,Unload trailers and move property to the right departments. How to move property fast and without mistakes. Management was always there to help. May co-workers were very helpful. Is all the heavy lifting you have to do. Working in a big warehouse and using all the different equipment.
good,"I enjoyed working for lowes.  I was hired right out of high school and i stayed with them from 1999-2007.  I originally started out in the Sparta NC store and when it closed down i was transferred to the Galax VA store.  I held many titles while i worked there.  I was cashier first, then moved to the sales floor in the paint/home decor dept, then i was promoted to the customer service counter, then to Administrative Dept Manager and finally to Credit Coordinator/Commercial Sales Dept.  I loved my job there, unfortunately i left b/c of an employee threatening me.  The company didn't pay that great, but otherwise was a good place to work"
good,"Great schedule, focus on safety, all the training you want, advancement opp."
good,The employees were awesome to work with! Fun enviroment to work in!!
good,I helped customers in the knowledge of our products.
good,great place to work and to advance. it was only a seasonal job but it paid well.
good,"As a cashier, a typical day at work includes interaction with a significant amount of customers. Lowe's expects great customer service interactions from each of their employees, however, cashiers are expected to portray an even higher level of service as the final interaction before the customer leaves the store. Management is full of fun, energetic individuals who truly enjoy their work and always expect their employees to give their best effort. They often provide individuals with specific goals as a form of encouragement. I absolutely loved the various challenges that I was able to work toward and the ability to create my own objectives in the company."
good,Liked working for them. The place has changed I was employed by them.
good,The hardest part of the job was lifting merchandise to deactivate it up to 50 pounds. Co-workers were wonderful. Boss was great.
good,"Started as cashier. They soon discovered what a multitasker I was and I was promoted to Customer Service Desk. I remained there until they discovered that I had great sales potential and was then promoted to the Home Decor Department where I excelled in product knowledge, sales and management of my department. The hardest part of my job was advancing in my department. The most enjoyable part of my job was being such an enormous help to customers that needed window treatments but had no idea where to start or how to decide what would be best for them."
good,Coworkers willing to help other departments out when needed. Offers job training with a mentor. Management always helping and evaluting interaction with customers. Get to experience a wide variety of customers.
good,"a typical day at work was busy, management was good and easy going, they were there when need. co-workers were great to work with. the hardest and easiest job was working with customers."
good,"Lowe's is overall a great company to work for. The management ensures every associate knows what is expected of them and offers assistance wherever it is needed. A typical day at work is quite hectic with all the responsibilities that I have. Having excellent organizational skills and time management skills make the job quite enjoyable for me. The best part of the job that I have is the job itself. I thoroughly enjoy investigating external and internal cases, training associates, identifying and correcting operational issue, and all other aspects of the job. The only negative I have is the lack of advancement opportunities within the company."
good,Employee who help one another and enjoy working together. Managers who are approachalbe and flexible. Great team spirit.
good,"I enjoyed working with Lowes, the training and knowledge I received from this company was fantastic. Learning about home repairs and creative projects were challenging but worth it. A typcial day at Lowes was busy assisting customers with their projects, striving to make sure they had exactly what was needed."
good,customer Service there was perfect. it was our duty to assist every customer and ever employee to the best of our ability.
good,This company frequently compensates it's employees for outstanding customer service. How much you earn is how well you treat customers. I would definitely work here again!
good,"I currently work as a part time associate at Lowes as a CSA Cashier/front end. The interaction with customers is great, management is aware and engaged, and co-workers are team players. Starting pay is low, however, outstanding performance is recognized and rewarded. There are unlimited opportunities to advance if one is interested in growing their career."
good,self check cashier
good,"Good pay, good management, good environment. Only downside is schedule. In retail and especially at Lowe's it is hard to go to school and have a social life. There is no set schedule unless you are a specialist. Overall great place to work."
good,"Lowe's is very family oriented place it has everything from kid's clinic's on Saturday to convenient work hours etc. I have learned a lot, everything from managing a work environment to customer servicing.

good,"Going in to work was a joy. Everyone there greeted you with a smile and happy to be there. Getting to meet some new and interesting customers was great. Could be a little more training given to employees that needed it. Management could have been a little more stricter on situations that needed it the most. For the most of it though, I really enjoyed and loved my job."

I have definately learned how to muli- task and always put the customer first also how to be more prompt and efficient in the workplace. Co-worker/Management were always helpful and gave great advice, feedback on the work performance and always stressed to work together as a team.

good,"I really enjoyed Lowes! It is a great down to earth place to work. The people are nice, customers are nice, and overall experience was great! I would still be working there to this day if I did not move! Job can be overwhelming at first due to the size of the warehouse and getting to know where everything is. Once you get used to the flow of things, it is very enjoyable. I was a Cashier and really enjoyed working for this company!"
good,"A typicable day at work I would clock-in, walk into the locker/break room, put on my vest, report to a head cashier, be assigned to a register, straighten up my register area, cut on my light, stand at the end of my register, greet customers as they work by, ring customers up, I would call other departments if I needed information on a product.

The rest of the day is stocking, pricing and customer service. Helping customers find what they need to complete the task they face, at the price range that best fits them. Management was very respectful. I never felt under appreciated. The hardest part of the job was simply having to climb up a tall ladder repeatedly throughout the day to retreive stock from top shelves. The most enjoyable part was the interaction with customers and employees, always exchanging useful information."
good,Was always a good working environment with other great helpful and friendly co-workers and very friendly and helpful managers.

good,Lowe's was a huge stepping stone in my life. I started in 2006 as a Customer Service Associate level 2. With me having the great opportunity to advance within 6 month i was promoted to CSA level 3. Then less than 3 months after that I was promoted to Sales Specialist. Working here I learned how to become a leader. i learned how to supervise as well as being held accountable for my work. This is where my work ethic was built and where i matured into a man.
good,"At this job I was able to use prior experience and knowledge to help customers find the correct paint, a better paint, or paint supplies they would need or would better benefit from having. This included add on sales, mixing paint, taking contractor sized orders and preparing enough paint for commercial grade jobs. New painters or painters trying new product would at some reach benefit from the tips i concluded with each sale."
good,Customer service is the most rewarding part of retail..i am a people person and love making contact with people everyday..i learn something new everyday as our technical service is changing on a monthly basis..I enjoy managing 30 other associates and have built strong relationships with some..i keep my business and personal friendships seperate..we laugh alot and work together as a team but i am professional and respectful towards customers and fellow co workers..the hardest part of retail is the schedule..it takes away alot of family time..working different shifts all week also takes a toll on your body as you can get yourself programmed because then you have a different shift the next day..overall i love the business and will continue to grow and seek out new challanges on a daily basis..
good,"For lowes I simply checked out customers, ran credit applications, and helped the customers with what I could"
good,"A typical day at work for me could be unloading trucks, and scanning them in. I also set up deliveries and work with customers to get the best product for them. For the most part me co-workers are hard workers, but like everywhere we do have some that do not come to work and that is the hardest part of the job. My favorite part of the job is to see customers leave with smiles on there faces."
good,good place to work nice customer service neat and clean store great managers.
good,build homes and compenys. worked as a team to do task. lead members on jobs.
good,*Busy
good,"My days at work consist of walking through my department taking notes of things that can be done to better the appearance and overall customer shopping experience when they are in my ""store"". The management team over myself has truly helped me grasp more of an understanding of what it will take to get to the next level and mentored me to be a better manager. The people that work at my store are phenomenal, each person bringing his/her own mix into the workplace making each day more enjoyable. Multitasking can be a challenge however it can also make my days go by faster and allow me to use delegation more frequently."
good,I enjoyed working a Lowe's. I would put on my cute red vest and start the day with greeting customers making sure they were finding everything ok. I learned so much in every department I worked in. The hardest part of the job was stocking shelves and climbing the ladder. The most enjoyable part of my day was staying busy helping people and making sure they were satisified.

good,unload all rdc freight with a group of great people. HARD WORKERS!
good,Helping customers with problems
good,"A typical day at work is getting their, clocking in, and the moment I hit the floor is work none stop. It's fun, stressful, and challenging the same time. I run into complaints from customes and employees,but it's nothing I can't handle, even if it includes involving the mananger. I love to meet new people and work with the public. Some times the custtomers teaches me things about different product that i didn't know"

good,I love this company been there for a year and they are very flexible
good,I work as a cashier. I think Lowes is a very well run company that seems to keep a livable life-work balance. They hire very good managers who do their jobs well.
good,"the 100 days of spring are extremely hectic but great. If you are seasonal you can go from 40 hours a week to 18 to nothing. I am a regular part time weekend team member. You will learn every department in the store and have opportunities to pick any department during and after the 100 days of spring to move into a full time position. I like the stock options but because I am part time I will have to wait a year. Overall I think being a cashier is the hardest part of the store, they receive the most arguments and complaints. Plumbing and Outside/lawn and garden are tough departments too."
good,Great experience. Started as a cashier in 1997 and 15 years later have experience a great knowledge of home improvement. Having 14 years of manager experience. I have enjoyed the mentoring of employees and growth of the company. Looking forward to more experiences and challenges in the future.

good,"Management works with me very well to accommodate to my medical condition. management is very nice, this is a very enjoyable place towork."
good,"The first thing I did when I got on the job was walk my department create a worklist for my team based on what I noticed during my walk. I would look for things like price tags makeing sure they were legible with the correct pricing,the shelves where fully stocked and cleaned. I learned the different programs that we would use to produce sales and make budget. How to use two computer programs simutanisley to perform costumer service at a rapid pace. The most enjoyable part of my job was that I was serving the people in my community."
good,"Very good place to work, unfortunatley due to the economy, sales had dropped, couldn't support the store, forcing the store to close."
good,Good place to work at and shop at for ur home goods supply. Good prices

good,Lowe's Hardware is a customer friendly place to work. Excellent place to work with flexibilty and tuition reimbursment which was a plus for me.
good,"I work with very nice managers,the employees are fun and work hard with me on different projects"
good,"Lowe's is a great company. I spent 16 years at the HQ location in Wilkesboro and then commuted for about 5 years to the relocated HQ in Mooresville, NC - brand new facilities, well maintained and top caliber management - but they have been hammered by the economic downturn and the shrinking, and in some states, the disappearig new housing market. They're probably over stored and still face stiff competition for the consumer's dollars from Home Depot."
good,I learned alot and I truely would work their again. I enjoyed my expereince.
good,Lowe's has more they one area to work in.  At times you can be pulled out of your comfort zone to learn something new.  Being a home owner it was a great way to learn the functions of a home.
good,A great place to work and grow as an individual.  Helpful associates and and willing to grow the culture of the company    . They are are making great strides to to keep the company moving forward.

good,"Lowe's is a wonderful company to be a part of. Indeed asked me if I'd recommend working there to a friend, and I absolutely would. I had to leave because I fell ill for a long period of time. And at the beginning when I was still trying to work Lowe's was very accommodating and supportive. There's such a friendly environment, like a family of coworkers."
good,Fantastic people to work with! Very friendly helpful people. They care about the employees! I had personal reasons for leaving was nothing against the company

good,"i come in water and help with anything else I can get my hands into. I learn something knew everyday whether it's about a plant, a soil or just a customer telling me their life story those are my favorites. The management there is very laid back but, always on top of things which I appreciate alot no one likes someone breathing down their neck. The culture is very diverse. The hardest part is probably the heat and the most enjoyable part is working alone."
good,Lowes was a great company to grow in also their are a lot of opportunity’s in different departments. All of the employees are hard works including the managers
good,"An excellent place to learn about trades (Plumbing, Electrical, etc) Coworkers are excellent and from my experience never had an issue with another employee. In the two different store, I had 1 good management team and 1 that good of been better"

good,I really liked working with Lowe's. It's a laid back company you really learn a lot from your co-workers. So I enjoyed all my interactions with them. Plus I learned a lot.
good,"Workplace culture is amazing. Like a second family. Everyone is willing to help each other to accomplish the daily agenda. If you need help, just ask and someone will be there to help."
good,Sometimes communication between managers is lacking and you get told opposite things but just go with your gut. Customer can be rude be that is normal working with the public.
good,Started this as a typical stepping stone job and quickly found out that the options for advancement were great.  Management works to identify hard workers that are committed to learning.
good,Working at lowes signature market was a rich and rewarding experience. The people there were always good to me and I recommend lowes signature market as a wholesome work place.
good,Good people. Nice environment. Management has ups and downs but so does any company overall it’s a good place. Salary is competitive for the area. I am treated with respect.

good,Lowe's is a great place to work. I have met some wonderful friends and managers.  Lowe's is like any other job . You have your bad day and good days. My job at Lowe's in the tool world had thought me so much.
good,The managers are down to earth and work with my primary job schedule to make having 2 jobs manageable.  There is an open door policy for opportunities to communicate with managers and HR.
good,Just work hard and be on time . Never be late don’t call out a lot. Come to work and be ready to work. Very nice company to work for overall. It’s not hard as long as you are not lazy😂

good,Enjoyable work place lots of work nice people to work with.would love to go back lots of room for advancement can grow within the company good benefits
good,I like working at Lowe's good money and stable environment but it doesn't pay often enough for the bill I gotta pay and that's understandable so here I am looking for a weekly paying jobs that isn't to far out from vanceburg luarel or maysville ky.
good,"My work at lowes was rewarding i  enjoyed the working environment i had great customer relations and had friendly working persons relatationships  i had flexible working hours overall salary was very reasonable  I felt compfortable in the presence of my Bosses i enjoyed that i got to learn as i worked, as stated i loved my customer based personal clientale that i had and to give and recieve satisfaction.which was based on feedback via work of mounth and store surveys."

good,When I was an associate at Lowe’s i was a cashier an all I did was work with the customers an made sure that they found everything Oka in the store.  Lowe’s is a great place to work an start a new career.
good,I like working here but am always seeking better opportunities. I would like to obtain a career with a better work/life balance and not so random hours.
good,My managers were amazing and so were my coworkers. I would recommend this store as a place to work for anyone looking for a job. The only thing that sucked were the days that started at 6am
good,"Adverse weather can make some days difficult, but the work is simple enough, and the pay was amazing for the position and for myself at the time. Management can be a little overbearing at times, but they're also very friendly and treated me as one of their own. Cannot recommend this job highly enough."

good,"Learned a lot about home improvement. A typical day for me would be making sure management kept their employees up to dat on training and safety. Made sure new hires were probably placed with their mentors of their new departments. Made sure payroll was processed correctly and on time and all FT hours were correct. Workplace culture was very family oriented, friendly, learn something new each day. The hardest part of my job would be not being able to help an associate who needs to take a LOA because they hadn’t been with company long enough. Most enjoyable would be listening to my employees stories about their families."
good,I was the assembler  I ran all the power equipment and cross trained in all departments … I do miss working there ..it was not my idea to leave corporate's discussions to out source my department .I got severance pay and a chance to rehire nothing available  for full time
good,You never know when you’ll lose your job positions due to business job structure changes for the benefit of any business and may come without warning.
good,"I think everyone should work here the one in Hornell NY is great to work at, just I feel I don't want to work here forever and want to move on to bigger things in the future!"
good,Would continue to work here but working retail with the random schedule will become a lot to juggle while trying to grow a family and pursue the future.
good,"Every day was different. Some days were very busy (around Christmas, spring and summer), some days much quieter (late evenings, early mornings, Husker football days). I liked my co-workers, as they were a fun, diverse group. I spent most of my time in Lumber, so I learned a lot about building projects from my customers and co-workers. The culture was relaxed. Our manager had expectations for us, but trusted us without micromanaging. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting a variety of people and being able to help them with their projects. The hardest part was dealing with customers who were not satisfied for some reason, but I always did my best to work out or offer solutions."
good,I love my job and shift start 4am off at 1pm Mon thru Fri weekend off. Don't really deal with customers unless I want to training is great some coworkers are good some are lazy. Management is good one is shady. Other than that it's a good place to work discount is OK could be better but some places don't offer it which is good.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Lowe's"
good,I think this is one of the best jobs I have worked at hands down! The management is extremely understanding. Highly recommend this job to anyone. It is a very laid back place to work.
good,I worked for Lowe’s twice in two different states once in my early 20s in franklin tn  and once in my mid 30s in hawthorn ca . I’ve had some good paying jobs in between those two times but over all Lowe’s is the best company I’ve worked for.  My experience was that management actually cared about the employees and corporate showed they some what cared feeding the employees once in awhile
good,"I learned quite a few things at Lowes from customer services, cash handling, phone transfers, helping contrators, promoting product, merchendising and product knowledge."
good,Buen ambiente laboral buena cultura de servicio Buenos sueldo y bonos por ventas mensuales.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was my coworkers. I loved the fact that I was fully involved with my job until I left work. There was no down time.
good,This is the best company I've ever worked for. I feel like the company actually cares about its employees and customers and doesn't just pretend like some companies. Instead of taking disciplinary action for something you could do better on they would help you. Everyone is super friendly. If you're not sure how to do something there are several resources you can use.
good,"Working at Lowe's has kept me in shape, they love a busy body. The teamwork is sufficient. The managers are always willing to pull their weight while leading and encouraging their employees oftenly tending to customer satisfaction. There are events usually paid for such as cookouts or enjoying takeout or home cooked meals or treats, games, xbox and tv in the break room. 30% off all drinks and some snacks near the register, vending machines with reasonably priced snacks, drinks, and processed foods, a microwave for those foods, multiple fridgerators/freezers throughout for store use. 15% discount card for you and another in household.

good,"I was a part-time employee so my personal account of working at Lowe's may not be indicative of another's perspective of the company culture, but for me the working environment was overall quite pleasant. All of my managers were willing to give reasonable accommodations for difficulties I was facing due to physical limitations, and they were quite forgiving when I had to call out on certain days due when my physical issues starting really acting up and prevented me from performing my standard assigned duties. Depending on what area of the store you're assigned to work your job can be fairly physically intensive, although if you have physical limitations like I do the management should be able to factor that into their decision regarding where to place you; in my case, my physical limitations only started to affect me in a significant way after I'd spent a good deal of time in my original position, and when my supervisors saw that I was starting to have difficulties performing the duties of my assigned job they were more than willing to switch me over to a different role that wasn't as physically demanding. Although Lowes' is a chain, each store is run independently from the others in its area so the culture fostered by the managers may differ significantly from store to store; however, in my store all of the managers were fairly laid-back so talking to coworkers on the job and taking multiple breaks wasn't really an issue; there were numerous special luncheons and other such activities put on my the management staff as worker appreciation events and celebrations of certain special"

I work at customer service normally which I like a lot because it really keeps me moving. There's always a customer to help or a problem to solve, and the best part about it is seeing the customers smile walking out the door because you did everything you could to help them. Management does so much for the employees and keeps the store moving."

It was almost as if I found my voice there. Management there is awesome. They work with you in any way they can. The hardest part of the job would probably be standing for long hours in btwn getting your break or lunch. It could be really annoying since it can get pretty hectic there.

Even though I'm doing the same job day in and day out, I would learn something new either from other employees, to newer products, or even customers that ask for help that would be for another department. As I help each customer on a daily basis, I learned that everyone is different in home improvement and sometimes I take that as a tip to improve my home as well.

good,"I as a cashier would run the register ringing customers out while offering customer assistance making sure all of our customers found exactly what they were looking for. I would have to sell replacement plans and sign as many people up for our store credit cards as I can. When the store closes we would clean the front end area by sweeping the floors and changing out the trash bags. Then the break room and bathrooms were to be swept and if needed i would mop the floors. "

Great Company"
good,I get to help customers love where they live.  Throughout the day I am doing the normal department maintenance and order management.

The most enjoyable part would be working, I enjoyed my job at Lowe's."

good,Until the Highland store went in this was a great store.  Highland was in a better location for sales.
good,"I am working since 3 years part time. I really enjoy my coworkers and most of the management. Lowes is a good place to work, but it depends on the people in each individual store."

I would have to say the hardest part of the job is just learning the different areas of Lowes departments that I am unfamiliar with like lumber, flooring, tools etc. The most enjoyable part of the job is actually on a daily basis learning new things that are very helpful in succeeding at this job."
good,"A great company to work for. I have learned a great deal about warehouse distribution, customer service. Great coworkers very respectable. Bad days were limited but, when resources were low it made it hard to be productive. I enjoyed loading non-con."

good,"Lowe's a crafts store on MAJOR steroids!  The creativity factor is through the roof!  There are so many toys - ahem - tools that do so many things and accomplish such amazing results that  it's hard not to get lost in the possibilities.   My personal favorite is when I can get with someone on a given project and we start thinking farther and farther outside the box.  I liked figuring out how to get their desired, or even better results without spending the family savings.  My own knowledge of crafting and art became amazingly beneficial when I talked shop with customers and co-workers."
good,Great job to work at and only 3 days a week. Iv'e learned much at this job and i'm still learning each day. The management there is very good. Lowe's listens and change happens. The co-workers are also very friendly. Everyone gets along as one big team and family there.
good,"A typical day at lowes is great. I started my day making sure my department was clean and stocked as well taking care of the customers. I have learned how to drive a fork lift and other lifts as well. The co-workers and i worked as a great team if there was something i didn't know my team was there to show and explain how and why. My hardest part of the job was not being able to help the customer with their exact needs, such as if we didnt  have the things they needed right then and there. The most enjoying part of this job was meeting new people everyday, helping people one project at a time."
good,Lowe's is an excellent company to work for. Management could use some work but overall a great place to work. It is a fast paced environment but you really feel like you're helping people which I loved.
good,"Out of all the jobs that I have had Lowe's has probably been one of the best places to work.As an installed sales coordinator my job was quite stressful. I was basically the liaison between the store, the customer and the contractor. Keeping that balanced and also keeping people happy could be very wearing. However, the management was very supportive. Whenever I had a question or things became just a little overwhelming they were there to lend a hand. I learned so much in the two years that I was there. Another thins is that working retail can wear you down sometime, but HR always had something going on to boost morale. Another excellent aspect was that they are very concerned with you learning more by taking classes and encouraging you to advance in the company."
good,"Cashier"
good,"-   Receive payment by cash, check, credit cards, vouchers, or automatic debits."

good,"I absolutely loved my nearly 14 years with Lowe's. The only reason I left was because I moved out of state and had the opportunity to work weekends only, with Texas Law Shield."
good,"I never expected to enjoy working for Lowe's as much as I do.  They pay very well, and for a big box store their benefits are excellent.  All levels of management have been supportive, and I haven't met one employee I don't get along with (over 100 work at the store).  It's a great working environment.  My only gripe is the lack of training that is given when transferring to a department."
good,Great company with a great business model. Great culture of customer service and supporting it's own employees.
good,"a typical work day includes helping customers find products. taking care of their problems and handling money, cash, ad credit transactions."
good,"Very helpful team, the management was very attentive to your needs, the hardest part of the job was trying to help customers with their needs the conflict with company policies."
good,"I have learnt so much since joining this company in 2011. The brief examples i learnt since working here are leading/ managing multiple employers, fast pace work of difficult task, and multiple ways of providing excellent customer service. This job is great for anyone wanting to be pushed to your limits and be praised for your hard work. It is also the bad part of this job because they do always no matter what expect 120 percent."

good,"Lowe's was a very fun place to work there was always something to do in one of the departments if we ever ran out of things to do or wanted some extra time. The management was great for my department there were a few which at times made it confusing but still got the jobs done. The coworkers were hard working as well you could always lean on them for help. There wasn't really a hard part to the job as long as you did what you were told things got done and you wouldn't get behind, In my down time i would always go to lumber and help cull wood and front face for fun. Love the Lowe's environment I would totally work there again if given the chance."

I learned about how a retail stores operates and how things are done, considering this was my first retail job.  Management at the west side Lowes were excellent and presented no issues working with my school schedule army national guard schedule.  There really wasn't a hard part of this job in my opinion.  The most enjoyable part of this job was working with a really good group of people that made work interesting and fun while completing our tasks."

I deliver said products to each house, and explain any additional information on their products when applicable. upon finishing all deliveries, I pull all deliveries for the evening deliveries."
good,I was a department manager of several departments according to which ever department the general manager wanted me to improve.
good,Best place to work because we have the best employees! The managment staff is caring and coperative along with great business leaders. Lowes is a great place to come to work.
good,"Typical day at work is fast paced. The managers have all started out in a regular job at the company so they always understand the struggles of the job. the best part is the people you work with, definably a ''family environment''"
good,"Lowe's is an extraordinary employer, who treats their employees like family. The benefits are great for a new employee, or even someone who is experienced in their field of work. As a Lowe's employee, I enjoy the people and the place that I work with/in. Whenever I get the chance, I recommend Lowe's to others looking for a great cpmpany to work for with a great starting pay base, as well as great overall benefits for the employees."
good,I love that I go to work everyday and learn something new. It always a great feeling to help customers pick out different items for there projects or repairs.
good,The store I worked for was always looking to promote from within whenever possible and as soon as possible.  Very good team of ASMs and Store Manager.
good,"My time at Lowes was unfortunately cut short due to a TBI suffered in Iraq.  Had it not been for that, there is a very real chance I would still be working for this company."
good,"Typically, I deal with a lot of reports that I have to review and investigate any missing inventory that exceeds $200.00. I have to validate our Hazmat program is compliant and within policy. I have daily, weekly and monthly duties that are already assigned through a program called Cybermanager, other assignments come from the Area Loss Prevention Manager. I review cycle counts throughout the week, I investigate internal and external thefts. I conduct refund verifications to ensure refunds are being processed correctly and to deter internal thefts. Training new associates, I conduct a new hire orientation with the HR manager. Communicating my findings to the Area Loss Prevention Manger and Store manager. The hardest part is ensuring all associates in the entire store follow all Lowe's policy and guidelines especially safety and hazmat policies and making sure they are up to date on their training courses. The most enjoyable part is being able to work with everyone at some point and passing the knowledge to help them succeed at Lowes."
good,Employees are very friendly and helpful. The most enjoyable part of this job is being able to interact directly with customers and helping them find solutions to their issues.
good,"There is never a typical day at work as each day we as employees must react to a ever changing environment.  This allows employees to never be complacent.  Company allows quick advancement for quick learners and dedicated company employees who show good leadership skills.  Management supports all employees in a team environment stressing the importance each employee brings to the company.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the relationships built with co-workers and the relationships built with customers of the community.  The hardest part at very minimal times is during those busy hour, especially weekends, not being able at times to give all customers the 100% attention they deserve."
good,Its a very fun place to work at. The employees work together as a team. Lowes is a great company
good,"Loved It, Worked there in college. Can't complain about anything. Worked at Home Depot before too and Lowe's was so much better."
good,"Lowe's has been an excellent employer to work for. My years of home improvement projects and my willingness to learn new techniques for old home projects gives me the chance to teach and impart this knowledge to customers. Also, it provides great interaction with fellow co-workers to provide customer service.   A typical day at Lowe's is filled with a hectic and busy environment to provide customer satisfaction. This position has given me more opportunity to use computers. The hardest part of this position is to keep the appliances dust free for shipment to customers. I enjoy my job at Lowe's because of the customer interaction. I can impart my knowledge to them and I usually learn something from a customer; which is a nice trade off."
good,"I started here, and quickly was taught multi tasking and department sorting. I enjoyed my time working there."
good,Excellent staff and Management with a growing commitment for Safety in the workplace.
good,Working at Lowes has been a great experience. They do an excellent job of providing their associates with the training and skills to succeed. My Store Manager genuinely cared about all of his employees and took the time to listen to our input. Dealing with the after math of the tornado was when you saw the best in our store. You could see that Lowes cared about the employees and the community. Most of the management team was extremely helpful and friendly. the hardest part of the job was dealing with the schedule. It was a four week rotating schedule with different days off and shifts.
good,"was really great working their wish i didnt have to move, the work was very hands on the management was awesome,"

good,its was a great co to work and the peole were great the benfits were the best when I stared
good,"Wonderful environment with wonderful colleagues. On weekends, the fast paced environment helps with passing by the time!"
good,"A typical day at Lowe's would consist of greeting all customers, and pointing them in the correct direction they are requesting. Management at my location is very helpful, and is always right there when you have a question or need guidance in a situation. The hardest part is trying to communicate with a ""tough customer"" and showing that you are there to help them and you care. The most enjoyable part is developing new customer relationships, and seeing them return to the store because they were overly satisfied with the customer service we have provided them."
good,Customer service processing returns also credit apps and internet orders. I really learned alot about customer srevice. I really enjoyed working with all of my co workers great example of team work. Management was very understanding and there to help all employees. Hardest part of the job was not having enough coverage but we got through it. Best part was just having a job to go to with wonderful co workers and great customers.
good,"Aprendí sobre la variedad de plantas que existen,  su cuidado, su riego y su origen; aprendí también sobre el armado y uso de productos de jardinería que muchas veces nos cuesta trabajo utilizar; La parte difícil de mi trabajo fue el riego de las plantas durante la temporada de invierno y la estancia del turno en está área con climas muy fríos. El ambiente de trabajo fue muy bueno ya que todos los empleados nos brindábamos apoyo en alguna situación que surgiera, había mucha comunicación y trabajo en equipo así como un muy buen trato entre todos siempre con respeto, amabilidad, responsabilidad y confianza."
good,"Had to leave, family matters. Great company to work for with room for advancement"

good,All i got to say is I love lowes and all co workers i had trained for 14 years i well miss them all if i can go back and do it again i would
good,You are given every opportunity to succeed at Lowe's. The ability to be promoted or get raises is put in your hands from day one of employment. I learned to drive forklifts with this company and learned proper warehouse procedure. If you are willing to put forth the effort your upside is limitless.
good,"I enjoy being around people in the building trades and the Do-It-Yourself customers.  As a cashier I get a variety of locations to work at Lowe's, from the building materials to lawn and garden, return desk and customer service desk. The time passes quickly when there is a steady flow of customers--it's hardest when it is boring just standing and waiting for a customer. Occasionally, we do a bit of cleaning, sweeping, stocking around the registers, some paperwork, nightly closing routines, mostly working with a cheerful team.  It's a job that's just right for me!"
good,it a fun work place it a live warehouse that customers can come shop.
good,"The typical day working at Lowes is one filled with fun and hard work. Who said you couldn't have fun at work? The employees are all smiles and very helpful.

Compensation is good for the retail field, and advancement opportunities within the company are excellent."
good,"Constantly providing customer service and handling transactions. I learn something new every day and I love it. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude and impatient customers. I always enjoy working in a friendly environment, though. Overall, the managers are great and their job seems to be extremely important."
good,First thing I do once I step in the building is clock in check my work email to check for work list. Work on list and if there's any spare time  down stock and fill any low or empty product homes.
good,"Typical day at Lowe's was fun every day you got to meet knew people and people you have been seeing every day. I learned a lot there, from how to train new and old cashiers to different ways to ring up customers to make sure they got what they needed and more. The co-workers were great we were like a family, if someone was having a bad day we all helped to fix that. The hardest part of the job would have been dealing with the slow and old software. The best part of the day would have been meeting all the customer and making sure they left happy."
good,"Lowe's pays very well, with amazing benefits, and actually cares about its employees.  Despite sometimes feeling overworked, I never felt for a minute that the managers didn't appreciate my work, and in fact they would often encourage me and other associates.  As an example of how great the management is, I was denied a time off request because I had asked for unpaid time off; the manager insisted that I be paid for it."
good,"I clock in and go to my department. I take care of customers there and if no one is in my area at the time I get on floor, I immediately begin to zone, stock and front block our products. Sometimes I help set end caps, and do the signage for my department. I am learning to schedule deliveries. The mangement for the most part are good and willing to take time to make sure I am trained properly. Most of my co-workers and I get along fine and we all, in my area work together to improve things daily for our customers. The hardest part of job is the hours. I could use more. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting the customers and seeing to their shopping needs. I take my break then when I get back on floor I sweep, empty trash, take cardboard boxes to back to be bundled. Do a final walk down aisles to make sure all product is filled and fronted and blocked. I then clock out."
good,working at the company was great and fun and i also learned alot about delivery.
good,my day starts when the truck comes in. i unload the truck with my team and it takes us bout 2 hrs. Then my team and I disperse the items through-out the store in their locations. the hardest part of the job was throwing the truck. i learned how to drive the power equipments which i got my License for.the best part of my job was stocking . It gave me a break from that hot truck.
good,"Department Manager of Electrical, Millworks, and Building Materials"

good,I enjoyed working at lowe's. I liked working with the public and assisting them with their purchases. My co-workers were helpful and friendly.
good,"A typical day is crazy busy. I have learned so much throughout the store about all kinds of different thing. Lots of things which I have put to work in my personal life as well! The managment team goes out of their way to ensure you get answers to your questions and try thier best to ensure you enjoy your job. The hardest part of this job, as with any retail job, is the customers. The ones that will never be happy no matter what you do for them. The most enjoyable part of the job is hands down the coworkers and the work enviroment. Everyone is friends and it is like an extended family! I have seen a few of my fellow weekenders go full time, Even as much as I try I have not been able to personally advance. I am a little upset that I have been in the same position for over a year even after my obvious dedication and great work ethic. I do not feel my job is going anywhere though so I do feel secure in my position. Their family values are wonderful, They understand that most of us have kids and they are more than happy to work with employees to an extent."
good,"Scan and receive stock and special order merchandise. Unload trucks with fork lift. Organize and store special order merchandise in receiving warehouse. Learned how to operate the fork lift, reach lift and order picker. Had a great manager and co-workers. Hardest part of the job would be trying to unload merchandise while the dock was crowded. Most enjoyable part of the job would be getting to drive the fork lift."
good,"I did not work long for Lowes before moving to Oahu but I believe that is was one of the most rewarding places I have ever worked. I worked very hard to be the best at my job so that the whole store benefitted. If I kept ahead I could relieve checkers when the pace picked up, help customers find their purchases and sometimes help other employees with their departments without getting myself behind. The friendliness of the work environment motivated me to want to learn as much as I could to help improve the total performance of the store. When I had to leave it was bittersweet because I felt as if I were leaving a bunch of friends. If I ever return to Enid Ok I would definitely consider going back to work there."
good,Learned a lot at L owes. Got along with coworkers and coaches. Left for personal reasons.
good,During my time there I learned that there are a lot of different  people in the world. I loved the fact that no matter what mode you were in someone would always show you how to smile. The benifits were awesome. The hardest part of the job was working in the department by yourself when the hours got cut. The vacation time was the best part for myself.
good,"Review daily installations for our customers."
good,loved working here very busy job always something to do management is good other employees are good learn alot working here and the pay is awesome 
good,Days were usually fast and busy. Learned great customer service skills. Didn't really work around my school schedule.
good,"I have worked at Lowe's for almost 2 1/2 years and have loved every second of it. I am leaving for college meaning I have to leave Lowe's and move on to something else. A typical day of work consists of taking care of the customer, that is the most important thing. I do whatever I possibly can to leave the customer satisfied wanting to come back to Lowe's. I love my coworkers and my job!"
good,"Open and closing the store, working with customers and ensuring great customer service from all employees to stand above other big box stores."
good,"A great company to work for you stay busy which is a good thing.  Management is good, overall a good place to work."
good,Some jobs are better than others but worth the pay and benefits.

good,Friendly staff and management! Everyone is very nice and easy to get along with. the hours are gret too!
good,I liked working here it was fun and very easy job. Every one had a particular job and it was met. They helped eachother.
good,"I would deliver concrete,bricks lumber etc. with 45ft flat bed with forklift mounted on back to customers homes,work sites in all weather perform pre trip inspections, keep accurate records of fuel and customers, also would deliver appliances and install them in customers home, after 15 months was promoted to building maintenance, I made over 800 deliveries with no damage to product or equipment"
good,I love working with Lowe's. I started as a cashier and have since moved to the customer service/returns desk. I love my co-workers and get along with all of them very well. Easy to talk to managers and pay is great!!
good,"This store has a great atmosphere. We worked as a team, everyone came into work ready to work with a positive attitude. Customers enjoyed shopping here because we cared and addressed their needs. We payed attention to detail making sure the store is clean and safe. Hands on trainings were available to educate the employees, so we knew what we were talking about when customers had questions. I learned something new every day."
good,From the start they work on having you finish computer skill tests . That way you can more easily help the customers. Associates take time to help you get up to speed on daily activities.
good,"A typical day at work began with you hitting the ground running. The phone would ring and you are off to resolving customer’s issues concerning their installation of whatever product they have purchased. I have learned to dot every I and cross every T, don’t cut any corners, take pride and do your job 100% because if you don’t, you customers are the ones who suffer not you. My manager was great to work for. If he could not answer my questions, he would say so but would find the answer shortly and get back with me and he did. He had realistic expectations and set obtainable goals for me. My coworker ranged in age from 19 to 60. Some had great work ethics and others were lacking in that area. My team worked well together and covered each other’s backs when we needed help. The hardest part of my job was to call my customer and explain to them that we have to reschedule their installation because we either didn’t have the product available or the delivery of the materials had to be rescheduled for numerous reasons. The most enjoyable part of my job was when the job went wrong somehow and my team and I pooled resources together quickly and still made the installation on time. I like pressure and work very well under it."
good,I loved working at Lowe's. The only reason I'm not still there is because I had a better opportunity come along with Easter Seals. Lowe's is where I learned to be a Head Cashier (Supervisor).

Then i would have a work list to fix the saw or the pipe threader or other thing in the store so i would fix them and if they could not be fix by me i would call it in to our sam work order list on the computer .I always checked with other to see if they need something in their areas and i also would cover lunches in every department . I ran hardware alot and cashier. the hardest part is sometime someone will wait until the last min to tell you they need something done today and it turn out to be an long time to do it . so i would get with management and we put our heads together and most of the time i would stay to do it but have to cut my hours on a slow day. I love it i was always busy and always helping others .
good,"a typical day could be anything from investigating internal, external theft or operational issue. Training associates daily on company programs and policy to reduce shrink and safety liability. Plenty of solid direction from your district and regional managers, and no pressure at all to catch shoplifters but you still give back more ROI in preventing loss instead of other retailers like kohls where you are forced to react to it!"

A typical work day is fun and business all at the same time.
good,"I worked for Lowe's for a number of years, and it was a great experience. Most of the time it was fun, but it is definitely stressful, demanding, and customer focus driven. The pace is fast, the expectations are high, and you have to be prepared to be on your own in an entire department without help. This puts stress on the customers because there isn't enough help, and it puts stress on the employee because there is no help to come to the rescue. But, this is not every store. I've worked in 4 locations, and each culture is vastly different, as well as how the management takes care of it's staff."

You have to remember do your job and there is no I in team. Everyone doesnt learn at the same pace and you have to make a difference. I have been with the company long enough to know that internal issues at any job can be difficult. Only the strong survive and you have to not compromise yourself but do what's best for your customers. If it wasn't for them you wouldnt have a job. Business wouldnt be able to open the doors to employ people. Work is a job not your home and dont take anything person that happens at work. I love my job and wnjoy working for the company.

My favorite thing is that I was a floater and went to different parts of the store all day long wherever I was needed simply because I was able to wrk every department and that made me feel really great about myself and gave me motivation to work even harder. I was devastated when I was let go at the end of the season as I learned i was only a seasonAL employee"
good,"i really enjoy working for lowes but i do think it is time for a new job "

As well as management not backing on a decision that you told the customer."
good,"Cultural diversity "
good,A very productive and safe workplace. We have safety meetings every week and they also make sure our health is good. They really care about your health.
good,This company had just been through a major failed project and it failed because of bad technical project management and really bad organizational practices. So the whole organization had just made a major culture shift and over-compensated with extremely rigorous requirements and best practices. Their entire process was dependency driven and so it gave everyone a really powerful sense of belonging to the project! It also made the entire process go VERY smooth and reasonably fast!

good,"I enjoyed working at the site I was assigned to. It was an easy job, very laid back environment and very kind employees. I had a very communicative co-worker which was a huge plus... but management was not great at all and couldn’t deal with it anymore. i’ve never seen my manager a day in my life and only ever communicated through text messaging. No back-up staff to cover for the very few days I was sick, and was asked to go in anyways..."

good,"Loved loved my job there, the people, the customers who would come to me rather than someone else.  Great company to work for, they had events were they would treat us to lunches.  Hardest part of job was probably dealing with customer complaints.  Sometimes you just couldn't/t make them happy.  My most enjoyable part of my job, was my customers.  I see them out in public and they always tell me they miss me."

good,Team members work hard to bring an amazing service to public with great people onboard handling any difficulties with great attitude and confidence without mentioning the exceptional support coaches do.
good,I would work at Lowes again. This was one of my favorite jobs. They are easy to work for and they value family problems. They are understanding and flexible with work schedules.

They gave good benefits and actually was the first job I ever started a 401k with so it taught me the pros and cons of that s well. i was mainly focused on customer service and it taught me a lot about that as well. I learned how to drive a fork lift and different tools throughout the store. i also was able to help the sales team finalize a lot of sales and made sure the customer was happy with an item that was fit for them. whether it be a washing machine, a refrigerator or even 50 pounds of cement."
good,El trabajo era fluido y fácil ya que siempre contabas con el apoyo de tus compañeros y de los líderes. Dínamicas de integración frecuentes y oportunidad de crecimiento en la empresa.

good,"My first corporate job after I left the Navy, I was catapulted into retail life. Love the training and love the management. If you are looking into gaining knowledge in sales, this is the perfect place. Don't be late. Don't complain without a solution. Be a team player and communicate well and you should be fine. If you want to grow as a business entrepreneur, a sales person and an all around team player, this is the spot for you."
good,I worked both at store and call center both well organized and managed. Rules were very clear and management was there to help always. Benefit were okay. Health Insurance was expensive for such big company. You are always able to track your progress.  Attendance was big

Then I fill out a report and move on to pricing. I do price audits so I take the old price off and put the new price on. As an electrical associate customers always come first so I find out there needs and wants if we may not have what they need I will find something similar so everyone leaves happy and satisfied."

good,I have worked for Lowes on and off for years. I started as a seasonal employee but because I worked hard and was reliable I became fulltime right away. I have worked at several stores and every store I have had the exact same amazing experience. Lowes truly believes that if you work hard and you want to learn new skills within the company all you have to do is ask a supervisor or anyone in management. They will give you the opportunities you want as long as you show them you are willing to do the hard work. As a female I felt really valued and when I worked hard it was always recognized and appreciated. I was never turned down from anything as long as I gave it my all. Some positions were harder than others but every person in management I ever dealt with was always willing to coach me in any area to improve my performance. I truly feel Lowes is the epitomy of what a company should be because of how well I was always treated. I always find myself going back to Lowes because it was always a fun job that constantly challenged me and I was always learning and doing new things. They have a lot of women in upper management all over the country and I loved that because they truly believe in treating women as equals. I was never treated in any way other than respect and dignity!!!!
good,A typical day at lowes was stress free and well prepraed I learned more on how to act towards customers and how fto remain calm when things didnt go right .

good,"Liked working there, enjoyed the atmosphere. Good working environment. They cared about safety. They made sure poiiceys were followed. Compensation was good."
good,"This job is physically demanding and fast paced.  The ability to walk a lot and focus is imperative.  Lowes stresses safety as a priority.  We don't have many vacation days and we do have mandatory overtime during the busy season.  Management is nice enough to provide free food on holidays when we have to work.  The most difficult part of the job is too hot in the summer.  I enjoyed the cafeteria a lot."
good,"This is a great company. Very professional upper management, he was very concerned about employees and just overall a joy to work for. Co workers are great too"
good,"It gets busy during the day. There is always something to do such as: putting snacks and sodas away, Putting away freight, putting returns away. Watering the plants, cleaning."

Being able to provide solutions to help people love where they live."
good,I have enjoyed working at Lowe's for the last almost three years I have got along with most coworkers .I have worked intwo different stores and depts.
good,I moved up very fast and learned a lot. They allow you to learn several different departments. I always had additional training opportunities with each department

good,Every one was friendly and very helpful. They made sure that i understood what i was going to be doing everyday. I quit the job because my son had got the flu and i had to stay home with hima and they would not give me time off.
good,"Lowe's is not a place to work if you want a easy job to sit back and draw a paycheck. There is a lot of work you are expected to do. To work there you have to have a strong work ethic. You need to have a good attitude,  or you could drive yourself crazy with how unfair you think your job is. Do not think you are hired in to do just one job. You are expected to work all over the store, wherever and whenever needed. You need to LOVE people. You get all kinds of customers. Some are great and some are just plain mean. You can't take it personal. Customer focus is your job. I worked there for 14 years. Lowe's is always changing. Which is why I am no longer there. (My position was eliminated). It has good benefits, and pay. I learned a lot while working there. I enjoyed the challenge and the diversity in the team. I would recommend it to anyone who is a hard worker and loves people."

good,"Working at Lowe's taught me a lot which i can potentially use in my future jobs. The work environment was amazing and i loved how this company gives back to their communities. Doing local improvement  jobs, for example while i was an employee there i helped replant a whole garden at a  local school that was for the blind. This experience definitely made me appreciate these type of companies."
good,I have thoroughly enjoyed working for this company.  The ability to move upward in the company has compelled me to work at my greatest potential on a daily basis.  I am thankful for the opportunity to work for Lowe's.

good,My typical workday is customer focused. I find that the most enjoyable part of the day is helping customers find what they need and helping them get what they need.
good,At Lowe’s I feel as if you have the ability to learn as much as you would like. They are always offering to help you learn new positions or new fields if work.

The workers are very friendly and professional. I have a 401(k) plan and its awesome and affordable. I love my mangers and team members. We are a great team. We are a family.

good,"Lowe's was a company I always wanted to work for. I work hard in selling and making a relationship for all customers and team members of the company. However, there was a different culture in NYC, it was very different then other LOWE""S it had more stability and the Human Resources work in the store is needed to get promoted and show your skills. It is a good place to learn when you partner with the right people. My opinion, yes the job may be fun and enjoyable just needs a longer training program for new employers and set schedules were you could be with your family."

I would love to stay if I could have used my experience in Customer Service and Cash handling to move into full time.  I am not sure how the interview process can pick the most qualified candidate but it is in the way you answer the questions instead of how much actual experience you have, or how you have never missed a day or come in late that matters.  That in itself is very distressing."

good,"I've worked about every position in 15+ stores.  If you are a hard worker with a great attitude and like helping customers the sky is the limit.  If you are just looking to hang out and get a paycheck, you won't last long.  I've seen hundreds of fellow employees reach positions they would not have at other companies based off hard work.

The general manager/store manager was kind of rude and very persistent of employees removing certain piercings whenever they were within the companies policies.

The pay was competitive as well.I entered my role as a temporary employee, working part time. I was offered the opportunity for a full time position and raise but had to turn it down since I'd accepted the position on a temporary basis.

good,"There's not much to say. The company culture is very driven and at the same time based on taking care of associates. The work is always challenging, the days go by quickly, but time is taken to address any concerns that come up and ensure there is room to reward associates for their work. Career advancement is proactively addressed which I found surprising as many companies today don't offer unless you ask. The only concern is the recent downsizing. I came in at a time when the future for several departments was uncertain and several roles were being removed. I now leave because more were removed. As a company, they are good to work for, but the roles available are steadily shrinking."

good,On a good busy day dealing with customer on how they would like to have their dream kitchen. Going through showing them the different types of cabinets that we offered including the ones that we carried in stock and the ones that we would have to order for them. Once they have picked their type of cabinets that they desired i would sit down with their measurements of the kitchen and then go to work on how they would like their kitchen to be including the appliances and the different styles of how they would like to have their wall cabinets. That would be the most enjoyable part of the shift and the hardest part would be covering multiple departments but was still able to do it and get them took care of as much as possible.

good,"work days consist of helping customers and stocking the shelves. i've learned to be respect of other employees and talk customer anger with a grain of salt. management needs to setup up and back the associates working for them instead of giving them, a hard time.as for the moral of the store it depends on the store manager and weather oir not there are people staff to hep out which is always a big issues because they are worried about getting a bonus and hours but if you7 staff it right you can bonus and get a better review. plus it helps with customers. hardest part about the job is training the new employees to the way they should be trained. the most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the friends you make with employees and customers"
good,"Its an excellent business to work for, it definitely has many opportunities to advance within the company. Lowe's is able to teach you many learning experiences throughout the store within the different departments, all around is a learning experience to either advance within the business or take the learning experience outside of the business and build within another career you may be interested in."

There were many things to do everyday, but it was still a relaxed and flexible environment. Many times I did not know the answers to questions customers had (because I was new and lacked knowledge in my department) but the managers and other employees always helped me out and made sure they or somebody else could teach me what I needed to know. Everybody who worked there was friendly and I enjoyed it so much. The job is pretty physically demanding at times, but you learn a lot in situations where you need to use your body to accomplish a task. I really loved that a lot of the time (like my first time working a cash register) it would be very hands-on learning and not just through a book. I soon got the hang of a lot of things, and was very proud of myself. I would have never left that job if I didn't have to move."

good,I like working at Lowe’s because of the people I’m around make work so much easier. I do more stuff like driving a forklift and cutting wood with a saw. You always have to be safe when doing those two things like stand 10 feet in front of the forklift driving whenspoting him around the lumber area or outside under the canopy. Aisle blockers have to be put on the aisle you’re working on and on the other side of that aisle so nothing won’t fall over. Overall Lowe’s is a fun job I’ve worked at.

good,"A workplace that feels like home and the awesome people that come with it. I had some of the best years of my work life at Lowes and memories that will last a lifetime. A typical day I would walk into work, greet and be greeted by everyone with smiles. Employees are walking in getting prepared for work as I would head over to lend a hand to Operations with scanning out LRT guns for team members. After making sure everyone has started their day I would head to my desk area and begin checking emails and addressing any immediate issues working alongside Operations and Employee Relations. I would update the temp Excel tracking sheets, employee attendance database,FMLA/LOA Excel tracking, Input and issue corrective actions, conduct daily investigations on issues or safety incidents. I would do safety walks twice a day focussing on different departments as the warehouse was a lot of ground to cover. After daily meetings with Operations I would know what was needed to make sure we were fully staffed and make the neccesary Temp orders and get approval to create job postings and interview for those positions. Not daily but as needed I would facilitate new hire orientation for all new employee's on my shift. Monthly building meetings, safety an coach meetings were also apart of my responsibilities."

good,"Great company but poor management, lots of favoritism. I had worked for the company off and on for 12 years. The was no store moral on account of management."
good,"Overall Lowe's is a lively kind of fun workplace with your typical day of work being in a warehouse. Where the employees will throw some fun loving jokes but at the same time keep doing the hard work that is needed to be done. The management can be a bit rough sometimes but it is all in a days work especially when things need to be done quickly but efficiently. I would say that the hardest part of the job is trying to do multiple things at once especially when you are being called to do something halfway across the store while you are doing something else. However, the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to sit back and relax on break for a few so you can gain your energy back and the jump back into work to finish off the tasks that need to be done and deliver the amazing customer service that Lowe's is all about."

I ran into a Lowes manger in March 2017 and he asked me if I was still working and I explained my situation he asked me if I would be interested in a Lowes job as a temp cashier and I told him yes but as soon as school started I would quit he still hired me.

good,"Every morning when I would arrive at Lowes, I would be greeted by many associates, I would go to the paint department if nobody needed any assistance and I would walk my department checking for any unsafe areas. Report and correct them immediately. After following proper cleaning procedures for all paint machines I would make sure all products go back to their respectful home and ensure the paint area is clean and presentable. Welcoming customers, assure they are satisfied and understand the necessary prepping, painting and drying sequences. Towards the end of the day I would follow the same procedures as the beginning in order to guarantee the next associate would be able to start their day smoothly. Throughout the day management would assist us in any way possible if need be when we couldn't overcome any issues on our own. They also made the workplace way more enjoyable as much as the other associates did. The tasks that required heavy lifting I would say are the hardest part of the day, although there are many associates that are available to help out with the work load. The customers, associates and the knowledge of your job I would guarantee are the most valuable, and enjoyable that helped make Lowes a great experience."

good,"I started Lowes Feb. 21,2005! I not only advanced from seasonal cashier to Top Ranked Sales Specialist in the District, but I also had my own business cards! Being a unexpected single mother of 5 small boys, I was able to provide for them financially. I recommend Lowes to anyone!"

good,"Very great place to work, great people. Fast paced, energetic and fun environment. Would definitely recommend to anybody looking to find a job that pays well"
good,Lowe's is a good company to work for. The pay is fair for a non-professional's position. It is a great part-time job for those who are seeking to supplement their income.
good,"I started at Lowes as a customer service associate and worked my way up to Head Cashier, front end supervisor!"
good,Lowe's was a great place to work with a friendly environment that made you feel welcome.  Management would always recognize outstanding employees and work with employees lacking to get them up to speed.
good,"Great people to learn from, easy to make hours, work good around your schedule, learn more how to multitask, easy to work with customers, great money for every two weeks"
good,"As a Head Cashier it is typically fast paced you usually have at least 12 to 18 associates that you are responsible for. You assign them to a location, schedule their lunches. You are responsible for getting loans, making change and making management decisions. For example giving a discount, scheduling a delivery, explaining warranties, setting up a credit card, setting up a tax exempt account, taking care of complaints or compliments, giving overrides for various reasons. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with all the different locations, we have lumber on one end of the store garden center on the other end and the front end is in the middle along with customer service and returns. I myself wore a pedometer and average 13 miles per day, I most enjoy caring for the customers and making sure they leave happy and satisfied with their visit, we are the last people the customer sees and interactes with, I believe the last impression is a lasting impression"
good,Great place to work. Everyone here is willing to give a helping hand when needed. Management listens to concerns of the workers. Shifts are rotating but OK. Great benefits.
good,I develop and train up to 25 direct report.  I enjoy the opportunity to show individuals their potential to succeed.  Lowe's is very fair minded and equal to all their employees.  They care.  The hardest part of my job is not being able to help everyone that reports to me see their potential.  The most enjoyable is see my direct reports promoted under my leadership.
good,"No other company today will match 401k and give you paid time and sick days off. Wonderful benefits for full-time part-time Associates. Great leadership commitments, especially in women's careers and goals."
good,"Learning new things daily then changes come and have to learn new things. It was always fun working here. Meeting new people daily, and getting to know them."
good,"A typical day at work stocking shelves, helping customers, operating forklift. The hardest part of the job was stocking top shelves with heavy materials using a ladder. I enjoyed doing something different everyday."
good,Lowes was an average big box store. they only provided 40 hours a week. and it was the same routine everyday. It was a great environment. But opportunity was limited
good,"A Typical day would start with emails and inventory. Unloading freight and in checking items against invoices , quantities, item numbers and sometimes lot a nd expiration dates. Solve incorrect out of balance in stock and assist customers if needed."
good,"I love my job at Lowe's, Its an great environment. I've learned that team work plays a big role when working at an establishment like this. The Hardest part is some of the rude customers you have to know how to control your temper. The most enjoyable part is your co-workers, there is never a dull moment  with them!"
good,It's a relaxed environment and co workers are helpful.  It's a true team culture. Management staff was great and communicated a lot with employees.  Meetings with staff members every morning.
good,"Lowes was probably the best job I ever had. It was a seasonal position, but I learned so much in a small time period. It was easy to move up and make the job a career."
good,I love it! It's a great place to work to support your family. A place I know I can get help when I need it . Prices are really good and fair . Lowes does a good job and hires men and women of the military .

good,I have learned a lot in the short time I have been with this company. The workplace community is very diverse and I absolutely love that. Lowe's stresses the issue of being safe in all activities that you do especially at work but in your everyday life. Lowe's as a company seems to be understanding and caring of their employee's life. I would say the hardest part of this job is the lifting heavy object for a ten hour shift but it is possible. The most enjoyable part of the job is finishing all of your assignments and being able to help coworkers and get their work done.
good,"There are lots of good managers"
good,"A typical day at work was always busy. I learned more patience due to difficult customers who enter the store. Management would take too long doing overrides, but it wasn't a problem until the customer is being too rushy."

good,I enjoyed my co-workers and management they made working there enjoyable.  When I arrived to work I went straight to my area.  The hardest part was learning where all the items are located.

good,fun  workplace great people great company for advancement. great pay.excellent place to learn about product and business management is great and very supportive
good,"I worked here for a summer during college and it is the best I have ever been treated at a minumum-wage job. Department managers actually trust their employees, and it creates a strong environment built on mutual trust and loyalty. They also taught me how to drive a forklift, a highly transferable skill and unexpected training given my short contract."
good,Very high turn around they let go of alot of people the managers we re very nice there was not to much room for advancmet in the company thats what I didnt like

The management I worked with was a great team. Hardest part of my job was not being able to stay. I really enjoyed my job, the people I worked with and my customers."
good,A typical day at lowes is assisting customers with painting products that fits their needs increase sales I learned at lowes how to mix different color paints management was very helpful and understanding very helpful enviornment the hardest part of the job is when a customer wants a specific color of paint and we have to do the adjustments to get the color the most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customer get the things they need to complete a project

good,"There was no pressure at Lowe's. All employees were left to do/and were expected to do their jobs without being harassed. I worked with managers and employees, while expediting all orders in the system. Employees were kind and helpful, as I worked for the managers, to insure each order was handled expeditiously.  Each day I was given a report that had all the orders in the system:  those coming into the store, those to be delivered directly to the customer and those being handled through Install Sales. They called this the ""Due File"". Each week, I called vendors, Lowe's Shipping Department in the store, Lowe's Main Warehouse, and when needed, I called the freight companies to get update on arrival of the product. Sometimes, while working in the Install Sales Office, I would call for updates from the Installers and would pass this information to those in the Install Sales Office. If asked to do so, I would contact the customer's with updates. I also checked to see if product was already in stock. Sometimes product would come in and be placed in stock. I would contact the Salesmen to be sure it was pulled from the shelf and placed in warehouse for pick up by the customer. I then asked the salesman to contact the customer to let them know their order was now in stock and being held in shipping for their pick up. Each day, I informed salesmen of the status of their orders: If in stock, in warehouse or order was being delayed. Salesmen were responsible for giving their customer updates but salesmen were not always available.  If salesmen were not working that day, I would call customers"
good,The training was fantastic the company took the time they needed to make sure the management new the business . They worked very well as a team and had a lot of fun
good,Lowe’s Home Improvement Store is a wonderful and friendly place to work and shop. Management shows great leadership roles throughout the entire store.

good,A typical day at work consists of taking customer calls to determine when and where their delivery will occure.  I assit in researching with the delivery drivers their arrival time to the customer's site.  I assist both the customer and the store with rescheduling deliveries and ensure the items are available for each delivery I work to reschedule.  The hardest part of the job is having to wait on hold with third party companies for extended times just to get a customer's time frame for their delivery window.  The most enjoyable part of the job is all the people I work for and with.  Everyone really feels like they are part of a family not just a team.
good,I loved it there . Was a good job to work with my jsd schedule. I had flex hrs but i needed to write down my availability. They scheduled me according to what my availability was .

good,"I had a very easy job. My job was to just clean the bathrooms, HR office, Breakroom, and walk around the entire store & pick up trash if I see any. They started me off $11.30. The only thing I didn't like about working there was that it was boring because I didn't know anyone. It would only take me about two hours to complete my job but I had an 9 hour shift so it was always difficult for me to stretch out my tasks & find something to do."
good,It was an amazing store to work for. The only down fall was having to find another rep to relieve you for your breaks. Sometimes you would only get one break
good,"A typical day at work consisted of friendly smiles, I learned alot about coustomer service and making the coustomer feel appreciated. Lowes is a great place to work."
good,"My typical day was to print out reports and focus on inventory control.  I would look for item that were billed out as a loss and try to recover the money.  I was also responsible for internal/external theft and safety.  Management was very supportive and encouraging.  The workplace culture focused on customer service and customer experience.  The hardest part of the job was getting all the employees to be supportive of the Loss Prevention programs, due to different personalities and work ethics.  Overall the majority of the store was extermely supportive.  The most enjoyable part out of the job was getting the entire store onboard with safety and going 365 without and work realted accident."

Working the front desk we have the internet order were we make sure they get filled to were they get staged until the get picked up.  Then we have those customers who have returns  and they can be all different types of people from having there receipts to not having one and even knowing how they paid for the item, were the system will not allow us to physically return the item due to the fact they have had to many returns on there ID.  Working the front end if it is at lumber, or the regular check or garden center you great the customer make sure they have everything and make sure you are the last impression they have and make it a great one."

good,A typical day is putting freight away and stocking the shelves and assisting customers. I learned how to assist and provide exceptional  customer service to all guests. It was always a struggle to find a manager but they always did their best to assist you and take care of the customer. Workplace culture and morale for the most part was good unless business was struggling with hitting their sales goals. The hardest part of the job was when you would be by your self and they would expect you to complete tasks that would require another person. The most enjoyable part was when your store went a month without an employee injury and the company would provide a barbeque.

Then it was all about them suddenly I wasn't a team player anymore,but other than that I loved working for them.  I cried at the the end of my seasonal time up. I couldn't handle not getting chosen again so I went else where."
good,Never a slow down period.  continuous work. a typical day is 8 to 5 Monday thru Friday.  managers are responsive and have your back.  I would recommend anyone for Lowe's

I learn from watching managers around me and how the handle situations, everyone from maintenance workers to the store managers have incredible work appreciation skills, nobody is too good to sweep up trash or hold a door for someone.

good,"After clocking in I start my day by taking a 10-15 minute walk around the store for observation. Because I don't start my shift when the store opens there's always guest in the store already. this way I can see who is in the store and get a feel for what is going on. I can see if there's anything out of the norm that needs my immediate attention. After that I check my emails and then watch the camera's to continue to look for suspicious things. Every couple of hours I will walk the store again to get a real eye on things. The hardest part of my job is having to be 1,000% sure that a person has something on them before being able to stop and question them. If they get into a blind spot or out of your vision for even 1 second that is enough time for them to have put back an item and cause you to not be sure they have merchandise on them."

There were times I delivered with the 30' Flatbed with the Moffett forklift on the back, to deliver building materials.  Other times I drove the box truck to deliver appliances.  We would pull the appliances or building materials, load them on the truck, and deliver them.  I was on the flatbed by myself, but with the box truck I always had a ride-along.  It takes two people to deliver appliances.  The most difficult ones to deliver were the large cubic foot refrigerators; they can weigh up to 400#.  We would have to take the doors off the fridges and the customer's houses at times, and many times we had to carry them up to the second floor."

The culture there lets people build skills that fit their personalities while pushing the employee to do more in a way that isn't hard on the employee. No one is going to be critical of you unless your simply not trying. They will give you reasonable raises every year and they are also not going to fight the employees when there is an emergency or if someone has an illness.

good,Doing the shipping for Lowe's was not what I had expected.  We would have to fill the trailers to the top without any equipment and space would be tight.  You had your own area to work in and they had lights to go buy.  For instance if it was red you were behind on your work.
good,"If I was first shift I would open the department with reading an invoice of items that needed to be located and counted. After completing the inventory sheet I would turn it over to management Then I would shelve any new items that had arrived over night. The rest of my day would involve assisting customers with design choices, offering advice on which tools would best help them complete a project and mixing custom paints. "

good,"Work was busy (had to be focused) learned to work with the public first hand and customers, management was good and co-workers were good to a point. the hardest thing about the job was pulling refrigerators through customers yards when it was snowing and raining.

good,"A typical work day at Lowes is exciting and rewarding. I learned the retail side of business from a management standpoint.  I had great co-workers in the store and I worked very close with my counter parts from other stores to help them in any manor since I was one of the senior specialist. I worked  independent with minimum supervisory, I controlled my own hours which were usually more than expected to meet customer needs. The most enjoyable part of my job is watching the final product once the work was completed."
good,"From hourly pay to benefits to management, I can't say anything negative about this company. The atmosphere is great and there's never an ending to learning and opportunities for advancement."
good,mostly gen labor maintained the stores high traffic arias loading and unloading customers vehicles with merchandise

good,Best part of the job was delivering merchandise and helping set it up. positive work environment. great sales experience.

I learned how to run reports , how to make labels, how to run a department on a budget and watch for shrink (theft). Management was good. They taught me how to run reports , read reports and follow a budget . Co-workers were excellent we were like a family. One of the hardest things about the job was watching people steal and not being able to do anything about it. They started doing a down stocking report and only allowed us two holes on shelves that had top stock ,and would write me up if there were any more than two holes. The most enjoyable part of the job were the manager meetings every Tuesday and the people I worked with."

Even though I worked at night I felt like I was working for the sake of the customer. I liked the variety of the job. I would punch in for my shift and then head to the receiving area to see what the unloaded merchandise looked like. Then I would hop on a forklift and help the supervisor take the product to the floor for the guys. This would last about two hours and then after the first break I would usually start my own areas which were flooring, millwork and lumber. I enjoyed the hard work and the strategizing that had to take place in order to get all the product stocked. After the lunch break we would usually have inventory duties to take care of and then taking the cardboard back and winding down for the end of the shift."
good,"The only way to completely entice and tempt a customer to buy is to make them feel entirely at ease and relaxed during their shopping experience.

good,"Lowe's is a wonderful place to work, a typical day at work would be me calling potential clients and introducing them to any new promotions for their kitchen project. What I learned is that customers would purchase an expensive kitchen from you because of your customer service even if the price is out of their budget. Our Management team is dependable, and we always work as a team. When my department is short handed my co-workers will assist me in my area. The hardest part of my job is understanding why a client purchased their kitchen elsewhere when I offered them the best price. The most enjoyable part of my job is working in a fast pace environment."
good,"Enjoyed it very much"
good,"It wasn't a very important job but it taught me things such as how to always be productive and work as a team with my coworkers, help get the customers what they wanted in a timely fashion and always give 100% in everything I did while I was working. It was an extremely great company to work for and they have great job security and a great team. They had meetings once a week that would help the employees greet and treat not only themselves and coworkers but also customers with respect and satisfaction that didn't make it feel like work and always made the customers want to continue to do business there. It was a great place to work I just wanted something more for myself."

Co-workers had an issue with a female being the boss but it didn't bother me. Management was awesome and when I had an issue with a driver and told the Store manager I could prove to him and the other members of management that the employees where out messing around he said show me. I proved my point and was then allowed to take the steps to replace the employees. The hardest part of this job was trying to get the managers to see what I saw in regards to the drivers. This job was fun, exciting and I was able to still drive the flatbed and make deliveries."

On a typical day at Lowe's, a customer would come in and need a light bulb, and usually thats all you have to give them. But as you work there and you learn you know to give advice from the pros who came in looking for a simular item. For example, going into Lowe's I never worked on a farm, lived on a farm, or used a well pump. Two weeks of working at Lowe's and listening to the farmers that came in needing something to keep there well pumps from freezing, you have plenty of Ideas you can give them. Most of these I never thought of. 1 Use a heat lamp, keep it on at all times, pointed directly at the pump. 2 they make heat tape that isn't actually tape, it's more like a heated cord you wrap around your pipes. 3 They make pumps that produce heat. I went from knowing nothing to an expert on how, when, and where to use these options. The best part is all the information came from the customer. I think that's awesome. Don't let me get started on the different watts, color, or reasons to change all the light bulbs in your house to CFL or LED. Or even what CFL and LED actually mean."

I learned the new system of the register. I am still trying to be advanced at the register. The most difficult part of my job was when I had a customer to my register, after I rung up his items, he told me that his purchase was a phone order; customer service takes care of phone orders, I am a regular cashier, in which I supposed to ring up items and send the customers on their way with a thank you. That customer got to sweating and feeling impatient; I immediately called my manager over to assist him because of the way he was getting out of character.

good,"The day would start by someone telling or trying to tell a joke and it would just go wrong. I learned something new everyday, it might be a little tip on how to find an address without going through all the steps or how to look for an invoice in a different screen on the computer. Good variety of co-workers. Besides leaving, being out of stock on items. When the alarm would go off so I could go back was enjoyable, I didn't not like not being at work."

I learned how to count and marked boxes for the quarterly inventory. I enjoyed working with all my manager and co-workers. The hardest part of my job was to work grave-yard shift. I enjoyed working at lowe's because I was treated with a lot of respect and love.
good,"I have learned so much over the past 6 years at Lowe's. I started out as a cashier and have worked my way up the ladder. A typical day at Lowe's for me includes audits, scheduling, providing customer service, and monitoring my employees. Our management staff is great! I have developed so many skills from them and continue to grow daily. I couldn't ask for a better group of co-workers to call my Lowe's family. The hardest part of my job is dealing with difficult customers. The most important thing to remember is the customer's feelings. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to build relationships with not only co-workers but also frequent customers."
good,In the morning it is sometimes slow but at times its fast depending on if we are hire and I have to do 1 or more  interviews but I enjoy it I learned how to conduct an interview and what to look for in an applicant. I also enjoy my co-workers and I enjoy helping out customers I am a people person.
good,"Lowes was very interesting. I had to deal with different kinds of people everyday, some were wonderful, and some weren't very pleasant. overall I learned many of things. I learned how to deal with many of things at one time, and how to not panic under pressure."
good,It's a great place to work. Everyone is very nice and management shows appreciation for it's employees.

good,"From 7am- 11am I receive freight, stock, take care of special orders and oversee the production of five stockers/workflow. In the afternoon I focus on hours, payroll and customer delivers for the next day. Never two days are the same so every day is fun but has it's challenging moments."
good,"My job is to clean the store, take out trash and do maintenance work when needed. The Lowe's mangers are very nice and understanding of my goals to better my education. I work on weekends only and have a Saturday morning class. They allow me to leave work and return after my class is over. Also I do my job at my own pace which actually allows me to get done early and help the loaders and the other department associates. Not a day has gone by without another employee thanking me for my hard work which is amazing seeing that I have a job that most people do not want to do. Hardest part of my job is definitely cleaning the toilets. It is not hard but it is gross which in turn makes it hard for me."
good,"Everyone who worked with me, from the store manager on down, was extremely helpful.  Any time I had a question or needed help with something there was always two or three people there willing to help me.  Had some trouble with my asthma while employed there.  They never got upset about me leaving early or having to call in.  They just wanted to know if I needed anything.  Great place to work."
good,"A day at work consisted of interacting with many different people which was my most enjoyable part of the job, as well as my co-workers. I loved working at that store, there was not many negatives about the job. The most difficult about the job was a lot disgruntle customers and high volume work pace, But with experience from other jobs and school I was able to control the situation and make sure the customers left satisfied."
good,"I loved working for Lowe's Home Improvement due to the continuous smell of fresh cut lumber, the smiling customer faces, and the opportunities to help others. When I was doing the beginning mistakes my managerial team was there to help me when I didn't know what to do. I am grateful for them. I even got to run the Seasonal Department for a day and I loved being in control of it. Even though I am short I loved doing my best to help people."

good,"Lowes is a good place to work. The store is always clean, the customers are always cared for, and there's never a dull day. My coworkers are always there for me and have helped me grow every step of the way. The supervisors are friendly and act like real people, unlike many other franchise companies. The store manager is a really friendly guy and will help out in any department of the store when needed. I have to admit that my favorite days are the busiest ones. I hate slow days because there's rarely ever anything productive to do. If the day is slow and there's hundred of boxes to be moved around, then I can actually enjoy it. When there's not much to do in the department I prefer those days where swarms of customers come in at once. I really enjoy helping customers back to back because not only does it make the day go by faster, but it makes the day feel productive. These months that I have been at Lowes have helped me in a few ways; I've improved my people skills, I've developed sales skills, and I've started my career life off on a good note."
good,"Many responsibilities I had the opportunity to supervise other people I leaned so much, mostly how to handle all types of people. The hardest part was all the long hours"

good,"I worked at Lowe's for 6 1/2 years and loved every minute of it. I had a wonderful management staff, especially a certain one, he would answer any question I had and would teach me things I needed to know to advance in the company. I loved helping customers and having the face time on the floor. I really loved it when the customer would bring back pictures of their completed projects. I think the hardest part of my jobs was when I couldn't help a customer get what they wanted due to finances even after I offered them a Lowe's credit card. I would just think back on the conversation to see where I could improve."
good,"Assist customers when they needed help with anything.

I managed 6-10 people a day. I love lowes and every part about it. The advancement is endless. The hardest part of the job was the scheduling and staffing at times. But that didn't phase me.

good,"Lowe's is an absolutely incredible environment to work in. Their values include creating open positive spaces for both employees and customers. I really enjoyed partaking in the initiative to enhance sales and to provide outstanding customer service to ensure returning customers. A typical day as a head cashier would be to assign cashiers to their duties and create the break schedule in the morning.  I would clean the whole front end due to minimal customers between the hours of 6-10 AM. Once I was finished writing the schedule and cleaning, I would create a list of duties for the front end loaders to split amongst themselves for the day. Our rush at the front end would normally begin around 10:15 AM where I would stand on the mat and supervise cashiers and make myself available to assist cashiers and customer service associates. I would answer employee and customer questions, give discounts to customers and help with any technical difficulties. I would be responsible for online orders as well as phone orders and making sure that the front end runs as smoothly as possible. I would assist in loss prevention, by ensuring that big-ticket items have been paid for and deactivated.  I was responsible for managing the front end activities by proactively visiting customer service, returns desk, front line registers, commercial registers, lawn and garden registers, vestibules and parking areas. I would provide direction and support to associates. I would help to ensure customer service needs are met at all times. I was also responsible for responding to all customer and employee generated"
good,"A typical day at work would be taking in the truck and stocking inventory, assisting customers with questions, and loading heavy products into their cars.

The hardest part of that job was remembering where the location of some things were in the store or not knowing the answer to some questions, but would soon figure it out with help from another employee.

good,"Being a front end cashier I really enjoy getting to converse with the customers. Assisting customers with their checkout gives me a small window into their lives. I get to see what kind of projects they like to take on, what materials I may need in the future if interested, or simply what floor cleaner works best.

good,"I quite liked this job. I had a large area of responsibility and a mostly free reign to do my job as I could best do it. During the course of this job I learned how to use numerous machines and store devices my favorite of which was the key cutter in the Hardware dept. I was able to get quite well with most of the management though some members were distant, a necessity of their job I suppose. I got along very well with my co-workers and always resolved my differences in a civilized manner and avoided conflict. When possible I would bring potentially bad situations to the attention of management so that they could take actions to prevent any further work disruption. The hardest part of the job was that the company was often understaffed which put a strain on everyone, myself included. I often felt like I was being pulled in a dozen directions at once with no end or help in sight. The best part of the job was working with employees in different departments and learning new things. I formed several lasting friendships there during that time."

My co-workers were wonderful, we worked hard but had fun too. The hardest part of the job was fighting with insurance companies to get our money that was owed or to get someone approved for therapy. The most enjoyable part of my job was when someone came to therapy for something or another and they walked out that last day feeling like a new person."

good,Lowe's gave me a chance to learn more about operating forklift. I was able to get certified to operate more then four kinds of lift management was excellent. I really enjoyed my co-workers we was like a family. I was blessed to have a chance to work for that company.
good,"A typical day for me at Lowe's was very calming. I worked the 5am to 2pm shift in Lawn and Garden. Even though I was not experienced, they taught me well with their computer tutorials that taught me about the section I was going to work in. The actual manager of the Wasilla, AK location is very down to earth without losing his professionalism. My co-workers were nice but I considered them extremely unprofessional because they took their relationship at work outside of work which made the workplace awkward for those who are not in their ""inner circle."" A lot of drama occurred with the workers because of it. ""She is such a ______."" ""Oh my God, you should of seen how he acted at the party last night."" It was way too personal and I think that is the only negative part about Lowe's because it gave negative energy. The hardest part of the job was dealing with my co-workers but the actual job itself was really pleasant."
good,"Easy, simple work, good people and sometimes fun. Management goes out of their way to help you, no matter the position you would be in."
good,* i make sure im at work 15 min before my scheduled time . first thing i do is check the commercial sales desk for any orders being picked up by customers . if there are orders i get them ready quickly and efficiently . after that i count all the product in my area and make sure the numbers are correct . i continue my day by assisting customers with any help or questions they might need . while also doing tasks that my managers have given me .

My management team is a very caring group of people as well as my co-workers and the hardest part is when people come and steal and you're there in the middle seeing them come in and walk out right in front of you. the most enjoyable part is meeting people.

Ive learned alot about many departments such as electrical, paint, appliances, reciving, Lumber and Cashiering. The management there has helped me understand my job better as well. The only hard part about the job is when an employee has to lift something extreemly heavy but thats the only hard part about that job."

good,I enjoyed working for lowes there was so much to learn. They teach you everything you need to know to be successful in the store. They also teach you how to provide superior customer service to each and every customer.
good,Typical day is very fast paced and different from the prior day. I learned a vast amount of construction skills as well as extensive customer service skills. The mangers at Lowe's are great. Most Managers are very down to earth and understanding as well as informative. Co-workers are very hard working and friendly as well as very easy to get along with. The hardest part of my job at this moment in time is the travelling from ten different store across a given district. Its sort of difficult because i dont live within the district are that I work in. Therefore at times it takes at least an hour to reach certain stores from where I live. The most enjoyable part of my day is the interaction with customers while helping make their shopping experience delightful.
good,I loved working there everyone I worked with was loving and didn't mind lending a hand. During a typical day at work I interacted with over 50 or more customers and co-workers. I loved the fact that I could get to know a lot more people by just working there.
good,Great company to work for. They have good benefits and great pay. Just lack the hours employees need.
good,"I loved working for Lowe's. A typical day was fast paced but laid back, I loved the customers that came in, and the managment was wonderful. I was able to learn alot about tools and how to use them, and how to order building supplies for cummecial customers. My co-workers were really nice and added to the friendly atmosphere, The hardest part of my job was, helping load 50lb concrete bags into customers cars. The part I loved most about working at lowe's was the customers. I love working for them and helping them in any way they needed."
good,I liked that they let me work for them as a cashier i am excited that i got some experince in how to ring a register and all
good,"Lowe's was fun i loved working in the contraction business and then working on the other end of construction like getting contractor their supplies to build. At Lowe's i had to help customers find merchandise in the store, I also cash customers out of the store, if the customers had an item that was to heavy for them to load in their car by them self's I gave them a hand."
good,It is a great place to work if you enjoy helping others and enjoy bosses who not only treat you as equal but are more then willing to help you out in all ways available. Everyone who works there are great people and fun to work with as well.

I learned how to work with money and customers even unruley ones their always right no matter what. management team very good and productive. coworkers nice and helpful . the hardest part was working most weekends . The most enjoyable part was the customers and environment in which i worked.
good,i learned a ton of stuff due to the training progam the people where very friendly like family and the like working with public
good,"I began working at Lowe's Corporate while on a summer break from college. Once school started back I had to leave but was very fortunate enough to still have a job waiting for the next summer. Once I had to take a semester off from school and worked full time hours. When I started back in school I was a part-time student for one semester and only had classes two days a week. Lowe's allowed me those two days off for school. At the store level full time employees were not allowed accomodations for school; therefore, they would have to do school on-line. After graduating college, I began working in the Accounting department full-time. I would report in between 8 and 8:30. I had a list of daily credit card disputes that I had to contact the store and resolve by getting copies of sales receipts, installer contracts, or signed off detail measurements. By doing this research I saved the company money by preventing reimbursement of valid charges to a customer's credit card. Sometimes I would have to fax electronic images of a sales receipt to a store upon request. I learned a lot about credit card disputes. There were seven workers in my department. We all got along extremely well. While working in the Accounting department I was experiencing a difficult moment in my life. My department went above and beyond to help me get through it all. I often had to miss work due to this personal incident. I was allowed to make up my hours on Saturdays. My co-workers were always willing to help each other. Management was definitely the most understanding individuals I have ever met. My job was easy;"
good,Great pay for the area. you will definatly earn you pay though.
good,"I enjoyed working for Lowes as the management was highly educated, approachable and informative, co-workers were friendly and helpful, great teamwork environment and high energy atmosphere. The hardest part of my job was correcting special order sales when they would get returned by the customer for incorrect specification sent by the manufacturer. The most enjoyable part of my job was customer interaction and the actual job functions."
good,I can see myself in the near future employed with a well known and respected company.
good,easy work good company decent pay i worked there for seasonal job and had no problems great ppl to work with overall a fun job
good,I loved Lowe's
good,Everyday was always something new and exciting. I learned everything there is about cashiering from Lowes. I loved my co-workers. We always worked really hard helping our customers while still enjoying out job. My favorite time working at lowes was during the summer in outside lawn and garden. I enjoyed my job very much there. My job was not hard at all. I knew everyday what I had to do and did my very best to help every customer that walked through the door.
good,"I enjoyed working with this company every day. There is constant interaction with customers and management, and with the product knowledge and training they give you, it really makes you feel good when you can help someone with there project from start to finish."
good,It is a very pleasant place to work. They promote from within and take pride in the job. The management is there if there is any issues or problems.
good,A typical day at work is being on time and setting up the machines.
good,lowe's gave me the skills to give great customer service and showed me that I could make my life better and that I had a mind and the strength to over come my bad stuff. thank Lowe's you are the best
good,"At 9pm The Freight Crew (Recievers & Stockers) recieve the trucks which range around 3-5 depending on how busy it is. Shipment goes on pallets according to each department. Then each pallet is put in the dprtmt it belongs to. The stocker replenishes the sales fl. If the sales fl is full all shipment becomes top stock. Top stock is put on shelves from 8 ft to 12ft. high which is why stockers must be certified in Order pickers and other associated machinery. I worked in the paint drtment which to my preference was quite easy. On most nights I would finish my duties quicker then other dprmnts. Hardware and Electrical are neighbors to my dprtmt. These dprtmts have many small items that have to be put individually on shelves which is time consuming. Lowes encourages their employees to work as a team to get the overall job done before 6am so if one person was still working, we were not done. I liked that about Lowes. Management plays a big role in functions of all positions. My co-workers were more like family as time past. The hardest part of the job was adjusting to the night/day switch because I have two children. When I should've been sleeping during the day, I wasn't. I enjoyed getting my work done in paint first and helping Hardware."
good,I work as thou I were working for the Lord and that pleases every employer I've ever had.
good,Great place to work and use of modern technology to provide excellent customer service.
good,I enjoyed using my skills for this company.Lowe's is a great company to work for.
good,"Most of my coworkers are awesome. Every one is most of the time eager to help, and learn new skills. The management team is always there for you, and is open to new ideas. If you're currently a student, they will normally work with your schedule ( unless its every weekend). Overall great company."
good,lowes is a very good job to work at ....I recommend this job to anyone who is willing to join their team....
good,"A typical day at work at Lowes was very easy going and casual. I would walk in, wave hello to everyone, head to the break room, put my lunch away and maybe stop and chat with coworkers. I go out onto the floor in my vest, punch in and start my shift. As with all retail jobs, customer service was the name of the game. This created a great friendly atmosphere at Lowe's, where everyone had a good time. The management was great at Lowes. They were very supportive and understanding, and made me feel like I was part of the Lowe's family from the very start. I was able to learn many things in my short time at Lowes, including from computer skills, to customer service skills, and most of all, I learned about human relations. The job was generally easy. I'd say the most difficult part of the actual work was learning to use the janky computer system. From a day in day out perspective, the only difficult part of the job was working during the rush hour. At times the store can be understaffed, and it makes it quite stressful to deal with long lines of customers. But luckily my wonderful coworkers always made the end of the day a good time. I would say they were the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"a typical day at work wa getting my job done. i learned how to drive a forklift, load and unload trucks. management was great. my co-workers was team players. i enjoyed my job."
good,"This Company gives you the tools to make whatever you want of the position you obtain and grow at whatever pace you desire. Management was very receptive to new ideas and worked with you to acquire desired goals. If you just want to be a cashier, then that is ok, if you want to grow with them and demonstrate the desire, they will help you achieve those goals."
good,"there is nothing bad to say about Lowe's. I absolutely loved my job there. They worked with my school schedule, taught me alot, and they were fair (not biased or favored anyone over the next) the only reason for leaving lowes, was because i needed to make more money for my family. However if i made a higher pay at lowes, I would work there until I graduated"
good,I loved coming in helping customers with difficult tasks and situations.
good,Enjoyable work days with great people. Each day brings new challenges as well as interesting people.
good,"experienced different customer everyday but stillmanage to make them happy at the end of the call or sale, management is great but becould be alittle better, coworker are great just feel that some can do and learn waymore than what they know know but alot of co workers look up to me as a gudiance. No hardest part and everyday is enjoyable for me."
good,Lowe's is a good company to work for
good,Enjoyed working at Lowe's
good,Lowe’s is one of the best company’s I’ve ever work for being that when I clock in it feels like I’m at home not a place of employment. It is a very family oriented place of employment. They care about you and make sure you know it.

good,I loved working at Lowes. Everyone was so much fun and it was always a blast.
good,Lowes was a different kind of job i had taught me how to speak up and also how to enjoy life and the company that you keep around you. They had showed me that people everywhere in the world is truely different and to accept them for who they are
good,"productive , active and fun in workplace"
good,"Great Job , very product workers and fun people."
good,I worked in the Hardware department in the store. I was responsible in keeping my department presentable at all times and help all customers in what ever they need with in the department or anywhere in the store. I answered phone calls for my department when needed. I ordered merchandise for the customer if need. I also worked the cashier when needed. Co-workers were friendly the managers were fare. The job was fun fast passed which made the time fly.
good,"help customers at the customer service/ return desk, make sure the customers are happy and satisfied with their product, i also help stocking"
good,cashier working with great customer and co-workers and management team.
good,Rotating schedule
good,A lot of hard work but all enjoyable. Work the forklift help customer load lumber and cement.
good,Every day I went to work with a smile ready and willing to work with the customers. I learned that customers are always right even though you know that sometimes they are not. Employees have to keep the customers happy in order for them to return back to the store. Everything done in the store was team work. Each employer worked together to get the job done and in a timely manner. The hardest job is the return desk. Receiving the customer focus award twice was the most enjoyable part of my job....
good,Down loading and stocking shelves. Teaching home improvement classes to customers. Putting away New freight that we have received. Most important helping customers with there needs. Co-workers are easily motivated as we worked together to get the job done.
good,"customers are great, management is great, they always help you out no matter the situation. co-works are friendly and help when ever needed"
good,Work was fun. My co-workers where all nice and they greeted everyone at the door. Everything was always in order. Our number one thing was to make the customers happy. Lowes was very big on Customer Service. There were no really hard parts of the job. My coworkers help me out a lot during my beginning days. This helped me get the hang of things. I enjoyed every part of my job.
good,"A typical day at work consists of reviewing the Order Management Screen to resolve issues, open/manage credit accounts including Lowe's Consumer Card, Lowe's Business Account, Lowe's American Express and Lowe's Account Receivable. Explain account terms to customer,process various transactions including check, credit/debit cards and cash quickly and accurately. I learned to ALWAYS take care of each customer like a member of the family and make sure he/she walks out with an excellent customer service experience. Management members are competent and listen to concerns/opinions, co-workers are all pleasant and hard working. The hardest part of my job is probably not being able to give the customer the best possible experience and the most enjoyable part is interacting with my customers!"
good,I worked there part time while attending college at Ferris State University. I mostly worked in the paint department mixing paint and putting away stock. The workers were very friendly and the management was very flexible for my class schedule.
good,"Lowe's is a very nice company to work for because it is always allowing you to learn new aspects of the business. I like to be challenged in many ways. I have learned much at my present employer. I have learned from my store manager that you manage personalities as a manager. Everyone is different and you need to recognize this in your employees. The hardest part of the job would be the previous statement about the different employee's personalities. However, I have learned this is very attainable with patience and knowledge. I love working and servicing people. I have an outgoing personality and love to talk and listen to people."
good,Loved working at lowe's. Great company to moved up in too bigger and better things. Enjoyed working with and being around the customers. Learned great management skills and how to deal with customers and their problems better.
good,Lowes was a great company to work for. they would give free lunches to the employees. management was helpful in solutions
good,"not the typical work for me, when I have a clerical background. Lowes has great benefits. If i were to ever get another job the onl thing i would miss is my co-workers."
good,"Lowe's is one of the best company's that I have worked for. Their benefits and rate of pay are substantially better than most company's. Pay is based on skills, knowledge, and previous related work experience. A typical day of work, depending what department you are stationed involves daily and weekly inventory, zoning, and providing the best customer service. Previously to working for Lowe's, I had no home repair experience nor any knowledge of tools and hardware. While working with Lowe's, I gained extensive knowledge about all the departments and finally became a supervisor. The hardest part of the job was learning to balance customer service and daily/weekly inventory work sheet dealines. However, the challenge is temporary. The most enjoyable part of the job is that everyday is different. The tasks maybe the same, but the day will never be the same as the day before."
good,"Excellent work environment,great benefits and pay, exceptional management."
good,"Sale,smile and having fun at it. Nice team to work with, no matter how hard the job was we did it with a smile."
good,"A typical day at lowes usually started stocking and preparing department for the day, and a morning meeting that gets everyone on the same page about sales and customer issues. Lowes offered many different training sessions for safety, health and handing the work environment. Lowes has many different layers of management. The hardest part of the job was that things were always changing, sometimes on a daily basis. Sometimes the changes were good and sometime difficult. My co-workers are the most enjoyable part of the job. Most started at the same time when the store opened and we all got pretty close."
good,"I have enjoyed my time with Lowe's. Great company to work for, wonderful group of people."

good,Ride around via Walkie and optained specific items to ship to specific destinations. Managament is cool and works well with the employees. Co- Workers all got along. Nothing really hard about the job.
good,The North Canton store is a customer focused store. Employees strive to make sure product is in the store for customers. If not they will if all possible order the product for you. Employees are a close knit community and help each other strive to make customers shopping experience the best it can be. The hardest part of the job is making sure the product gets put on the shelf as fast as it can in a busy shopping environment. Management makes sure the store looks great everyday with the help of the store associates.
good,"Assisting customers, stocking, cashier. I enjoyed working for Lowes. I learned something new everyday. The hardest part was not knowing what some tools were but like I said it was all a learning process."
good,Excellent work environment where you feel more like family than co workers.

Checking the IRP's on a daily basis. IRP's is a sheet of paper showing that we have an item in stock but it's not in the hole where it's supposed to be so we have to find it, whether that's to down stock it or look around to make sure it's not behind another item or misplaced. I learned to deal with customers the proper way and to help anyone I see. Also I learned that the more respect and kindness you give to customers the more they'll want to come back and buy from you. A lot of times people come into the store looking for that one Employee that helped them because they then know they will get what they need and be satisfied. Management was excellent and helped you out when you had a question about something. It could be anything and they have the answer for it. The managers often helped during after hours stock the shelves and help bring in product from outside using the forklift to make our job easier and to get out of the store and go home faster.
