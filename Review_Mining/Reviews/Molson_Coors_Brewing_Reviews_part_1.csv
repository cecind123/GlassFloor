rating,review
bad,"Don't waste your time, they state $34.17/hr. but after you contribute to your good union pension you really only make $27.77/hr. The health, dental and vision insurance is complete garbage, extremely high deductible and out of pocket costs. Practically nothing for a shift premium, I personally would not recommend this place to anyone, its been horrible for over 10 years!"
bad,"New CEO has no clue how to run a business, go back to crunching numbers and let someone with the last name Coors take over. What moron takes an iconic Colorado brand and up roots to Milwaukee? Good luck surviving. Budweiser will end Coors sooner than later."
bad,I worked hard and deserve to be full time employee. Somehow they hire new trainee to become full time employee over me. Upset with their decision.  Many good employees were upset with hire and prefer me over them. I moved on and decide not to come back again for another 3 years contract term.
bad,They take advantage of the temps and once your time is over no matter how high your numbers are they let you go and then call you back in couple months . No change for opportunities to grow.
bad,They put people in management in certain department with no experience. It should be mandatory to know what the job actually is before assigning new management to represent a department like heavy equipment if they came from the packaging department. Money was good split shift was horrible and numbers are going down in sales probably a matter of time until most plants shut doors.
bad,This place sucks. The people suck. Everyone and everything suck. Don’t ever work here. I am ashamed to be an employee here. If I knew then what I know now I’d never apply
bad,"This place is for you if you like doing a job for half the price of you co-worker , no insurance, paying union dues and getting no representation, told you are just a temp your opinion doesn't matter, management is so horrible they put you in dangerous situations everyday and don't care.  They have unfair hiring practices . Racism is crazy because of management.  All in all this place is terrible for your life and well being."
bad,"This company can do better. the work is bad, like i said before. What you going to do about this. I needed a job. I going to take this step up. I have all the fact about this company."
bad,not interested in trash talking companies. The culture here is cut throat and the company doesn't care for its employee's at all. You are way under payed and work in old terrible conditions.
bad,Would tell employees not to call in to work until your shift had started. There was NO way to get on with company full time. They only use contract worker. And don't me to work overtime 10 minutes prior to end of shift.
bad,If you are a Vet don't even bother trying to get hired on. they are no longer Vet friendly. they used to be in the past when they were strictly Coors. I'll never buy a miller/coors product again.
bad,Union work with management I they don't like u they get u fired and management harassment If I have no family there the don't respect you
bad,Horrible management with absolutly no morals or ethics especially in the treatment of contractors.
bad,"I can’t find a single employee in R&D who’s happy. For how important our job is to the company we’re getting paid less then brewery workers. Our project load has increased at least 5X in the past 2 years with no salary increase or additions to staff. Our manager is gone for sometimes a solid month for work trips, we have no maintenance team, our software is ancient, there’s no preventative maintenance program, no safety training, and no access to basic supplies, they took our lab staff away, and we don’t have meetings to talk about improvements because we have no time or money and no one cares. Also it is an overly corporate bro-culture so harassment is EVERYWHERE and we can’t report it. I took a 30% pay reduction getting “promoted” and moved to Milwaukee from Colorado to work in R&D to see how the best-of-the-best innovate. Now I see we’re the worst-of-the-worst trying to compete with the best-of-the-best."
bad,"I thought working for Coors would be a great opportunity and a job that i could retire at. Man, was i ever mistaken.  I was a second shift forklift operator as a temp to hire, so of course I'm at the bottom of the seniority list. That is not a place on the list that you want to be. Working 12 hour shifts until your contact is up and then they let you go."
bad,Poor working conditions.. No work life balance. Company does not care about there employees. Company tries to brain wash there employees that they are broke when they make billions in clear profit every year. Craft employees dont get to do there job. They are used for relief operators.
bad,"the worst company culture I have ever experienced, the F bomb is dropped every other sentence by upper management and disorganization is the norm."
bad,The only part about this company that I like is the pay for employment. I don't find management is helpful for advancement and the HR dept is lagging integrity.
bad,Money is good but not worth all you had to loose to get it. Company doesn't really care about there peope. The people are cut throats. HR department is poor.
bad,Your wasteing your time if you go in as temp because they will tell you that you gonna get fulltime when that time comes its bullcrap. They dont care about your lifestyle at home. You work messed up schedule.  Some of the teams are ok and some you cant get along with.  The company went down hill when different managment took over not worth working here with all the drama
bad,Had no training or support for the job I held! This was the worst job of my career.
bad,MillerCoors isn't the place for young talent due to their lack of development. The organizational structure is also terrible due to the very few positions or possibilities for advancement within the company. Prepare to work at least 5-10 years before advancement.
bad,"Sinking ship.....What more can be said for big beer?"
bad,"I worked for Miller as it became MillerCoors.  The company culture was great, collaborative, and energizing.  I learned so much.  I had to leave MillerCoors due to my spouse's job transfer.  I was able to rejoin MillerCoors several years later.  The company culture had changed so much--and not for the better.  My new manager was a micro-manager extraordinaire. His total approach was a CYA approach. The job market within the company had become so cut-throat that the only interest was in protecting his job.  The project documentation had quadrupled in number of documents.  Most were just repetitive copies of each other and provided no added value.  When my department was merged into the MolsonCoors business unit, the transition was handled so poorly that I knew there was no way to continue to successfully work for the company."
bad,Disappointed in management: poor communication and lack of decision making. Multiple layers of management but replacing lower level support positions with contingent workers.
bad,"The money is good but that is as far as it goes. The HR department absolutely hates employees."
bad,"If you’re craft and expect to work on stuff don’t come here because you’ll be operating equipment "
bad,"Owned by Molson Coors, Miller Coors, is the US division.  They are being asked to be part of the global enterprise, but act arrogant, and ignore global... they need new thinking at the top and to infuse more external thinking into their old boy's mindset!"
bad,"the work day was not bad,but the management was. hardest part of the job was putting up with the racist environment . the pay is the only good thing there."
bad,"MillerCoors is one of the highest paying manufacturing jobs in SWGA. I have been employed here for a very long time. I do not approve of the hiring process, especially in Supply Chain. I started off working here in another department, and transferred to Supply Chain. I can honestly say that I am disgusted in the hiring process. There are some quick learning, highly skilled, and motivated temporary employees here that are being treated like scum. They come in during the season with the best intentions and soon find out that there chances of being hired are slim to none. They lose all motivation. Favoritism is the name of the game, and if you are a Temp ""WELCOME TO HELLONEARTH"""
bad,Cheap company that wants to use temps and hire no one . Train people just to drop them. Workers are helpful management stinks.
bad,Literally had 6+ hrs per day in meetings. Then expected to supervise production and maintenance personnel and plan maintenance activities and acquire material for maintenance. This forced 20-30 days consecutive without a day off 12-16 hrs per day as a salaried employee. A moderate hourly rate was paid in 4 hr blocks on Saturdays and Sundays only.
bad,"This is not a job for the faint of heart. However, it is a job that if you are one of those who enjoy pointing fingers and rubbing the bosses back you will get somewhere faster than the others. "
bad,"Corporation is poorly managed, and micromanaged.  No work life balance.  There are never any straight forward answers, everything is very secretive.  Not allowed to do just the job your assigned to, expected to cover other areas as well."
bad,"I enjoyed my job  the production employees are honest and  easy to work with,  I learned to work on various HRIS systems,. The hardest part of the job is Management."
bad,"I would not recommend this company.  Although the perks are great with a lot of travel and meetings, etc. They are really difficult to work with and have watched many of my coworkers struggle with them as well."
bad,"I worked with the company for many years and at many different levels. I've worked both in MillerCoors corporate structure and within the Brewery. I honestly feel like I've lost many years of my life at a company that doesn't appreciate the hard work that it's employees give every day. The company is currently going through a reorganization in which middle-management is being fazed out. This has lead to tension/distrust by the floor employees, job security/feeling unwanted issues for the middle management, and over worked/beaten down for upper management. These are just a few of the many items out there. I strongly suggest speaking with someone that works with the company prior to applying...right now might not be the most opportune time."
bad,"work day was good if you could get the management to keep there hands off your schedule, didn't learn anything because they are to cheap to send you to classes for your job. management is terrible they are only looking out for themselves and trying to move up the ladder with there great ideas. I would say the hardest part of the job is trying to keep your sanity after management messes with your schedule and moves you to another department with out warning."
bad,"My first food service job"
bad,"The company that used to pride itself on being a solid employer in the local economy has sold out. Now they contract everything in the name of profit. Adolf Coors, no doubt, is turning in his grave."
bad,"Typical day 10+ hours Mon-Fri, Workload requires consistent weekend work, On-call 24-7. Culture is counter productive as goals are not aligned within departments and coordination between departments doesn't exist. Compensation did not meet workload. Hardest part of job was to find uninterrupted family time. Pay was good at first but no substantial raises for increased work load."
bad,"I worked here as a temporary worker for less than 3 months and of course I was the only deaf person on the 7 bottle line while everyone else was hearing (which this sets me up for failure).  The first rule the grave yard shift told me was to NEVER tell the manager that they are abusing their privileges by taking 2 hour breaks.  Which means this goes against my very religious beliefs as a good christian man that I'm trying to be so I just kept my mouth shut.  The employees who only worked 6 hour shifts but get paid for 8 because they work so ""hard"" started to complain when they were working 2 nights a week.  I never saw anyone participating in the extra hour rework or asking any other bottle line if they needed help for more hours or be willing to stay longer anytime a manager asked them to.  I wanted to be transferred to the other lines with the other deaf employees so I would be better accommodated but they wouldn't allow me to.  The shift leader I worked for his behavior was disgusting in a way that no matter how many times I told him I can read his lips, he had to mimic sign language waving his hands around his mouth as if he actually knew sign language.  I was treated disrespectfully, lowly as if I'm nothing, and didn't practice communication like they preached.  When it came time to clean the machines, no one on the 7 bottle line, not even the safety manager, practiced LOTOTO, which I thought was a joke because that's we learned going into this since DAY ONE!!!  These people made up lies about me to get me gone because they are not team players so they got what they wanted."
bad,"Lots of back stabbers - Its all about the money !   Employees often would threatened each other over OT and job assignments . Worked there 35 yrs = retired . No more pension -   No post employment health insurance -  No sick days -  Union signed a contract with Company while I was there Quote ""  Not withstanding any provision of the contract the company can add, subtract , combine eliminate, transfer ""    Teamster  brewery much stronger Union  ."
bad,"Une journée de travail typique consistait à faire le remplissage des cuves, vérifier le taux de CO2, prendre des échantillons, faire différents tests, acheminer les échantillons au laboratoire, entrer les données à l'ordinateur et être alerte à tout incident éventuel. "
bad,"Quality Lab has a horrible dynamic, they have clear favorites and are very understaffed. They have poor management and would fail without their constant rotation on temp staff. If you want to remain in good terms be prepared to be overworked and keep your opinions to yourself, seniority is a problem here."
bad,"A typical day at work at coors involved an utter lack of any direction given to anyone in the morning. Then a lot of yelling over the phone at each other in the evening over who didn't finish what for which store. I feel as though that is where the majority of the hours for this job originate. No one knows what to do for the day and essentially end up making up for it in the evening. I was ridiculed and degraded to no end by my boss. I forgot to wear a matching belt one day to work and it didn't just get pointed out, I got torched. My boss literally told me ""I better not see you ever wearing that ____ing belt again"". That was the day I quit I refused to work in an environment in which my superior felt entitled enough to curse at me for a belt."
bad,millercoors no life lots of over time no advancement good pay long hours no weekend off bad for your health plant closing
bad,"I learned a lot at millercoors. Very interesting facts but a lot to take on. The management was poor, it was unorganized and could have been run a lot differently and would have been a good place to work."
bad,"You felt like a Fireman with all the fires you had to put out due to poor communication, constantly running from store to store"
bad,It was a fun environment but in sales you are expected to be on call and attached to your phone all the time even during vacation you have requested off. Unrealistic goals to hit and the constant fear of not making enough money.
bad,There is zero time spent building and developing individuals.  You are expected to be best in class on your first day of a new job.  If you fall short they will fire you.
bad,"Underappreciated, little room for advancement despite the initiative and effort to do so, not to mention the false promise of advancement. It's a good job for a paycheck and not much else. Everyone who works there is tired and unmotivated to do anything else and seeking a different job."
bad,I was a temp at the Trenton facility. The management is out of touch and very bad at communication/understanding. They purposefully understaff the lab to barebones levels. The work in the micro lab as a temp is overwhelming. 10 to 12 hour days are pretty common here. Forced overtime every third weekend (Sat and Sun). It feels as if management sets you up to fail... However I really learned a lot from my experience. My coworkers in the lab were wonderful and they made the job worth it. This was my first job out of college so I am grateful for the experience but I wouldn't recommend staying here longer than six months.
bad,"It's an oppressive and hostile work environment and if you are salaried, and work in production, you are at the mercy of the union which is king. The pay for this area is great but that is it's only redeeming quality."
bad,"I was hired as a tour guide but ended up spending most of the time busing tables, washing dishes and checking people in for the tour.  They want you to work five days a week but only for 4-6 hours per day, so it is basically a full time job with part time pay.  Pay is just above minimum wage, so you can't live on it and it's hard to get a second job when working 5 days a week.  Inflexible management.  Constant turnover of staff."
bad,"Lack of Work/Life Balance; Lack of Leadership; Pass the buck mentality; For such a large company, one would think the benefits would be amazing. Health Insurance benefits are HORRIBLE!"
bad,Overall company was great back when i started in 2005 with Miller Brewing Company and in 2008 when Miller Brewing Company and Coors Brewing Company merged to become Millercoors the annual restructuring started with no job security.
bad,"This job is has very low morale, the pay is not enough, and the management is terrible. They expect you to do so much for so little. The pay is salary base so you will only be paid for 8 hours a day. But often you will be working 10 to 12 hours daily. You do receive and incentive pay, but it’s only 300 dollars once a month and you can’t receive that if you miss a day or late for work more than twice in a months time."
bad,A typical day at work was sweeping the grain up from the floor. The workplace culture was mainly English. The hardest part of the job was climbing the stairs.
bad,"Covered S La beer distributors.  Build volume, distribution and local chain plans. Managed $1K budget for local events, incentives and marketing. Managed inventory levels within the distributors."
bad,Union environment engaged in daily operations and focused on future company growth.  Highly focused on Safety of the environment and the employee.  Quality focused
bad,Management was never honest about anything going on in the company. Working in the warehouse was awesome but the pay and hours are terrible. Makes it hard to have a social life outside of work.
bad,"MillerCoors just didn't value the position in guest services. They offer you full time, but you only work 33 hours a week at $12/hour.  Who can pay rent with that much? The management doesn't want to andance you help you develop so that you can earn more, they just keep training you with more responsibility and not an increase in pay.  I have seen more than a 60% turn over."
bad,"load trucks with pallets of beer, thats all you do. You have a order in front of you and you pick the beer and out it in the truck. You must be quick to aim the forks"
bad,"Poor management, lack of guidance.  Role changes without reason. Placing personnel in positions without training or guidance."
bad,"MillerCoors is an OK place to work overall. There is a lot of turnover due to long hours and no compensation.  At the local level, there are a lot of transitions going on due to being purchased by MolsonCoors."
bad,Benefits are decent. Not able to plan weekends in advance because you may be forced to work.  Employees are sometimes punished under the point system when other employees fail to work their shift.
bad,"I worked in MC Guest Relations for a number of months. The management was terrible. There was quite a bit nepotism. If your family hadn't work there for generations, forget it. Little chance for advancement. The company is arrogant - basically they think ""We are Coors.... you should be happy working for us"". High turnover rate.I moved on very quickly."
bad,Security Department outsourced.  Would  rather not comment.
bad,"Enjoyed the beer business and getting to meet people from all over the world. Poor management, low pay, and unfair treatment to individual employees drove me away. Manager showed extreme favoritism to certain few employees and was disrespectful and unprofessional to others. Manager went to HR multiple times due to harassment but yet no consequences were made. Assistant manager was actually PROMOTED to Store Manager.... basically rewarded for unprofessional, horrible behavior."
bad,Simply put nobody can work these hours. Your body never can adjust to these crazy hours.I tried for two months and only caused grief with wife and family..Please make sure you understand hours before you apply also had to wear ear plugs and ear headphones to silence the non stop noise of pounding machinery.Also money is not everything more important to be happy and having your sanity.
bad,"MillerCoors pays hourly and salary employees well.  The company fails at promoting high performing talent within the company.  Unfortunately, exceptional workers leave and the complacent workers stay.  Complacent workers stay because they cannot last a week with other companies."
bad,"A year ago it was a good place to work.  Decent work life balance, nice people to work with, if you were stressed you could go to your manager for help.  Now it's quite the opposite.  50+ hours per week is standard and not enough to complete the work load.  The best part is the people. Lots of smart, hardworking, dedicated people.... but many are all looking to get out and get out fast."
bad,Senior and local leadership have been extremely slow to change to account for a declining market.  Culture in the brewery is archaic at best with a very entrenched hourly workforce that management does not challenge and a very immature front line leadership.
bad,Great paying job but had to sacrifice time with your children for that type of money. You had the opportunity to easily make 100k a year. I learned quickly money isn't everything
bad,"They now hire recent college graduates, and decide that these new, inexperienced people  know more than 20, 30, 40 year veteran employees. With no understanding of how the plant works, these managers make stupid decisions that  negatively  effect production, work life balance, quality of product, and management  employee relationships.  The human resources department is useless.  Company  policies now all say that any policy can be changed or interpreted by any manager at any time for any reason. Company policies are supposed to set a standard to which everyone, including  managers, are held to.  No longer true at MillerCoors.  Much easier to  rule by fear than show leadership. Good luck."
bad,US beer industry is challenging and MillerCoors is most impacted due to reliance on 2 major light brands that are struggling. Environment and mood low -similar to the stock price down 40% in last year
bad,"After being there for several years, it is time to look beyond the company for career advancement.  I have been pigeon-holed by my current department."
bad,"Temporary workers only making half pay with no benefits, "
bad,"My experience wasn't great.  I don't think it's a reflection of the company overall, just the site I worked at had really bad management and leadership."
bad,"Don't waste your time, culture of trust does not exist. Your boss will be fresh out of college with no experience, and your 15+ years of knowledge of the place will be ignored. Used to be a fine place to work where people had fun and loved their jobs. Not anymore, if you like working the whole summer with maybe a day off a week, on one days notice, work in production."
bad,"Only work here if you need something while you're considering other options. The only room for advancement is if a coordinator or supervisor moves on - and don't count on that anytime soon, or if you're looking into sales for MillerCoors. The SMP program is actually pretty cool, but you will have to be relocated for a year or two, so there's that too."
bad,no communication at all from management they want to stick you on a job with little training then when you miss up they want to write you up for it... pay and benefits are great and also paid time
bad,The culture was diverse which was great.   There was however a huge turnaround in staff and management.  Senior Assistants were underappreciated.      There was a feeling on non-inclusion.
bad,"Great people to work with but not to work for. If you need to learn something, you better teach yourself (every single time). Very political in the Finance group - you are a pawn."
bad,Company is in a big transition.  They lack accountability and organization.  They have many silos throughout the location and none of them work together.
bad,This company is good for entry level employees. As you progress in your career it would be best to look at other CPG companies where your skills can easily transfer.
good,Management was determined by how well you knew certain people.  Hard company for a female to advance upwards at least in the Finance/Accounting departments.  Environment may be different now that they have merged with Coors.
good,willing to invest in new equipment and train employees on how to operate equipment.
good,"When you work in the brewery you will work 40 hours and you will work every Saturday (even if you don't sign up you will be forced to work). There is no advancement available many of the people there have been there for 40 years and in the same positions. Being part of the union does nothing for you, but demand you pay union dues. The pay is actually good when you get hired on full time, which is nice if you have a family and need to support them. If you are someone who wants to have weekends don't plan on working here because you will not get on 1st shift unless you have been there for 40+ years. You will get plenty of free beer and discounted beer which is nice."
good,Productive keeps you busy. Management can listen to you better. Co-workers could of had more RESPECT for others and got along.
good,"Brewery Maint. Tech"
good,"This job pays less than most fast food places do nowadays, but hey at least you get a lot of free beer to help you forget that you make less than the guy flipping burgers at McDonald's."
good,The company talked about work life balance but they didn't pracitice it.  People weren't treated equally of fairly.  Questions weren't asked when they needed to be.
good,"Fun place to work - you're making beer! But management was terrible and there was gross favoritism and a severe lack of compassion for most employees. It was common to work 30 or more days in a row, many of which were 12 hour shifts. Understaffed and lack of receptive management made it a stressful environment. Very good pay and plenty of beer tho."
good,management made alot nof bad decisions that hourly had to make work or took blame for and it was alot of drama and cut throat place to work for with hourlys very tired from working 7 dfays a week 12 hours a day to doing alot of work for other empoyees not ding there part.
good,Good place to start your beverage/CPG career.  Will build up your sales and marketing muscle.
good,Management wasn't involved when they should have been. The schedule was really hard to get used to and made for poor sleep. Complaints when ignored because of the infrastructure of management.
good,"Solid bosses and teamwork.  Support staff was good, but key managers drove wedges between on and off sales, chain versus operations.  Senior management and unsuccessful, new brand rollouts have hurt the spirit and brand."
good,"You have very long days during the busy season from January through March, and taking vacation can be difficult since they are continuously understaffed to complete workload in reasonable time."
good,"dis organized, management has no respect for hourly, no chance for advancement, cant trust the people I work with, senor employees use seniority as a bully tool , no training on news systems or up dated training in new equipment."
good,"Great management in the upper-management level.  questionable in the lower levels of management.  they take care of their people with flex time ~40 hour; however, if you actually see that time off you are lucky!"
good,"Great people to work with, but everyone is constantly moving so there is minimal deep knowledge in departments"
good,Interesting and challenging work as a marketer but culture and marketing vision needs to be improved at the moment. Good way to learn brand management but hard to move up in company as an Associate.
good,"Outside in its hard to imagine how to make the beer business feel the same as any other commodity, but MillerCoors does manage to boil everything down to case volume.  It makes job satisfaction challenging. The old school Hierarchy is alive and well at MillerCoors and there is a healthy emphasis on relocation being the prerequisite for upward mobility."
good,"Great benefits, and pay. However, the culture is lack luster, and work life balance for hourly employees is almost non-existent. Training is mismanaged, development is haphazard and follow through is lacking."
good,"I've been here for 13 years.  When I started the company was still owned by the Coors family.  The subsequent incorporation and merger with first Molson, then Miller, and now some combo of the two have taken their toll."
good,"Beer industry can be fun, but MillerCoors has so many metrics and that want you to hit, it's a challenge to keep it fun and not be stressed out all the time to deliver, in a declining sales environment. Need to narrow the focus for day to day deliverables."
good,management not organized and head engineer was a joke.  Said enough. !!!!   Good fellow workers for most part .  lot of hiring was friends of friends so you had to be careful.
good,"Our day we would  build new or replace piping system in the brewery , removing obsolete  equipment  to install new . All the while production is producing product . One of the most challenging parts of the job was closing off areas for safe working environments and bringing in and out material safely was always a challenge. There where sum of the most talented dedicated people I have ever worked with."
good,You can write your own check at Millercoors. You're able to work a ridiculous amount of hours. Its a union shop. Pros and cons with that. Lazy people are protected. A lot of people there do just enough not to get fired....it can be extremely frustrating.
good,"welded pipe and ran machinery , hard work , dirty conditions and alot of overtime and hard for family life"
good,"Great training, very formal and constant.  High pay. Unrealistic expectations and management can be difficult to work with, but other management below regional level is very supportive and want the best for you."
good,"Beer is certainly a fun and engaging category, but MillerCoors is far behind its competitors in terms of innovative and strategic thinking.  Its leadership ignores the company's many disadvantages and displaces blame for company performance.  The dynamic nature of the category make it a fine place to start out or to wayside for a year or two, but do not look to build a career here."
good,Good company to gain experience and expand your skill sets.  MillerCoors takes its training very seriously and always has a new initiative you will be challenged to meet.
good,work is good and people but the benefits are bad. while employed continued to change operation management 
good,"Pay is decent- downside is mandatory overtime in the summer months."
good,"The beer category is not growing, and MillerCoors results aren't great either.  As a result, we were always asked to do more with less, which made it very stressful."
good,"There's layers upon layers of mold built up for generations in the labyrinth of cellars."
good,"A lot of politics within management"
good,"Good company, good benefits, fair salary with an spectacular training and development program.  Unfortunately, in the region I was working promotions were not based on merit, it was more on cronyism and hidden nepotism which have caused sales and performance to decline and a big portion of the talent to leave."
good,"Lack of competencies by upper management is a hindrance for any employee at MillerCoors. No work/life balance, HORRIBLE health insurance and unwillingness to promote women through out the plant."
good,"Miller Coors is a typical manufacturing plant, only it produces beer.  Safety is of the utmost importance at all times.  Employees must be focused on their job in order to be safe."
good,Company was just bought out by Molson Coors. Layoffs are a reality as both companies are merging. Not a safe place to work as the domestic beer business and losing a lot of field to the craft beers.
good,"The company is good, it gives lot of employee compensations. Pay is good but could be more as compare to amount of the work people have to do. Job work and life balance should be little better. Need more job security for the temporary worker"
good,"Nice pay, good benefits and perks. No work life balance at all. Force overtime almost every week. Management is nowhere to be found because of all of the job cuts made. Union is weak"
good,Miller created hostal enviroment in former coors plant. Hard work lot of learnig to do in coors plant.  Wary complicated machinery custom made. Liquefiers/ air system /co2/ amonia/ steam. Cooling water system. Lot of fun betwen co workers.
good,MillerCoors spends a lot of time spinning their wheels. They are not able to implement successful change because of the culture of the company.
good,Management can be up and down. Lots of changes since the merger with Miller. Still a good place to work
good,"My typical day at work was very structured. As a Distributor Sales Manager, there are countless hours dedicated to analyzing business trends, monitoring product inventory, and executing sales strategies. My favorite part of the job was the people on my team. Everyone played a crucial role for success, and I was able to participate in every aspect of the business."
good,"Information is from years ago - it would not be relevant to anyone seeking or considering employment with this company today. Therefore, your surveys need to only be collected if the employment  at the company occurred less than a year or so."
good,Senior Leadership Mgt. and Senior Stakeholders do not have a solid vision on strategies plans on how to leverage change mgt. in our company culture to get back to growth
good,The company was good to me .the company .relocated it intire facility  to virgins at the time I wasn't  I'm a place to relocate.excellent benefits fair pay.
good,"The company is good to work for, however there is not much room to grow especially in the scientific field.  The company has a lot of perks, including of course, beer and soda.  One negative part , the workplace culture is rather ""cup-throat"", individuals tend to be silo-ed in there job descriptions and team work is hard to come by."
good,"Had to build a lot of tires in 12 hour shifts and it was a lot of bending pulling and steady moving to make production . Had standards u had to make every day and lose money if you didn't.  Especially when running"
good,"A difficult company to advance within, and an often stressful environment.  Meetings consume a large portion of the day, and positive change comes slowly."
good,"old plant , poor management, long hours, good pay, union was there but not needed if you done your job, good location, to bad the had to shut it down."
good,Fast pace work environment with fun co workers. Management is good and somewhat fair to their employees. There is not really anything hard about my job other then a lot of walking but I am use to it. There is a lot to learn here at Miller Coors such as HHPC which is learning about the new cleaning chemicals to work with. My Co Workers make my job very enjoyable. Getting to know more about who they are really makes it well worth working in this team setting that is provided for me.
good,Good company to work for. Compensation and benefits are decent but nothing over the top. It depends where you at but things could be different.
good,Maximising sales of own brands and factored products within the area.Presenting products to increase brand awareness selling in features and benefits of new products and innovations.Price negotiations and deal structuring to increase distribution of brands.Prospecting new accounts gaining incremental income and volume.Analysis of sales reports in SAP to identify business opportunities within my account base.Gaining knowledge of competitors products and activities.Fantastic co-workers always enthustiastic and positive.Great incentives were awarded to employees.
good,"...trying to earn a promotion is difficult. Employees tend to rise to their level of incompetence - The Peter Principle is very prevalent within MillerCoors.  Also, they are losing a lot of good people due to this, there is a drain of talent going on here. Management has favorites and is oblivious that several of these people are complacent with little motivation. The process managers lack the knowledge of their process or the ""big picture"". To add, there is very little respect for knowledge of the craft of brewing, which is an area that is slowly chipping away at their market share."
good,Co-Workers great to work with.
good,This plant continues to shrink it production.   Millercoors will probably shut down one of the 5 plants left in the next few years.   Its sad to see a once great company decline.
good,Great Company with great benefits. Miller Coors offers challenges and opportunities to work in a complex environment and learn a lot about the manufacturing industry.
good,You will process a lot of samples. Be prepared. Try to get out and learn as much as you can. Free beer is nice if you meet the right people willing to share.
good,Not a whole lot to say..wasn't for me. They have great advancement opportunities but incredibly poor management and coaching. They focus so much on things they dont need to instead of things they should.
good,"Have not worked for company in over 30 years....anything I would write would not be relevant,"
good,Could be a fun place to work but 60 hour weeks are a norm.  Little opportunity for advancement.  Culture is location and management dependent.  Stable employment.  Opportunities for development exist.  Days are spent working with teams to achieve operational goals.
good,Great company culture overall but different managers and departments have their own cultures. Ending up on the wrong team can be detrimental to ones growth and ability to succeed as usual corporate politics by some managers will prevent advancement for some but accelerate it for others.
good,"the merger changed the landscape of this organization once made up of hard working, caring, smart and passionate people.  I started my career here and left before the big merger with Miller."
good,Coors was a good job.  I would still be there without the fact that when they merged I lost my full time status due to seniority.  I was offered to come back as a temp and decided not to.
good,"MillerCoors, like all publicly traded companies, is very very focused on bottom line and shareholder return. There are good processes and good people that work here."
good,It takes care of its employees. It's a good company but it has gone through some hard changes. It's worth working there and the pay is good along with the benefits offered.
good,"Management have favourites and if your not a favourite you will not be treated fairly."
good,Good overall.  Great work life balance.  Not much room for advancement and career development though.  The company was just bought by Molson Coors who is not very flexible.
good,I had to load trucks with the product as order says. Scanning in all the products to a certian truck and make sure that all product is loaded correctly so nothing will spill or fall over.
good,"Typical day - fast pace"
good,A very productive and beneficial experience being an intern with them. They gave me experiences I will always take with me.
good,"I would have loved the opportunity to grow with company but multicultural program was terminated. They had a great sales training program and flew us into Milwaukee about every three months."
good,Honestly haven't worked there long enough to really experience any positive or negative things about the place. I worked really long hours due to the lack of staff and inexperienced people they hired.
good,This is a wonderful place to work if your not a going through a temp agency. My advice is to just get hired on directly you will make more and not have to struggle with temporary wadges
good,filled beer kegs inspected kegs and got old beer out of reusable kegs so they can be refilled. cleaned and tore down line at end of shift
good,"Good place to work,good place to work. Good superviser good people  to work with good hours,good pay good work week have good work atmosphere"
good,"Good company to work for but long hours that include weekends, holidays, and off shift hours.  Plant locations are not great.  Company buy-out is pending so the future is uncertain."
good,"A typical day I was cashiering, prepping or cooking to order. I learned to work the grill and create station for made to order food for our customers. I enjoyed working here with all but one of the employees. Mgmt seemed too busy to recognize certain issues. I felt like I wasn't trained properly. The person who was suppose to train me basically told me to fend for myself so she couldn't get in trouble if I made mistakes."
good,Great place for pay.. No time off.  its a 7 day a week job everyweek
good,"good work environment with a lot of training, but very hard to get on permanent."
good,Since I only just spent a few months there it was a learning experience.  My co-workers as well as management were very helpful and took time to teach me what I needed to know.  The only hardest part of the job was there was too much down time and there was not alot to do.  The most enjoyable was getting to know all the workers.
good,"Long hours and many days in a row, but fun place to work with great people."
good,"Team was included in outside promos, launches. Each dept had guidelines and worked well within the enitre company."
good,"A typical day consisted of meeting with distributor representatives and sales representatives to coordinate marketing strategies, making account calls to schedule events and then attending and supervising events up to 4 or 5 nights a week."
good,"With all the talk about hiring people full time with benifits, I think was just a way to underpay people for a long amount of time. All the attention to detail I provided on shipping packages lead to no returns for 6 months. Which is kinda unheard of... Then they hired more people and everyone does every job pretty much. Till they messed up and i was put on shipping predominately."
good,"To many secrets among plant , hiring family when kept quiet , during summer you will work your life away . Extremely intense heat in summer . Swing shift is a must"
good,"All the Overtime you want or don't want.  It is a union so the pay is great and double-time on Sundays.  If you want a Saturday guaranteed off you must work Sunday, but even then those are guaranteed.  Overall pretty easy jobs to do as long as you have some sort of common sense."
good,"Historically good culture, managment struggling with merger(s) of Miller, Coors and Molson. advancement difficult beyond lower levels, cronyism is now entrenched in HR policy and actions. Coors history in business great- family, team oriented. Miller less so, more corporate. Molson misses the point of a management team, seems to be damaging what it just bought a year ago."
good,"Pretty typical work day for a senior level HR person - usually in around 7:30 or 8 leave about 6.  I traveled frequently between the Milwaukee and Chicago offices.  Milwaukee offices were desperate for a refresh, while the Chicago offices were state of the art and very vibrant.  Great ability to interact with colleagues at on-site pubs to wrap up the day and have informal meetings over a beer or two."
good,I enjoyed my job at Miller. I enjoyed the people I worked with. The only problem I ever had with Miller was the balance between family and job. I worked around 70 hours a week and when asking for time off to be with family it was hard to get.
good,"Nice place to work , good culture and encouraging folks .A typical day at work starts with Stand up meetings in a Scrum Master style of work. Very encouraging and supportive environment to work."
good,Worked extremely hard to maintain focus on the project I was hired for originally due to changing management styles and expectations. Delivered 15 consecutive years of revenue and profit growth for the category and the position was not maintained. I enjoyed the teamwork and my co-workers as they always worked to deliver their objectives within a very challenging category environment.
good,"The company as a whole is solid and weathered a tough economy, however the individual breweries have each struggled with their own cultural and leadership challenges.  "
good,A rapidly evolving business with an endless number of challenging projects.
good,"Typical day would include meetings, systems planning, coordination/facilitation of work amonst team members. Many opportunities to learn and improve skills. The most difficult part of the job was to coordinate the IT function with the outsourced support organization to resolve systems issues. It was also the most enjoyable as it provided opportunity to find new ways of working together."
good,"MillerCoors was a great place to be, the beer industry is changing a ton though and I wouldn't currently recommend it here.  Liquor is a better place to be given the industry trends."
good,Good People at all levels!  The upward mobility potential was truly an advantage when beginning my career at MillerCoors. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with this company.
good,"Work Perks:"
good,"After the acquisition, Miller changed a lot. The environment, the culture, everything. We became global without the skills to move and be successful globally because we weren't allowed to travel. It created a lot of tension and a lack of balance to feel like success was feasible for certain roles that morphed almost overnight."
good,Managers in Brewing somewhat isolated and disconnected from their workers. Little follow up or accountability for department employees. Many employees have a sense of entitlement and think they have a God given right to hour + long breaks without regard to pressing job needs. Managers know they need to get from point A to point B but struggle with how to do it. Dont always seek assistance from the right people and are often fooled into believing bad information.
good,Overall MillerCoors is a good place to work salary & benefits are excellent. Good career opportunities for hard working dedicated individuals. Salary and benefits are competitive. Yearly review process for salaried positions are too long and a waste of valuable time.
good,"Typical day is assuring production goes out with proper identification and packaging. The hardest part of the job is inputting different packaging codes in reference to items, destination and weight, as well as maintaining machinery well in operation."
good,"Everyday I informed my salesmen of new products and that were coming out and which ones to push and where the demographic would best be considered and consumed. I learned so much about craft beers and beer in general.  Management was very professional, fair and did their best to take care of the employees. My co-workers were apprehensive of a much younger man being hired on in middle management. The hardest part of the job was getting some of the bad apples to complete task given to them on a daily basis. I enjoyed being able to make my employees jobs easier and more enjoyable. Helping my guys meet quotas and making our business flourish."
good,"The first thing I do when I get up in the morning whilst the kettle is boiling is to log on to the system to see how the line is performing and check that what the reports are saying is correct. If I find anything unusual I'll contact the shift manager to see what is going on. When I reach the office I'll attend the Daily Operation Review meeting to get an oversight of the lines overall performance from the last 24 hours and then analysis the data against the reports."
good,Lack of communication is the hardest thing in this plant. Know one knows till it has to happen for things to run stop. No one crew can be on same page and it is aggravating.
good,"The job required a lot of traveling and visiting distributors within your designated territory."
good,"This is a great company with the chance to work with awesome individuals and grow your knowledge of beer and sales.  However, management turnover can provide either a really good experience or a really bad one depending on who's leaving/entering etc.  Location MUST be flexible...if you're in sales chances are you could end up somewhere you really despise living.  Sacrifice is mandatory in most instances.  The pay is really good and the flexibility is awesome.  Overall, a very good company."
good,not a big fan of the SMP program and the structure on how to grow in this company. You are not able to change from marketing to sales.
good,"I had a great bunch or co-workers and my immediate supervisor was excellent, best I ever had to work with. On the other hand higher level management were not so enaging or friendly."
good,"Great place to work but expect work a lot. Wonderful and comprehensive training program, excellent benefits."
good,Being everything for everyone and learning what to do without much help. The Business Development Director position was an undefined role by Coors - it was up to the individual to create their existence.
good,"Overall good company with excellent benefits and great people to work around daily.  There are some clique-ish tendencies, as with most large companies, but the company itself is a good one."
good,the most enjoyable part of the job is making dreams to life. Great place to work for marketing. I learned a lot and how to sale myself
good,MillerCoors was acquired by Molson Coors Brewing Company. A lot of merging and separation right now in IT. I enjoyed my time at MillerCoors. It was a great place to work at.
good,"Challenging.  Opportunity to make your own career.  Plenty of opportunity to achieve results."
good,"Fast pace, steady work, hard on your back. After you get use to it, its a great job. Good hours. Fair pay. Weekends off, 40 hour weeks are nice. friendly supervisors"
good,"Busy, fast paced, high energy with great people. Hard work and challenging at times but also times which were quieter."
good,"The head of the lab spent most of her time coordinating with the microbiologist who actually ran the lab and she only entered the lab on rare occasions.  So she knew very little about what happened in the lab.  Laboratory needs updating but functions relatively well.  My position was a contract microbiologists so pay was high starting but benefits were severely lacking, where as a full time Miller employed microbiologist would take on about 30% more responsibility and be paid almost twice as much with benefits.  Lots of overtime available which might be good or bad depending on your viewpoint.  Contracts are one year in length but usually are extended until the contractor notifies Miller otherwise.  I appreciated my time in this position but could have learned a lot more.  Contractors are used mostly to collect the large amount of different samples needed to be tested throughout the day.  With so many samples and such a large facility contractors spend most of their time collecting samples and repetitively testing those samples and very little is spent learning new lab procedures or inner workings or science of brewing.  60% warehouse work, 30% lab, 5-10% scientific learning."
good,"A company with very, very good benefits but some drawback on advancement especially in my department. Had a high turn over rate and constantly short staffed."
good,"There is never a rush to do anything around here. There is quite a bit of redundant equipment so if there is a breakdown, you just shut it down and start a new piece of equipment. You are paid very well for the amount of actual work that is required of you. The work rotation is bad, Rotate through the 3 shifts on a weekly basis, 7 nights 2 off 7 mids 2 off 7 days 3 off. Hard to have a family life when you are at work every day."
good,Decent pay but new employees get stuck working nights for an unknown amount of time. Lots of work and a union feel (everyone gets the same raises despite their value) without the union.
good,I simply had rather work with more people and less machinery. I worked seasonal only so there were no benefits but the pay was good. A typical day at work was to load the machine with product and watch to make sure product ran good. Did inspections timely. It was a very noisy atmosphere.
good,"A typical workday in MillerCoors composed for work more than 12hrs per day, it was a constant daily challenge. Management could be better, talking about workplace structure it's really marked because each division works separately without any results tracking, each region works to compete for its own, the hardest part was that I used to work alone without any help most of the time. The most enjoyable part was according to the different qualities of the work gives you the opportunity to develop to the fullest."
good,"Overall not a bad place to work. The benefits are amazing,"
good,"Excellent pay, but work life balance is not very good. Lots of overtime available and money to be made. Union work environment has it's pluses and minuses for the job."
good,"We’re committed to creating the best team in beer. It takes a diverse group of innovators, thought leaders, problem solvers and influencers to deliver results and make cool ideas a reality. We grow skills on the job and in the classroom with our award-winning MillerCoors University. And no matter your needs, our benefits are competitive and the perks are many. From family leave and dependent care, to flexible work options and even allowances for free beer, our people are rewarded with more than just a paycheck. At MillerCoors, we do more than brew great beer, we craft great caree"
good,"A lot of people have been there a long time, so there isn't a lot of opportunity, and the environment is rather stale, yet very intense.  Compensation structure is good, training is good.  Recent divestiture and acquisition activity has introduced considerable uncertainty in employment situations.  People in sales roles are given unreasonable sales targets given the beer industry diminishing volume."
good,Great place to work though work-life balance and compensation while not the greatest are improving. New mgmt is much more focused on feedback from the field which is good.
good,I like working at Coors but it was not my ideal job as it was very far away and the hours were long and over night. I get paid fairly well but i do not think i would do it again.I was a temp here for about a year and it was very difficult to being a permanent employee. they only open up that opportunity about once a year.
good,"Great place to work with great collegues, exciting products and good clean work environment. Although we worked long and hard, we also played well and the company was good to it's employees. I would work there again, but it is a ""youth driven"" culture for more recent grads - not for seasoned staff."
good,"MillerCoors is a company that is going through a transition of the merge with Molson/Coors and Miller Brewing Company. MBC is owned by SAB, Coors is owned by Molson/Coors. Transition is about 70% of where it needs to be after 3.5 years. Confident that the company will be a much better place to work, but time line is still about 5 years in total."
good,I enjoyed working with the people in the department I worked in.  The project I was assigned to was interesting and team members were very helpful and engaged.
good,"Good employees, everyone always happy and enjoyed doing there job. Managers always concerned about there safety which was big in the conpany and of others."
good,miller coors is a great place to work for its always busy monday-sunday. people in my department (machinist) have great attitude but others a bit difficult to be around. Union job with great pay.
good,"Working in beer is fun, but luxury wears off over time and becomes a very corporate culture.  Leadership is strong, but not a lot of room to grow outside of working on different brands within the same category"
good,"Too many touchie-feelie mandatory seminars. Meetings are nothing more than a gripe-a-thon, and nothing gets accomplished.The pay is good, and the benefits are top notch."
good,"Miller Coors due my work status it were a most enjoyable workplace. The management were very friendly and very helpful with what you learned .  On a typical work day,"
good,Molson was a great a company to work for. I love their work hard play hard motto. They understand that employees have a life outside of work which was great for me as a working mom of 2.
good,Great place to work. First real job. Worked hard but pay compensated. Shift work was difficult on family and body. some political promotions that were not warranted.
good,Much like at every company the manager can make or break your job and career and at MillerCoors.  Get an awesome manager and the job and career can be great.
good,"Coors was an okay place to work. the pay was good, however, becoming permanent was not an easy task. In addition some of the policies were one sided and favoritism as to who they applied the rule to."
good,Industrial type setting. This work is very hard labor. Hot work environment. Drink plenty of water and be ready to get dirty. Pretty hard to move up positions at the brewery.
good,This is the second time I have been requested to complete and submit a review for the same company.  Please stop requesting the same request.  Please advise.
good,"There, I have learned a lot on many different aspect about the delivery. Indeed, I was currently using a forklift inside the warehouse and on the route, the colleagues teached how to work fast with efficiency."
good,Did not like the unexpected plant closure of MillerCoors best plant out of all 8 plants and the severance package givin . the non-willing to work with emplotees looking for other jobs as they said they would .
good,"Good people and management..."
good,"my internship was pretty cool. I learned that i have a passion for beer. the smell, the people, and the free beer! it was a group of hard working and play even harder environment."
good,"Great place to work. Culture is great and the work is really engaging. Besides, getting free beer is always a plus. Great for gifts."
good,"Limited career opportunities and work/life balance is challenging.  Pay and benefits are very competitive, but work hours tend to fluctuate without much notice"
good,"Nice People, dirty workplace, management not so understanding to improve conditions."
good,"Invoice entry and statement review.  Customer services internal and external."
good,“Fast paced manufacturing environment so there is always pressure to achieve certain production targets.”
good,Life was great until they out sourced jobs when the companies merged.
good,"We work 12 hour rotating shifts. Everyday is a little different so it doesn't get boring.  I learned to operate double fork forklift, pull lines and operate keg forklift. Everyone is very helpful and friendly. The hardest part is the cold temps and moving kegs. "
good,"If you can get a full time position, go for it. Everyone I work with is great, however it seems impossible to get from a temporary position to full time employment. If that is your goal, I would advise not to take a temporary position here."
good,I learned the packaging line of the brewery. I learned that management and unions are a very different environment. I learned the warehouse procedures. Operating a dual load forklift. Had fun loading the trailers learning the computer in where the next pallets were to load in the trailors. Learned the packaging lines and how to service some of the machines. Hardest part of the job was carefully unjamming the bottle line when some of the bottles were broken with out cutting yourself.
good,"A very busy and dynamic place to work, with a wide variety of personalities working in the Marketing Team. Good place to develop your career, with a melting pot of Marketing experience to help you along the way."
good,"Trades and production techs are well paid and benefits are good. Rotating shifts are a take away."
good,"High-stress, competitive environment.  But pays very well and let's be honest, it's just cool to work in the beer industry.   The coworkers at my level were exemplary.  But corporate management is making some decisions, in my opinion, that are not well advised to keeping a business in a struggling industry afloat."
good,"The company is fine.  I don't have much to say."
good,I enjoyed my time at Miller. This was my second home. The employees are passionate about making beer. You build strong relationships that last for a lifetime.
good,"learning new equipment everyday. good benefits. and great discounts on products. working with various machinery and people. "
good,"people were excellent to work with. temporary employees were treated as regular time emplo yees, managers were great with people and communicated well. i learned to work in a fast paced manufacturing environment in the food industry, the culture on the production floor was very good. most people were willing to work together to ahievve a common goal. the hardest part of the job was the weather. the most enjoyable part of the job was the people."
good,"Enjoyed my job. Most of the people were great to work with. Was planning to retire from the company, but the facility I worked at shut down. Great benefits. Needed work in the management department, but overall, a great place to work."
good,good place to wk at if you can get in there very stressful as a temp but once you get on full time it is a good job for life. dont miss any days or be late you have a 6 month probation period
good,It's a really great place to work with great benefits and great pay but it is a shame that they closed the number 1 brewery in the millercoors network.
good,"My day normally consists of collecting or analyzing data to figure out why certain packaging defects are occurring.  It is relatively easy work compared to what I was doing in school but the group I work with is very nice and are always there to give me advice.  "
good,"Fast pace constant change and exciting. People are friendly and want to do a good job. Management can micro manage, but mean well and are working towards changing the culture.."
good,"cet emploi est très motivante puisque je dois toujours être active physiquement et mentalement, c'est a dire que je dois vérifier la qualités des produits et s'assurer qu'il respecte les normes puisqu'il vont par la suite sur le marché de consommation .De plus, je dois être présent à 100% pour exercer les tâches et responsabilités reliées à mon emploi qui consistait à alimenter et vérifier les machines de production de bière.Actuellement, il y a pas beaucoup de possibilité d'avancement au sein de la compagnie dans mon cas, car cela peut prendre plus de 10 ans a devenir permanent et ce n'es pas assuré.Contenu de cela, je souhaite pouvoir avoir la chance de travailler dans une compagnie qui me permettrons mettre en application mes connaissances et expérience  et de réaliser des défis professionnelles et personnelles.L'aspect le plus difficile de cet emploi est le fait d'être sur appel puisque je suis une personne très organiser et cela me permet pas de bien gérer ma vie professionnel et personnelle.Pour ce qui est de l'aspect le plus agréable c'est l'ambiance de travail tout les personnes sont sympathiques au sein de la compagnie."
good,I am a temp but it seems to be a great place with good benefits for employees. People are very friendly and the training received was good.
good,"Overall I have had several opportunities at MillerCoors, however recent changes force me to look at other employers. Management is average and lacks understanding of their people."
good,"""Core"" office team is supportive. All team members work very hard to reach sales objectives and take the company's values to heart."
good,I manually recorded the production of beer on a daily basis.  I recorded accruals and performed monthly inventory reconciliation and calculated the excise tax returns for the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms.  In this position I learned the importance of improving a process.
good,I get to dress up and work for a few hours to go to bars and restaurants and promote our product. I have a lot of fun interacting with people. My co-workers are also friendly and easy to get along with which makes working even more fun. Almost every one likes beer so it is not hard to get consumers to purchase our product.
good,Most of the support staff (everyone but Marketing and Sales) have been let go so not sure what the culture will be moving forward. While I was there the culture was good.
good,It is unionized. High speed equipment. Fast-paced work methods for operators. Always on your feet. Good place to work but there is no work/life balance.
good,"Managing day to day customer needs, asks, market dynamics and distributors. Tons of CPG experience and leading the team in customer business strategy. Culture is shifting constantly. When sales are good, culture is good, when sales are soft, culture is not good. Hardest part of the job is sometimes managing internal expectations with the real world. The most enjoyable part is what I learn on a daily basis."
good,"Good place to work but would be great if the company give more opportunities to contractors to be extended or hired."
good,great place great pay good benefits. the treat there people well and would continue to work there if i did not have to relocate out of the elevation. if you are looking for a great place to work Apply at MillerCoors Brewing
good,"Overall, the company is a great place to work, lot's of cultural changes though.  Great brands and leadership is moving in the right direction.  Would recommend this company to work for."
good,Good company with great benefits.  Advancement opportunities were lacking.  Pay was great and employees treated fairly.....................................................
good,"If you want to make plenty of money this would be the place to work. Long hours, lots of weekends at work. Very limited family time.  Other than that the benefits are great.  Management is very aggressive and cut throat."
good,Productivity was the goal of each day.  I learn a lot about  how important prioritizing your work can be within the workplace.  The culture was both competitive and team oriented .  The hardest part was determining how to maximize your departmental productivity goals while achieving overall plant management plans and corporate mission plans when there were apparent conflicts of interest.
good,Rotating shift work job on a 4 days on 4 days off schedule.  12 hour shifts with a wide variety of different roles and responsibility depending on the day.  Must be comfortable with Hazmat response in Level A suits with SCBA and full-face respirators.  Physically demanding work with many hazards to mitigate..
good,well if I was on the floor I would find my forklift and go to the office for per shift meeting .Then go do the job I was assigned to go do! If I was in the office clerking .I had to be there early to get the pre shift information ready to tell the other workers on the floor.Then start putting in orders for the loaders to load and unload. Eden was a great group of people we all were a team. I would also do warehouse inventory .
good,"Coors was a great company, I worked there as a contractor and then a perm employee.  In the 4 years I worked there, I worked in 3 departments and 8 managers.  Lots of re-org activity made for some instability."
good,"The culture and people are great to work with.  However, work load is heavy.  They do offer great benefits and job security.  Location is absolutely spectacular."
good,Excellent pay but frequently changing leadership and work environment. Overtime work most weeks but descent vacation packages. Bargaining unit employees seem to be pushed and pulled often because of management and union leadership issues.
good,"The job was overall pretty great.  The people there are really awesome. Unfortunately the position I had was contracted and it seemed very difficult to get a full time position that included all of the benefits there.  The schedule was pretty demanding, 12 hour shifts on a rotating schedule of nights and days."
good,I learned a lot of my electrical engineering skills here with hands on work.
good,Great place to start a career. Growth does get slowed with the volatility of beer industry
good,"-Typical Day: review objectives for each account on the day's route, drive to storage unit/distributor to load up car with necessary support materials, make 10 physical account calls, recap each visit in my living route plan, communicate sales to the distributor rep for each respective account to ensure product gets shipped in."
good,"Enjoyed the people, structure, brands and compensation, however STRONG challenges with integration of larger organization. Management lacks focus."
good,Temp for Coors. forklift driver in the can plant.  Multi level warehouse with sections for placement. daily assignments and set schedule as a temp. The possibility to get hired is low.
good,Good culture all around. Big beer business is changing so the company is trying to grow as well. Have a phenominal onboarding process and take care of their employees
good,"Performed preventative maintenance on all the overhead doors. Cleaned up the lists of overhead doors. Oversee the FLS, GMT, and plumbing teams on preventative maintenance and repairs"
good,"L'horaire change souvent, une semaine tu peux être de jour, l'autre de soir et l'autre de nuit."
good,A good workplace culture with opportunity to learn. The company demands a results but is not overly demanding. A typical day involves visiting customers and multiple hours of emails/ expenses
good,Miller coors is a fast paced work enviornment and can be quite stressfull at times. the people are friendly and highly focused on the task they are assigned to.

Great managers and wonderful coworkers. Best fit for those who can streamline and prioritize workflow in a constantly changing, fast-paced environment. Workplace culture is laid back. It's fine to wear jeans and most problems are fixed easily without pointing fingers at anyone. Hardest part of the job is achieving balance between work and home life. Most enjoyable part of the job are your teammates."
good,"nice place to work, my supervisor was point blank he told you what to do and left you alone. coworkers were always relatable and professional. Had my own vehicle to get back and forth to work areas"

good,"I enjoyed my time at miller coors. I loved the people, co workers, supervisors and other management. "
good,The work location would be the same for the week unless you are an extra then you can move all over from day to day . You have to load the product on 3 differant floors. Either you will be loading on the floor for TRUCKS or the floor for RAILCARS or the floor for putting away in storage. You have to be fast enough to find a forklift and go to the appropriate floor and not back up the line. This job had actually taught me how to properly distribute the loads in not only the trucks but rail cars as well.

good,"Lots of training and great management.  Completely paid for all fees for my CIS degree 100% while I attended school while working.  Put me into a new job as soon as degree was reached.  Learned tons about data, Business Objects, SQL.  We also were taken to distributor conventions once a year in places like New Orleans, Hawaii and Las Vegas.  Great group of people to work with.  The merger with several other beer companies and loss of family ownership has changed the culture quite a bit from what I understand.  Best job I've ever had!!!!"

good,"A typical day at work includes a great deal of meetings which can negatively impact productivity....delivering results. The beer industry is changing significantly due to the number of millienials preferred taste buds to craft beers and the increase in the Hispanic population therefore the perception of beer being a good ol boy beverage is no longer however Senior Leadership does not reflect this makeup. The workplace culture has changed over the past few years from collaboration, teamwork to covering my you know what and operating more independently, exclusively"
good,If you like doing the same thing over and over again without much change other than the additional overtime you will be assigned then this is a great job for you.
good,"The management was impressive and I was allowed overtime, even as an temp worker. I was trained properly and was able to problem solve issue alone/group meetings."

Operating a forklift and training mutiple personel with taking it off and putting in back on the tractor and trailer while also teaching the right way with how to lean forks and pick up and set pallets down."
good,"The typical Day was working directly with Distributor principals, engaging the sales team to focus on your portfolio in a multi brand house.  This was my favorite part of the job.  The company has changed ownership since I left, so I can not speak to it now"
good,"This is a great giant money maker through beer. Has a clear strategy and very well established policies, procedures and best practices. People are better paid than majority of comparable companies. Unfortunately it sells alcohol which does not produce an real benefit to consumers. So, it should revise its corporate conscience to re-invest in the society intensely."
good,This is a great place to work if you are able to get into a permanent direct hire position. Everyone stays here once they are a direct employee. The culture and personality of the comapny as a whole would make it a great place to work.
good,"A typical work day at MillerCoors involves trying to become the lowest cost producer of our products. This includes trying to elimate waste, produce product faster, and most importantly ensuring the teams work safely. From an automation standpoint, the equipment used to produce, package, and ship the product is done via high speed equipment. The hardest part is knowing that there exist better technology but with budget constraints you have to be innovative in working with older equipment. Enjoyable part is at the end of the day, we can laugh and have a beer with our peers."

good,Inspecting bottles package check inventory mangement not great at all got along with other people hardest part was working grave yard learning bottling.
good,"Working with MillerCoors is very rewarding, yet extremely hard to manage if you don't have good time management. It is a lot of planning, numbers and reporting. Budget reports and expense reports are a must."

good,I am very satisfied with MillerCoors and the people I work with.  I would recommend this company to any potential candidate.
good,"A typical day usually starts with a meeting or two, which last anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour for each one.

I will enter payroll each day, keep track of attendance, handle any discipline issues, check on ongoing projects, and work on budgets"

Home based position also working nights and weekends.

The most enjoyable part of my job is how closely I get to work with our alliances, the Tampa Bay Bucs, Tampa Bay Lightning and Tampa Bay Rays."
good,"While working at molson coors gained insight into the inner workers of breweries and how product is organized and distributed throughout the warehouse. I was given first hand experience in product packaging and movement of full goods and return glass. "
good,"My position was to manage a portfolio of products in a designated territory in Houston in approximately 100 off-premise independent chain and grocery stores.  I used weekly sales reports to compare and help to increase sales, negotiate more shelf and floor space and negotiate new products into existing sets.

I negotiated displays in return for scheduling and attending weekly promotional events in the stores meant to increase sales in my top 30 accounts. I used local and national programs to execute sales initiatives in my territory and exceeded all quotas earning several awards and winning contests. The company provided a base salary, yearly bonus and excellent benefits."
good,"Work is always at fast pace, I love it that way. I learned a lot of things working at Millercoors, Like running all different types of machines, on how to troubleshoot, How to maintain a constant work flow. Upper management was good, they came around ounce in a while to say hi and to see how the team was doing and what we can do to improve on somethings. My co-workers were more my team and family were always helping on another out. I think the hardest part about the job was how many days we would work without a day off. My most favorite part of the job was running the machines and doing the change overs on them."
good,"A typical day starts with looking at tickets that have come in for the Elkton site.  We use Service Now.  Look for tickets assigned to me and also to my co-worker."
good,"My temporary job with Miller Brewing Co. was great. There was lots of great people, pay, room for advancement, and not to mention a very refreshing product. The job also came with a sense of pride knowing you were helping make such a great product."
good,"warehouse worker, truck loader, machine operator, 1 year emlpoyed"

good,"The focus during that period was about beating Bud and Bud Light.  We dominated craft sales for the most part, with Blue Moon destroying competitors and locals were still small potatoes."
good,"Definitely fun and interactive, great hands on training and tools to survive in a tough industry.  You learn the business, and if you push yourself, you can learn even more.  It's also fun and a job in which you manage yourself.  If you're innovative, a self-starter, and energetic/positive, you should succeed."
good,It was hard to build spark at market place. It was good working in the company but too much travel for the job. Had good manager and had good working together.
good,"The sales role focuses on combining story telling, relationship building, and business acumen.  The job requires you to keep non-traditional hours, and be flexible.  Keys to success are establishing and maintaining proper expectations, and not being afraid to fail.  Management is great, though there are gaps as people transition between roles.  Hardest part of the job is the hours, you don't really have a ""typical"" day.  Most enjoyable part of the job is the company itself -- it's an incredible culture and group to work with; the industry is second-to-none as well."
good,It is a nice place to work most of the employees are great to work with. Management is great! They do offer great benefits and try to keep a safe working environment.

good,"I was only a temporary employee working a contract position."
good,"I enjoyed working at MillerCoors, however I left the company shortly after the merger to go back to school.  So while I worked there it was Molson Coors.  The people in the lab and throughout the brewery are excellent to work with.  The benefits of working at a brewery are enjoyable as well.  "
good,overall good company.still hesitant if the adveacment is there. mangers are nice and look out for you. the department im in seems to be a brick wall. hopefully more departments to spread my wings

good,"We work hard here at MillerCoors to make sure we make the country's best beer.  We also have a strong community involvement and are encouraged to volunteer in the community.  Of course, lots of free beer too :)"
good,Overall it a great job. During peek season do not look for to many days off. It's not a hard job that I know of just have to be able to comprehend and willing to learn.
good,I was a finance intern at MillerCoors last summer and It was a great experience. The staff was very helpful and I felt like they are very supportive in helping me develop my skills. It was a super relaxed work environment and very flexible. You get a lot of free beer and a lot of time to explore other departments that you may be interested in.
good,"Millers is a great company, its the management at the time that was not so great unfair  treatment , did not honor their words, lack of support. Company polices driven by union"
good,"I wish I could have stayed there longer, I was finally beginning to feel comfortable and learn new things, my husband had a major unexpected surgery and my boss wanted me back to work before I could. My husband was in the hospital for a week. I advised my supervisor with all information I could and he still ended my assignment"
good,I simply handed out chachki's and free beer and got paid to do it.  Simply smile and have a good time.  It's a win win situation.  I enjoy making people happy. :)
good,My day is full continuos running and keep the line going did quality checks had team meeting before every shift work in a team enviroment
good,This job could be the best some days and the worst other days. In a typical day I get to work at 5:45pm for my shift from 6pm to 6am. I would go to my team meeting and the line leader would talk about safety and what we could expect to package for that night. I would then head over the part of the line that I was working and operate that one machine for the whole shift. I learned how t operate dozens of different types of packaging equipment and safety regulations such as PPE and lock out tag out. I met some really cool people there and made a lot of friends. The management was always a bit harder on temporary employees like myself but were good and fair people. My favorite part of working at Coors were the people and how we became a team over a short amount of time.
good,"When I worked at Coors I felt job secure"
good,"Great job, fantastic business, nice people.  Overall , great place to work.  Benefits are top notch and company believes in work like balance."

Was well paid and appreciated.  They also encouraged outside Community activities at which I excell i.e. planning company functions and was the Coordinator for a Miller sponsored Habitat for Humanity Home.
good,"Unloading product from the truck, I found out how different retail stores wanted the product put on the floor and in the basement or storerooms and how the store manager, wanted his or her floor to look, like with the product. The different drivers that I assisted were great to work with and the fun about the job was traveling the city."
good,Learned a lot in a very supportive atmosphere. Management was very supportive and the free beer was always a plus. Department meetings were productive and fun.
good,Good company with a solid position in the industry.
good,"If you move into a production role you will be entering a fast paced environment, but don't expect a lot of pressure to actually meet production quota's, they will have you work overtime without blinking. Compensation is very good unless you are a temp. Probably the highest in the business. Once you get into a permanent role expect to stay there. They don't do a lot of internal advancement. They do not care about a work life balance and will work you to death. But they do have good vacation and some very good benefits."
good,"A good place to work for, but i disagree with the policy they have for temp employees. cant not miss any days. but was in a car wreck and let go due to the doctor having me out of work. i belive that is not fair, because it was out of my control."
good,"•	Developed and maintained selling relationships with 60 high-image, high-volume on-premise retailers in key young-adult markets in South Jersey"

good,"A lot of my time at Coors was wasted in endless, unproductive staff meetings and interminable team building sessions that did nothing but strengthen the lack of morale."
good,"Partnered up through CU-Boulder and was my senior design project for the 2016-17 year. Worked with a professional engineer to enhance a current unload system from a 176,000 pound railcar through pumping and pipe systems."
good,"Incredible portfolio of brands, great people, no complaints! MC has a word hard play hard culture that rewards performance and teamwork. The mandate is to grow by 2019!"
good,"Only got to work for about 2 months, before they laid off an entire shift. Due to poor economy, they weren't able to produce 24/7 like usual. They did treat us great though, as I recall, we got 2 45min lunch breaks, that were paid. Regular employees also were eligible to get free cases of beer each month."
good,"good,good environment and was able to avdance, great manager team, good, none, at was like family"
good,"Working as a brand ambassador for Miller Coors was a fun, exciting, and rewarding job. The team felt more like a family and the work didn't feel like work."
good,Very smart organization that is using data analytics to drive business decisions. Enjoyed the culture and people at MillerCoors. Great Brands and fun working environment.
good,"choose not to review, due to the fact that the plant I worked in was shut down. Given the best plant award for five years in a row, how crazy is that! Thats all I have to say,"
good,A great place to work. I made some good money and worked a lot of hours here. I would work here again in the future if they open up a plant near me again.
good,"Molson was a good company to work for until they announced that they were closing down the Burrard Plant. Their  wages and health benefits were excellent. The workers were easy to get along with and "
good,Busy work place with great management. There are different types of jobs available to learn which was great because it gave you a variety of work to do.

good,"The best working experience I have had.  Terrific company, benefits and people.  Enjoyed the various routine tasks assigned to me and welcomed the challenge of new opportunities."
good,"I really enjoyed working at MillerCoors and met a lot of great people and made some great friends. They took the time to teach you what you needed to know about the machine you was working with and what you was expected to do.  "
good,Excellent place to work...I was working a contract to change out all computers on the whole site. I enjoyed it very much and when the contract was over I was sad but I enjoyed the experience.
good,Great place to work with great benefits.  The only issue I have with this company is the relationship between hourly and salary employees.  It seems there is an Us vs them attitude and we should all be on the same page.
good,"Competitive and great place to work.  Many benefits with chance to advance with new and growing work force.  Many newly installed Packaging Department equipment with main challenges being fact that equipment runs at near maximum speeds with many sizes of packages, but everyday different and challenging!"
good,"The beer business is sexy.  It's fun to be a part of a social industry such as brewing.  Sometimes with all of the manufacturing struggles, you can easily forget that it's a blessing to be working in BEER!  Compared to other manufacturing companies, MillerCoors is head and shoulders above the rest."
good,A typical day at work consist of staying focus on the task of maintaining all machine work and being stay so I could go home to my family everyday. We worked in a family oriented environment so lock-out and tag-out was extremely important for myself and others. The hardest part of the job was working in the cold room where the temperature had to stay below 34 degrees year round. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with associates.
good,"This was a pilot program that we kicked off in Orlando. As a result, there were a lot of questions in the beginning about what we ought to be doing. We were given a great amount of freedom to promote our products and had very flexible schedules."
good,Working for MillerCoors was my dream job. It is all I thought I wanted to do with my life. After working there for 8 months I was burnt out. Everyone I worked with was absolutely amazing. I didn't run into a single person that I didn't like. The only complaint I had about this position is that there is zero to none work-life balance. Along with a normal sales route of attending 40 account calls you are expected to put on 10 consumer events per week. You are graded by how many monthly goals you hit and that is it. Take the chance if you think you have what it takes.
good,"Began the day with a pre shift meeting with employees on shift. Safety first above production, communication great with team. A good day made scheduled production and no accidents. Great employees who wanted to do a good job. Monthly recognition meetings help boost competitive competition between work groups. Yearly celebrations for Brewery of the Year."
good,"Pessoas e ambiente de trabalho agradável para trabalhar."
good,a day at work to get all of the orders process and out the door in a orderly manner to meet production to communicate with your supervisors and coworkers with whatever is going on with the line.well when the bottles keep on breaking before going in the machine the most enjoyable day when everything is going fine.
good,"I teamed up with a wonderful person, she taught me everything about the lid-feed. Hardest part was getting our rain gear on to clean and sanitize the line once a month. I thoroughly enjoyed working here."
good,This is the best job that I ever had!  People were like family!  We were well compensated for work done. Great benefits. I would love to retire there!
good,MillerCoors is an amazing company to work for with fun and inviting people. Every day was a fun and busy environment that always will keep you on your toes. The pay may not be the best but the benefits and the people make the job worth it!
good,Working at MillerCoors was challenging and fast paced.  I typically worked between 9-10 hours a day and was in a weekend rotation.  Good vacation and benefits and great people to work with.  Management was results focused and rewarded key contributors.
