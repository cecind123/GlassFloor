rating,review
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Immediate management such as my team leaders were great. A very productive and fast workplace. Co workers were great and helpful. Hardest part of the day is when call volumes are at their highest.
good,"Working here did provide a way to care for my family and help keep the bills paid, however having a schedule that changed on an almost weekly basis did not help when trying to plan things with my family as my significant other had a relatively set schedule. Given the nature of the work, the amount and the required expectations the hourly wage is questionable as to its fairness of pay, even with the bonus system they have for sales and customer satisfaction."
good,mai une pression de dingue pour demander d’arrêter de stresser et laisse pas la moindre chance se qui est bien dommage
good,"Working for my company can be a bit of a pain. on most Paydays there is nothing but hassle most people don't even get paid until a couple of days after it because ""they had system issues"" I have worked here for over 4 years and every payday month there is always a problem. My typical working day would be cold calling customers with o2 and trying to sell them an additional contract. I don't really learn that much in there because they simple don't offer it you have to go by your on initiative at most times. Managers in the work place are very good tho, Sometimes they aren't always there when you need them but they are of a high standard. Co-workers are great get on really well with them, There is some great people in there. Hardest part of my job is coming in and doing it because there is no challenge or motivation any more. Most enjoyable part is getting that 1st sale early in the day and seeing co-workers. Also making customers happy and actually saving them money instead of costing them money."
good,I enjoyed working for the company and I enjoyed working from home I answered the phones and did sales for 8 hours. I worked from home and I really like the direct tv project that we worked on.  I did sales and customer trouble shooting and bill issues for the customer
good,if you like the call center cubical environment you will like this job. Answering repetitive tech support and billing issues
good,Worked there for 5 years and hated it as the years went one. People running the company only care about the profits and not loosing customers than doing the right thing and letting some go because they don't deserve what they are asking for. Management never takes the employees word
good,"The work schedule was okay because it's a day shift and I had a normal life. I learned to become more patience in terms of dealing with my customer. For the management part, they were all accommodating and approachable but in terms of commission it was  something that employees can't be inspired of. The most enjoyable part of the job was the activities that are open to everyone to join and the part where I knew my customer was satisfied with the assistance I provided to them."
good,"Nine hour shift. Speaking to up to 70 customers with enquiries and offering help and guidance. "
good,It's a fun working environment. I love talking to customers and especially the friends that i gained in the company. They are also providing incentives and support that will benefit not just the employee but also our families.
good,"A good company for short term employment."
good,"Good company for beginning your career and gain experience. Difficult to move up within."
good,"customer service for AT&T internet, uverse television and telephone installation trouble shooting.  Basic technical support via call center phone answering"
good,You have to have a lot of patience with this job but it pays well.the hardest part of the job was finding out how to fix the customer problem.
good,"I had a great time working the late night shift at Convergys. It's your typical call center dirty carpets, small cubicles,lots of noise, and high demands to push sales. I loved providing technical support but having to push sales to meet quotas is extremely annoying."
good,Minacs is a great company to work for. This is not a company that you can create a career out of though. It was a great job for the time that I was there.
good,Dynamic workplace that includes the interaction with an international team. Continuos learning for customer service assistance as well as better use of the languages.
good,"Everyday you walk in and sit down to a large call volume so you're never bored. You take calls and then write notes about the call for future representatives to reference, if you need to speak to your supervisor or Team Leader they are easy to find and helpful. Convergys has a large turn over rate so there are always new people to meet and talk to and every few months it feels like a change over in staff. I did learn about ownership at Convergys which is something that I have taken with me through all of my jobs since. Ownership is important because once you are involved with someone's issue or have taken on a responsibility it is easier and faster for you to complete the job than hand it off to someone else. I also learned that   there are many kinds of good and bad customer service. The templates help but a person can figure out what another person wants by listening to their words, voice, tone and so much more.The hardest part was trying to help store front shops who were assisting especially difficult customers but it could be done. The best part was taking the extra step in assisting someone with their issue and making them feel like they had been heard and helped as much as possible."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"It was okay to work, it was quiet and you were off to yourself, the team work effort was not all that good. The time they put into making and helping you exceed was not too good. The overall job was a good experience to have."
good,"The process I worked with was for Intuit and it was completely a data related process. But convergys being a BPO had the same rules for everyone. The stringent policies for leaves, ratings and process of work were the same for us as in their bpo. These may have worked with the BPO culture but for us it was very uncomfortable. They failed to notice or bring into consideration that different types of industries need different sets of rules."
good,"A typical day at work is all about anticipating a good day in getting a lot of calls-preferably internet/technical in nature. The next is worrying about how to keep the call short to fall w/in established time limits. Also it is about how best to avoid transferring the customer and preventing customer callbacks since it requires approval and other administrative alerts using our existing callback systems/timekeeping program."
good,"Fun workplace with nice and kind Subject Matter Experts (SME) and approachable Team Leads. Big chances for promotion because of growing account in the company. There's only a lot of changes that needs to be expected, that comes to an end of being prepared everyday."
good,"A great entry or temporary job that is good for handling bills, gaining experience, and passing time until something else comes by."
good,They hours were great an the team was very small but assisted one another during many technical an new program training.
good,"This job was great at the time being, there was room for advancement through the company, which was something that I enjoyed. I did feel like in training you were taught the basics of the company, where as once you hit the call center floor, it was up to you to have to shine. Which didn't bother me much, do to me being a fast paced worker."
good,"good starting job, good flexibility on hours, good benefits. They have corporate events which makes the workplace seem more than just a job"
good,"Convergys is a company that works between client and customer. The branch in which I worked was purely AT&T customer service and sales. The job required taking anywhere between thirty to forty inbound calls a day to resolve AT&T customer issues. A typical day on the phones would handle a variety of issues. This could be anything from phone and service problems, all the way to retention of customer accounts. Adaptability and creativity was an enormous part of this job, as about 12 systems had to be opened on each individual call.  While going through these systems, one still had to individualize the experience to ensure complete customer satisfaction."
good,"First job after college, and joined with lot of my other college friends. This was the time i learn a lot and lot of fun at work."
good,"The environment at Minacs is very pleasant.  Co-workers say hello and ask about your day, while managers always make contact within a day.  During the day customers are provided strong service and efficient results.  As any call center or customer service position, customers are both the most enjoyable and most difficult part of the job."
good,Great place to work with. Very friendly environment. Learned many things especially in the field of BPO and Customer support. Hardest part of the job is when customer are very mad and it's very hard to change there mood to good. Enjoyable part of the job is that the environment is not boring.
good,"Good place to Start."
good,i enjoyed my job i won an ipad for making sales and really enjoyed the management and the coworkers i didnt just feel like a number
good,"answer billing and general questions from Directv customer, and try to sell them new service or upgrade there severe.  Take payments. Work at home."
good,The Compensation Team is very friendly. This organization is very large and global. The headquarters location is nice.
good,"was a great place to work,hours was great and love my manager, Great incentives and lots of overtime. Management needs a little work done but overall I enjoyed working there"
good,I loved this job. It was very fast paced on an individual basis. My co-workers were awesome. We worked as a team very well. The worst part of this job was having to fire people and the best part was training new employees.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Nice place to work. Located very near Interstate 4 in Lake Mary. Campus has a Hot food Cafe and a small snack store. Typical Call Center
good,"it was a job, that offered you an opportunity to earn extra perks when sales were made above your normal call expectations"
good,This job has been a great experience however i think i have out grown the enviorment and and need something more structed as far as scheduling.
good,"Stressful yet satisfied."
good,"It seems like everyone inside of Convergys gets let go every 5 months, which I'm sure had nothing to do with the bonus you got after 6 months of working there. "
good,"fun workplace with games and prices."
good,"a typical day at work was to take as many calls as you can and work with upper management to get the customer what they wanted if it was above my protocol. "
good,"•	Handling and coordinating multiple accounts for executing change requests within defined SLA"
good,"Over the phone pharmacy tech work"
good,"My work day would start at 7 am. I would clock in and work would start immediately. After about two hours, I would go to my first break if I had the chance, since calls would come in. T After that, lunch was next, and the same process repeated, untill my last break."
good,"a typical day is very interesting, the schedule changes every three month in which i wish it would stay one set schedule. there are three different shifts but with different days off which changes every three months. the company has a point system in which i don't really care for. i love the fact that the insurance starts as soon as you are hired."
good,"Not a bad company to work for, very high turnover rate but the contract keeps you busy. Dealing with irate customers was the most tedious part of the job."
good,"A typical day at work for me was waking up in the morning having my coffee then logging into my systems for the project I was assigned to. I enjoyed the interactions I had with my co-workers. I liked being able to have a full-time job, with benefits, that didn't require me having to leave my home as we presently only have one vehicle in my household. Didn't care much for the lack of job stability, the project I was working on was slated to end with barely a month's notice because the company had lost the work from home contract that I was employed by. Overall good company had great benefits, but would be hesitant to accept another position from this firm, being that they aren't a direct hire organization."
good,"gave encouragement in learning the process and training conducted periodically."
good,"I enjoyed the culture at Convergys and miss the friends I had made while there."
good,"It's an awesome job because I'm a people person. I want everything in order and I want everyone happy right away. Although they requesting extensive Overtime, almost everyday, of about 5 hours is slowly killing us. They need manpower. (This only applies to our account, I'm sure others are O.K.)"
good,"On a typical work day at Convergys I took over 100 customer service calls. I took care of many customer issues such as billing, technical support, plan changes, and contract renewals. I learn more patience working here. The most enjoyable part of the job was ending a call with a satisfied customer. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers."
good,"Worked in various departments like recruitment, talent development. Senior Level & Lateral Hiring."
good,"Used to be shy person."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,I loved working with the technicians as well as the employees I worked with on a regular basis. The management was very hard to please at times due to some things never being enough for some of the management. Overall I really enjoyed working for Cisco through Convergys.
good,"I didn't really like the job, the people were nice, management was nice, and they had good security, I just felt miserable everyday I went."
good,"Convergys is in a state of constant change where your job perfomance decides whether you sink or swim. The pay is good or above average and there is plenty of overtime to be had but whether or not you will want it is another story. This is a call center where the main department is at&t calls from real and ""fake"" customers that test to see whether or not you can solve the problem by following their rules. Solving the problem without following their guide will count against you. Job can become tiresome or stressful depending on the type of calls you receive and the lack of training on certain devices and plans/packages/features will cause you not to want to stay for long. About 6 months in and I'm ready to move on. Look for this as a stepping stone or a gateway into another job with similar pay/benefits."
good,"working with co-workers , learning everyday, making transactions and helping customers ."
good,The company offers its employees some form of leisure to create work-life balance. An example is its tie-up with a major fitness company which offered Convergys employees discounted enrollment fees.
good,"Typical day : Assessment test"
good,"Good place to start a career, Good management and great on the floor perks. Training could be a little better but job is self explanatory. Co-workers are great focused on the job. Most enjoyable thing is the the schedules."
good,"A typical day at work includes a high volume of phone calls and faxes from patients, pharmacies, and doctor's offices trying to complete prior authorizations for medications. In order to perform well on the job you learn to multitask very well by using multiple computer programs as well as operating j-phones. While doing your job you're surrounded by hundreds of coworkers whom are also trying to talk on the phone so therefore the workplace is noisy. However, the most enjoyable part of working in this call center is learning about many different prescription drugs and their purposes."
good,Management skills and human behavior.cooperation and team building.coordination between different departments.Organisatonal development and culture.
good,"I made a lot of good friends at this job. Many people had the same sense of humour and personality as me so it made it great to come into work everyday. Things were great until they started trying to change things, like our schedules-from normal workable hours to midnights, or late/too early shifts. People with children and people that didn't own cars were hit the hardest. Taxis to pick you up from the Square were late a lot. We used to only deal with emails from customers then they implemented phone service. Many people started losing their jobs. As with any job I noticed a problem with romantic relationships between coworkers, but they would get so bad that people would lose their jobs because of the drama."
good,"good and fun and flexible."
good,Been a long time since i worked there but left the company before some major org. and policy changes.
good,convergys consisted of speaking to customers over a phone to help resolve internet issue. i learned the basic and advanced steps for troubleshooting internet issues. the management at convergys showed a lot of favoritism. the co-workers that i had where extremely unprofessional except for a select few. the hardest part of the job was resolving the issue without actually being able to whats wrong
good,Exciting start in a new office for a new product.  The company provided customer support for XM Radio when the service was first introduced.
good,The hardest part about this job was people yelling at you on the phone. The most enjoyable part was helping others. It always made me feel good when someone said I am very greatful for your help.
good,Company has gone through many corporate and managerial changes. Habitually outsources work and reduces US staff.
good,AT&T is all sales didn't really enjoy the At&t customer service due to so much information and plans changing all the time new upgrades. was starting to get used to it though. Can't miss too many hours though because of point system and if you go over the amount no matter what the issue is your let go.
good,Loved my boss and my co-workers.  Stressful and little time to be effective with customers.
good,A typical day would handle approxmiately 30 calls a day.  Department provided incentatives.
good,"It was a phone job on the Directv project. Of course you will have upset customers, and that is fine, however when a customer calls in because their bill went up $50 dollars and they were promised it would not, it's hard to tell them that there's nothing you can do about it."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,I did not have a manager in house to assist with my development.  The three direct managers within 3 months were all virtual.  I struggled with learning the client's objectives and would have had an easier time had the management been onsite.
good,"The hours were terrible, the training needed fine tuning, management was pretty much nonexistent, the pay was okay."
good,"Good environment with nice people around, lots to learn and not so great management."
good,The most difficult part of this job is dealing with the immaturity of management and anyone in a leadership position.  I do believe that this is what is driving people away from this company.  They need to take a hard look at everyone and everything and re- evaluate their current situation before anything gets any better
good,The typical day at work is easy but very repetitive. While working for the company I leaned to handle different types of people with different health issues.
good,"A typical day at work starts at 8:00 am.I work in a  very busy and multilingual office."
good,It was a very laid back job and it was for the most part enjoyable but management was for the most part hectic.
good,"Although the work was enjoyable, the management was prone to changing things randomly and without warning the agents, and then disciplining them when they were unable to adapt."
good,"Stressful day of work. Learned how to better handle stress. Coworkers were great, hardest part of the job were the callers. The most enjoyable part of it was that the ride home for a rest well earned. Management did great in scheduling workers on the floor"
good,"Like any job, sometimes you have good and sometimes bad days"
good,"overtime is not only completely available it it often required by all employees. this is a great place to work if you are looking to make extra money and have a steady income . however the days are long, the environment is very gossipy , and the managers and or supervisors are rude and unknowledgeable "
good,"Greet customers over the phone; explain products and services "
good,"From the minute I stepped in the door I loved the company, the work and the people. I was promoted to TM as soon as I was past the 6 months wait period after hire and was very proud. Everyone was wonderfully encouraging and positive. I found in the end that the team manager position, though incredibly rewarding, was not structured and in my effort to find order in disorder I found that the work/life balance was not possible after a year of excessive overtime resulting in my departure."
good,Typical collections company with all the good and the bad. Management is closed knitted so not as much opportunity to move up
good,Enjoyed the time at this position but it was closed. It was a typical call center with phones ringing off the hook and a pleasant atmosphere
good,"You must keep current with the constant changes in handling procedures, prices, and products.  However, I enjoyed my co - workers and team leads."
good,"I dislike working on weekends but with the benefits, its worth it"
good,Typical work day consisted of answering calls of patients while providing a calming solution driven rep to any of their needs. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting patients with their medical needs.
good,Very diverse working environment where you can meet and work with people with different cultures from all around the glob.  It provides excellent experience.
good,"Great place to work with customers , time restraints and expectations of management was unrealistic, Learning new things daily and finding answers with confidence when one has no idea what they are doing. Challenging for researching answers and keeping customers happy while floor walkers would nag you on time , eleven minutes you fixed the issue reviewed the customers account and sold them something new  or scheduled a truck call for a broken internet."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Work at home position that required you to set aside office space of your own at home, good support from fellow co-workers and team leads,"
good,"This job is pretty laid back all I do is sit on the phone all day and take incoming calls, I get incentive bonus for sales. The only inconvenient thing is traveling back and forth from where I stay and I work full work. I live in Tifton but I work in Valdosta and it's hard to keep traveling back and forth and spend so much money on gas but other than that its a great benefits job lots of benefit just inconvenient for me. I'm looking for something more convenient in my area"
good,"its a Good BPO company for bachelor students."
good,"a place to make good money, not for someone who is used to interact with people in person."
good,"Great hours, great pay, management is the hardest part of the job."
good,"They have a lot of different projects here, which all pay different amounts, so it's kind of a toss up going in what you're going to make. You'll come in to interview for one thing and get hired for another."
good,Good company to work for. I learned a lot about the campaign I was assigned to and they will help me in my personal life as well.
good,you dont get to have a life. they work on a point system and if  you have an emergency even if are in the emergency room you still acquire points. okay place to work the management does help you if you need help. the opportunity to grow and advancement opportunities are there but they put  pressure on you to please customers with metrics that you have no affect on like ratings for the company itself and if this is the first time calling affects you
good,"Decent training, you receiver good knowledge on how to use everything. However, schedule changes happen a lot without notification. You make commission on what you sell."
good,"Worked as a Technical Support Agent with the Direct TV Project, took calls on a daily basis, and assisted customers with technical problems with Direct TV, handled billing and scheduled services to the customers."
good,"My program was more detailed than most, so the knowledge share was quite extensive.  This knowledge I will use to spring into a more lucrative position outside the company.  Perfect position for someone looking for a secure income."
good,"Prepared food with a deep fryers and maintained beverage machines."
good,"A typical day at work, is sitting at a desk on the phone assisting clients. Since working there, I have learned how to service clients over the phone and how to deal with them as well. The co-workers we always willing to help if I needed any help or had any questions. The hardest part of the job would have to be assisting difficult clients."
good,"- Typically taking calls to troubleshoot customer's cable services."
good,"A typical day at work would involve processing all service orders and telephone complaints of customers. Assisting customers with ordering new service and adding on new features."
good,"The workplace was nice, it was a secured building with plenty of parking. There was a lot of team building such as pot lucks and activities. There was a 10 cent raise for every 500 hours of call time. So it was very easy to move up the chain in pay rate"
good,"A typical day at work is constant calls and a lot of thinking. I've learned how to trouble multiple services. HSI, cable, and phone. I am considered a Customer Service & Problem Resolution Rep. The hardest part of my job is trying and keeping the customers calm and just keeping the customer happy and let the customer vent to me. The most enjoyable part of my job is some of my co-workers and some of the costumers."
good,"no time to make friends, super fast paced. The training really makes a difference"
good,"Its good to work here, co-workers are friendly, and enjoying the work. Now I know how to work in a corporate environment. We have a cricket team, football team, and many other sports activities in our office, employee appreciation day, and many more, so in total its a learning experience, and fun too. But the problem in this industry is, if the process is gone, its difficult to continue in the company. Company is giving job security, but still, need to find out better option for a life long career."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes!

good,i learned alot about the indrive program and how it works. the more i learned the more i was able to provide the customers with efficient information
good,"Normal workflow,"
good,"At work, most of the employees and managers act professional. There are a few people that do not follow company rules that do not get in trouble. I did learn how to help customers with their problems by using the tools provided. The hardest part of the job is navigating their computer systems. I really enjoyed being able to help people with their problems."
good,good security compensation not great overall a good company to work for
good,"Agent Standpoint:"
good,This company has good incentives to try to keep their employees. The work schedules are very strict. The hours offered did not work well for my life schedule. Taking calls to resolve issues with AT&T customer devices or accounts. Most co-workers were very nice.
good,The company values its employees a lot but is very strict when it comes to discipline and targets. You will surely learn a lot
good,"Stress free environment, but it is much too slow and boring for me. Management does not communicate that well. My co-workers are amazing and extremely friendly and helpful."
good,"I worked in a call center. My job was to take payments for customers accounts, explains bill and adjust when needed, trouble shoot phones, and fill out correct paper work. The most important part of the job was to sell U verse. If you didn't meet your quota you would be fired even during holidays when business slowed down."
good,"I have been with Netcracker from the last 6 years and got to work extensively on STPI communication cafeteria managment ."
good,"Learnt team work, Got strong in verbal as well as written communication skills, Learnt to achieve targets. "
good,"Here, a typical day at work would be up to 80 inbound calls per day . highly queueing especially during  holiday season. Health care professionals would call to inquire about the customer's benefits and also about the doctor/facility claims which are computed based on their individual contracts. The management is very supportive and gives a lot of incentives for recognized individuals. My co- workers are fun to be with and are very helpful in all ways possible. The hardest part of the job would be attending to seemingly endless number of calls per day. Everyday would be high volume to the point that the after call work should be less than 2 min per month . The job itself is very demanding too, metrics are difficult to achieve and because i handles an additional product it is sometimes confusing and really complicated. On the other hand the most enjoyable part of the job is having to experience being complimented not only by the clients  but also the management themselves. I also enjoyed participating in different activities"
good,"Everything was a new day at this company, alot of learning. Everything I personally learned started from here, the management is good & chances of being a part of it = amazing!  The company's culture was really bad due to extremely poor hiring standards which ended up costing company it's physical locations & they closed down US locations but kept work-from-home positions opened."
good,This job requires a plethora of patience. It is very difficult especially when you have your supervisors and their supervisors on top of you 24/7. Its wasn't right for me.
good,The company is okay was making more on the floor than managers.
good,"Creating service requests for existing partners"
good,"A typical day at Convergy's was lets see who makes more sales and has more incoming calls. I learned how to solve a lot of computer functions, fix tv cables, do bundle sales. Co-workers were all in their own little world. Hardest part of the job was not being able to solve a problem and have a dissapointed customer on the other end of the line. The enjoyable part was when all my tasks were done and my supervisor would praise us by say good job guys."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,A typical day involves a lot of phone activity. There is a lot to remember. The hardest part of the job was you did not have a set schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job is you get to engage in conversation with many different types of people both on the phone and co-workers.
good,"This job was a great introduction to me relating to telemarketing and taking in-bound sale calls. I worked 9:30am to 6:00pm most of the time from Mon-Friday while overtime was not required. I worked with my personally team and team leader, always trying to perform and surpass the other teams having fun while doing so. Everyday was very repetitive but I learned something new everyday because I was willing to learn new techniques to always improve myself and my team. Generally dealt with older clients who cannot or have issues with their bills via; internet, phone and television. Some clients who call in are very calm but most are angry and are confused or frustrated. My job was to disarm clients and smoothly take care of the related problem in a good timely matter. When issues and questions were resolved, I would transition into sales with common sense or knowledge, but will always attempt to sell a product. Willing to consistently train about improving one self or learning new products. Become flexible with new or a change work schedule was also required which I had no problems with during my stay with Convergys. Some accomplishments I received working the short 6-7 months I there, was being recognized with a certificate of outstanding performance. I was also awarded a $200 incentive bonus or a Kindle fire HD by an unlimited entry raffle drawing contest with most sales in the month."
good,"a typical day at work includes talking on the phone to customers about their daily cable and internet issues. the hardest part of the job was the training you had to suck in so much, at so little time. the most enjoyble part is ending a call knowing that i satisfied everyone of my customers needs."
good,"Fast pace work place where calls are back to back eight hours out the day. Convergys is a third party vendor who works for at&t, apple, charter, etc I learned how to handel high call volume, learned how to do tech support and billing for customer accounts, management is can be helpful to a point. Need to focus on how to get everyone work as a team instead of threating peoples job. My co workers are amazing I have made many new friends at work because every six months we bid for diferent teams so you meet more new people. The hardest part of the day is when a customer calls in with a technical issue or something wrong with their bill and I have done all I can and the customer issue is still not fix and Im unable to further assist adn have to do a case for the issue to get fix because then I will get a bad survey for something that I am not in controll of. The enjoyable part of the day is being able to resolve my customers issue."
good,"Convergys is a very fast paced international company. It provides personnel and technologies for Customer Management companies around the world. I have worked on multiple projects for multiple clients taking inbound customer service calls to help their customers manage various aspects of their personal accounts. You have to be prepared to multi-task - we use many different computer programs and resources to gain information an make account changes to assist our customer. You have to be flexible, all big business is ever changing and you have to be prepared for anything and everything. On a call where you can tell the customer you are assisting is earnestly in need and appreciative of your help, it can be very rewarding. On the downside, the customers who need you the most are generally angry because they have had to take the time to call in and/ or have reasons to be disgruntled and those customer interactions can be frequent, and very challenging. If you feel that you are prepared to embracing those challenges and have the skills and patience to solve such problems for people, this could be a rewarding career for you."
good,A great company to work for with a diversed environment. You learn new things each day with high exspectations.
good,good place to lear nice co workers enjoyable job no hardest parts in job
good,"A typical day at work consists of taking customer calls regarding their cellphone issues and resolving the issues for them. At this job I learned that working independently with customers was rewarding. The hardest part of this job was the time spent just sitting in one place for hours at a time when call volume was low. It was difficult because I had to sit and stay there to wait for a call to come in, when I couldn't help feeling as tho my time would be better spent helping others on their calls."
good,"Honestly, if you want to advance, you'll have to be there for a good long time. Oh, and there are no raises."
good,answered phones very busy work place my co workers really good friendly people there really wasnt a hard part of my job the most enjoyed part of the job was knowing the customer was satified at the ebd of the call and day
good,you wok on computer all day talking to client its a lot of females that start things is best to stay to yourself. You dont get a extra money unless you meet your goals so the pay you start wih you leave with.
good,This was a seasonal position for me. Seasonals are constantly reminded of the temporary nature of their position and punished for asking too many questions of supervisors. I did learn to overcome objections and stand my ground.
good,"good to work with, management biased to some extent, employees are hard working."
good,It was great to work from home.
good,"i apllied to this job from working at a casino working mid nights decided needed a chane wasnt sure what i was going into, ended up being a call center , i am a fast paced worker who loves to keep moving this job intaled sitting in a chair at a computer answering phones , job wasnt for me but was an excellent work enviornment ."

good,Good place to work and learn
good,You have to remain calm and resolve the account. Try to be understanding and help the best way you can.
good,Not a bad place to work. They however put to much importance on selling instead of helping customers.
good,Convergys is a great starting place to gain experience in call center work.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"great job while in college, handled customers and trouble shooting problems. co-workers were great."
good,Call Center Enivornment
good,Worked in a call center envrionment for state workers in state jobs. I learned to work the state systems using the SAP program. The management was great and i still stay in touch with my co-workers. The hardest part of this job was learning the SAP program for the state. It was just a relaxed atmosphere.Worked twice for them the second time was just temporary
good,"Trabalhei por um ano com chefes bons e salario mais ou menos. os beneficios tambem agradaveis, so que e dificiu de subir."
good,"A lot of jobs are filled from outside the company, many were not even advertised for open positions within the company."
good,Working in Convergys is tiring but it is also Fun. The whole management team are very supportive to every agents. The management gives a lot of motivational things that will help Improve the moral and as well as the work habits of every agent.
good,Management would often put on games and competitions with money rewards throughout the week. The work was relatively easy.
good,Convergys was a very good company to work for the only thing that was an issue were the managers and the customers. Some of the managers would not help you with some questions you would have about the product and trainers would only show you 10 minutes videos for a whole 8 hour shift.
good,This company is considered very good experience for someone looking to move up. The salary is not the best in the market.
good,"typical day at work would be to come in early to set up and make sure that you have all the major screens ready for your first customer call, putting in your pass words, assist the customers with their billing issues, cell phone plans issues, try to meet the team's quota for the day, with ethics and values, honesty and with the customers best interest at heart, not to just make a sale."
good,"Typical day is chatting with customers on the internet regarding services. I learned almost all of my customer service and salesmanship from this company. Co-workers were friendly, sarcastic, and usually overweight. Hardest part of the job was to focus on the job itself and not get distracted with the internet. Enjoyable part was that I was able to do school work."
good,"Research cases, see if customers vehicles are in or out of warranty or Service contracts. then make a decision of assisting with goodwill repairs or being an advocate for warranty work or complaints. the hardest part is telling some one you cannot help them. the most enjoyable part is helping someone in need."
good,"Working in a call center has enhanced my experience resolving customer's issues in an ever changing environment. Self adjustments are needed and have to be applied to every situations while sustaining professional communication between myself, the customer, co-workers and management. Nothing is more satisfying than engaging with others and closing your day with satisfactory status on all levels. Constant feedback from customers, co-workers and management to improve your self worth."
good,taking phone calls and helping customers with questions and concerns.
good,It teaches you alot about technolgy how how computer are very important in this world.
good,This company has an extremely high turn over rate which is always reflective of management.. They were paid per seat training which was an encompassing 6 wk course.
good,It is a great company to gain customer service experience. Helps you develop new skills that will help you in any other future careers.
good,"I personally found it okay, I worked in sales though which I found hard as this was my first time working in this industry. Management were lovely as well and the staff. Did find a lot of people struggling as well as myself and a lot of issues without that campaign I was in but the company Concentrix was great. Lovely canteen staff stc"
good,"From the day of Interview till last day of Work, Concentrix can be termed as Employee friendly company with the policies it has. But the work culture support on job depends on the Management over there. Where i can give it a score of 5/10 for Management at Thane location."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Environment, culture and people are fun to work with. Learn necessary skills to develop yourself and work with others. Must be willing to work hard to move up in the company and show your value."
good,"Well I loved working for this company, as I worked for this company before, under AT&T. And just like AT&T, the campaign I am now working on, is no longer working with concentrix, and March 26th 2020 will my last day of employment."
good,"Trabajar con Nike fue sencillo. El sistema era agradable y la mayoria de los clientes eran simpaticos, sin embargo el ambiente laboral era un poco hostil."
good,"The management is flexible and fair. They will help you to reach your target and bring new solutions to help you with it."
good,"Overall not a bad place to work, there are opportunities to earn comission and progress if you put the work in. The people who work there also means you can have a laugh at work too."
good,Everyone was there who graduated with me. The fights were even the same. Glad they changed things up. No more convergys. Hopefully it's more professional.
good,I have realy learned a lot from Convergys. I would not be able to achieve the skills that I have now without my employment with them. Very good training.
good,It's a good step especially if you're not experienced yet in the industry. that's all that I can think of. I am blessed that I was under their google account which has a totally different location from the rest of their account.
good,"Know how to handle calls and be punctual all the times."
good,We are providing the troubleshooting  steps to customer and clarifying the customer query and assisting the customer in a best way and recommending the service
good,"Company is solid, but I don’t think they pay what the job is worth."
good,"This is a fast paced, very customer and business oriented work place. You have to be good at time management, customer skills, and have technical knowledge of the product. Also need to be able to handle difficult customers and situations effectively."
good,My time at Concentrix was short because it just wasn’t for me . They job is not a bad job at all i enjoyed my time there but somethings just aren’t for everyone. I disliked some of the rules applied especially the cell phone rule . I understand the not having them in production but in the classroom was kind of outrageous. No information in the classroom was personal patient information so i was no need to not have phone
good,The job was good. I just wasn't fan of the work environment other than that solid job. I big plus is the pay and the flexible hours. I saw some co-workers show up on their own schedule.
good,"Good working condition my co workers were are respectful and awesome working hours were not flexible. the place against all reviews before is clean, but you can feel lack of management on that but its not a big problem because your leads will always there for you and your problems."
good,"I love my work, I love my Job but I don't want the management due to certain circumstances of work locations and benefit. Our benefits got lessen & chances of yearly performance increase DECREASED due to the fact that your company purchased a much bigger company and budget is now allotted to 80,000+ employees. I"
good,Good organisation to start your career. Your experience depends on which process you're working and on your supervisor too. Limited options of working from home
good,"It is becoming a very employee friendly place to work. They have Monday Munchies and have multiple opportunities to have company wide events. They have a week of dress up days, Christmas parties, Easter get together, Fourth of July party. It is a good place to be but you have to watch out for your points."
good,Team leaders started out on the phone so they know how it feels to be really busy and understand if you want or need an extra break. If you don't do it every day
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Pros: nice staff "
good,"I would work with 7 different metric that would have to meet standards. Deescalate upset customers and help customers out the best you can, while giving the correct information. I was in the retention department so I would have to fix problems as well as entice customers to not leave with offers our system would show on customers page, only if they were in good rating in our system others wise. I would also have to speak with Team Lead about certain cases and negotiate what and why i feel the customer deserves. If you do not save customers it does count against you."
good,Concentrix was a awesome place to work the employee were friendly and helpful management not so much but it is a simple job wit opportunity of advancement
good,"There is no work-life balance, sometimes you have to work more than 9 hours. If you are a fresher in any field then this company can give you a good start and also the salary is not that less for a fresher but as the time passes, you will realize the money is really low compared to the hard work you do. If you are fresher and got no direction, you can definitely give a try to this company. I loved my job here, if you are giving a try to this company then all the best to you and do something for this company when you have time because this will be your second home in a short time."
good,The job is great when all thing work and the customer allow us the time it takes to complete the deal.  It takes at least 3 weeks to complete the process and sometime longer depending on some unforeseen problems.  The problems cause the customers to become upset with the workers.
good,"You can snack whenever you want and you get long hours which means higher pay, and everyone there is super friendly. However, you barely feel like you have a life and its hard to get a decent shift that you actually like because only people who were actually there for a while getting the upper hand in bidding for shifts. Also, if you advance to a higher department, the pay barely goes up"
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job was learning and meeting new people/coworkers. Helping new agents getting on to the floor."
good,Worked for spectrum cable worse project ever.  Never met the client expect to much for not enough pay that they give. Not organize get tired of lieing to the cx about their services
good,"They have many opportunities within the company but you have to express your interest in them."
good,"I was hired with Convergys which has been bought by Concentrix year 2018. Convergys provides employees good compensation, fortunately Concentrix didn't make it less. They provide quality training for employees too."
good,"great team leaders willing to help as much as needed. very high call volume leaving little time to prepare notes before next call comes in, short breaks and lunch"
good,Numerous large accounts with both company and client presence.  Type of account determines hours of operation.  Potential for overtime.  Management opportunities.
good,It's a cool laid back job with your typical day being working with customer's with their phones and computers. Just expect to be forced to go into other lines of business whether you want to or not. Some of the managers don't really care about you. Their shift bids are ridiculous and their benefits suck. They cater a lot which is awesome and the overall job is easy with you being able to wear pretty much whatever you want as long as it's not offensive. Everyone I work with is wonderful.
good,"I worked at Concentrix for about 2 years and it always felt like a very hostile work environment. There was no sense of community, the management always approached things as if they were out for blood. I do not recommend."
good,"I was usually involved in many large projects and at same time dealing with daily building issues, staff, and equipment issues. Some days were really intense. "
good,"Working for Convergys was better than some jobs that I have had, but not as good as others. I didn't hat working there, but neither did I love it. I really liked some of the people that I worked with."
good,"While I loved some aspects, like my direct bosses, and those I worked with. I had other issues with the overall company. While employees are expendable, and there will theoretically always be consumers for any given company, treating your employees and consumers as if they don't matter, while pushing for your employees to be the rising stars in compassion and what service really means, is not a company I would ever recommend to anymore, nor work for again."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,I'm going to say my experience is a bit jaded due to the location. This was one of the best jobs I had. It introduced me to management and has laid the foundation for my call center management career. The biggest issue I had was with my pay.
good,Learnt more about the technically specifications with products. The enjoyable part of the job was gaining more experience with empathy and communication skills. Also i made a lot of new friends within my work.
good,It was a very solid place to work. Though the benefits could have been better and we got no raises. My fellow co-workers made it an enjoyable place to work.
good,"*Busy but manageable"
good,"I worker on escalation team handling advanced technical issues dealing with internet phone and cable.  It was a busy job, helping solve customer's calls the whole shift."
good,"Assist customers with home equipment trouble-shooting, warranty replacements.  Sales support via incoming phone calls re. Products by Newell Rubbermaid."
good,I enjoy the variety of calls that flow through my day from navigation calls to helping with the crisis calls.  Having fellow employees close by for assistance if needed helps team building and having team leaders available to give us a hand makes it easier to deal with the day to day issues that may arise.
good,It was pretty good overall. First job and first time trained for specific roll in a work place but it was really well done and structured. I felt ready when I was placed on my own.
good,Many employees were promoted in this fast paced environment when additional supervisory skills were needed. Preferential treatment was frequently observed to no avail. Dissension was created between supervisors and employees.
good,"The other staff was amazing, however some calls got overwhelming and hard to deal with on a daily basis. The pay was okay but co workers made it good."
good,"As an HR trainee, I was exposed to multiple aspects of the recruitment and selection process. Good teams and good work culture. The managers are very approachable and provide excellent guidance throughout."
good,"Your life will become revolves around this job! Good pay, good benefits, but a very demanding and stressful job! They push you to sale ! And they will fire you!"
good,"Stressful but I loved the job. the benefits are great however, the pay is questionable. Since I left the pay scale has been changed for bonuses. I'm unsure if the pay scale would be to my benefit now"
good,"Convergys was okay. The metrics were more obtainable than any other call center I've ever worked at, but I personally just don't enjoy the work - I just needed a check at the time. Super easy to get hired. There's no windows and the break room is like a detention center, so it's a tad bit depressing. But it's connected to an old mall, so there's some restaurants outside of the facility."
good,"Convergys Corporation is a corporation based in Cincinnati, Ohio, that sells customer management and information management products, primarily to large corporations. Customer management products include agent assisted, self-service and care software tailored to the communications, financial services, technology, retail, healthcare and government markets."
good,"Convergys. Infinys Rating and Billing (IRB), Dynamic Decisioning Solution (DDS), ICOMS, Customer Management, Solutions etc. Convergys Corporation is a corporation based in Cincinnati, Ohio, that sells customer management and information management products, primarily to large corporations."
good,"Although I don't think Concentrix is operating with General motors anymore. While I worked there it was fun, the supervisors were nice and helpful the work environment was great there was events and other customer benefits that came with working there."
good,Good to get some call center experience but they don't pay the best. Their computers need to be upgraded they are old. Excellent management and training.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Convergys used Proprietary software for the travel industry.  The hardest part of the job was understanding the Travel Software.  Unfortunately it was not the most User Friendly Software I have worked with.
good,Good people to work but for me the management was poor well the manger I had was she never stook to what converges told her to do and had no empathy towards her team and when you wanted help she was never there.
good,"My work here usually starts at midnight, i take billing and technical in-bound calls from DirecTV subscribers all over Northern America. It was fun talking to all sorts of people with their issues. I was able to enhance my English conversational skills more than i expected. The management provides unlimited free coffee (because sometimes we go to work without enough sleep). We technically had this chatroom for all agents per team where we can chat with our colleagues and tell our strangest problems with our callers. We have our own jargon and people outside the place raise their eyebrows whenever they hear us. It's basically tough to deal with elder callers. You have to exert a lot of effort to talk to them repeatedly and slowly as you can which makes you call time matrix in danger. I love it whenever i resolved all billing issues and customers give me a 100% satisfaction rate."
good,"I learned a lot from the managers within Convergys including how to run a team."
good,"•	Undergone training in Microsoft Operating Systems Windows from 2007 up to Windows 10 versions. "
good,The location is near from home. Good working environment and people to work with however not substantial for an employee to stay longer in the company.
good,"Everything is working fine until someone came and I felt the management was changed. But, I know he is doing the right things, I just felt the pressure, it is too much already. But, all in all Convergys is a good company of you want some callcenter experience."
good,"Friendly environment training rooms are very conducive for learning trainers are awesome, the offices, rest rooms and sleep lounge are very clean and tidy."
good,This company provides excellent customer service to different clients. It's a good call center company and provides good training to agents. They also value  work life balance.
good,"Not a bad place to work if you don't mind feeling chained to a cubicle everyday, its a typical call center. The pay is ok for certain projects, plus bonuses."
good,"Zeit für Veränderung "
good,"The location of the job is too far from home, engaging with too much traffic causes late"
good,"Convergys is a vendor for several companies, FedEx, Blue Cross Blue Shield, RCI. I worked for FedEx side of the building. A typical day a Convergys consist of tracking packages, creating cases for lost packages, filing claims and assisting customers with customizing their delivery options. I also worked for the Technical Support side of FedEx. The tech support side of things is assisting customers with troubleshooting the FedEx website. With the website you will assist customers with creating their own shipping labels, viewing invoices online, requesting reports and creating international documents for their own shipments. I've used different applications to assist customers with troubleshooting technical issues such as configuring and installing printers and drivers, installing and downloading Ship Manager Software system for shipping, and assisting customers with importing and exporting their database info for shipping. If you like helping customers with resolving issues and problem solving and can defuse customers this is a good position that is also fast paced and has a very high call volume"
good,"It was a good Learning experience the job is definitely not for everybody, you need a lot of patience, and very good people in customer service skills."
good,Wasn't the best place if it worked management and work environment was very nice is everything that a call center should be fast pace and goal oriented
good,"I worked on 3 different accounts for Convergys, AT&T Wireless Long Distance, Sunbeam/Oster, and Charter Cable."
good,"This was a Seasonal Remote position with a set schedule.  It was assigned to you, you could not pick the hours you worked.  Very fast paced due to the time of the year."
good,Call centers have a record but for many people to know... The management here are amazing and very friendly. They will fight for you when you need them and trust me... You'll need them at some point.
good,Its an okay place to work. Teamwork is awesome. Just wish the pay was better. Always willing to help. I totally love the power half hours and the training is fairly easy.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,I learned a lot about how to handle irate clients. At first you'll feel the pressure of resolving it but when you're already used to it basically you will know how to cater these kinds of problems and people.
good,Answering calls and fixing customer's internet connection. I have learned a lot about internet connections especially when fixing internet problems and so on
good,"Overall a great place to work, good location and the training provided is of a high standard. Computer systems work well and are efficient and easy to use."
good,"Typical day at work is to login and take in calls."
good,"Good managers but with all the jobs getting shipped overseas, basically no room for advancement. Depending on how well you manage customer service, some days can be amazing, other days can be horrible. It is basically just a dead end job while you try to find a good job."
good,"It is a good company. Security of the employees is always first. With regards to HR management, I am not really in to it because they do not tend to help their employees with a graceful manner."
good,job was a descent place to work. regular day was answering phone and solving billing questions. I learned to be more patient. the culture at the job was laid back and nice. management was ok to work for. The hardest part about job was the systems problems for the computer. The most enjoyable part about the job was the people
good,"On the Chrysler Case Management project, management was not always available when needed and we were not able to disconnect with customers who were verbally abusive without management approval. The work load was very fast-paced and overwhelming though manageable when assistance was available as needed."
good,"Has great pay and plenty of overtime, so if you are wanting to make monew it's a great place. My manager was awesome and really worked with me when my children were sick."
good,The only thing I had to complain with was the training everything is outdated and makes it hard but the job was nice. And they had expensive lunch but that was it.
good,"Convergys is an interesting and fairly relaxed place to work although the occasional client/caller could be difficult and hard to please making the call very stressful.  Frequently I agreed with the caller's feeling of being cheated by the company but was both unable to tell them that or do anything to help them."
good,It was many years ago that I worked for Convergys.  Working for a company that specializes in providing outsourced contact center support for large and medium-sized companies was stressful and challenging.  I didn't feel that the compensation matched the level of stress and effort required to be successful.
good,Job security is only guaranteed if you are friends with the higher ups.  Otherwise it is a mere warm spot until you can do better or they decide to let you go.
good,"A typical day at work included showing up at your scheduled shift time, logging into the phones and then taking calls. I learned a lot about the grand scheme of businesses and how they operated working for this company. Management is fine, some better than others just like any other place. The work culture was very competitive but also rewarding. Of course you have to meet metrics and goals that have been set forth, but if it is something that comes natural to you then you might be able to succeed in this environment. The hardest part of the job was maintaining goals and metrics with the unpredictable nature of customers and which services (satellite TV, cable, or streaming services like Netflix) they preferred."
good,I liked the job I did for Concentrix. It was fun but the pay was so low that I felt like I got paid in food and travel and was never really appreciated. I was also told that I would get Hired on after 6 months at there parent company but that never happened and  when I finally told them I had to move on the sent me to the man Concentrix office. Which was a 100 percent on the phones cold calls. This job depends on what department you get. So. Good luck with that.
good,Loved talking with customers on phone. Limited time you are allowed on phone per customer. Must suggest internet/phone service/upgrade tv service every call even if customer is calling to complain about prices.
good,"This is a great place to work if there is a management team that keeps the people motivated and happy, however, it can be stressful if management does not know what they are doing. "
good,The job was mostly from customers who were upset that their bill was too high or they had questions about the plans provided new equipment or new kinds of services provided. It is very stressful and I believe it is the reason I had to deliver my son early as my placenta became detached. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I work with.
good,"The location of the office is close to many typical transportation. Many dormitories, restaurants, shopping malls and other needed stores are close to the office. It is a night shift job."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"If you are able to handle high stress, a culture were you can quickly become just a number, and the ""buck"" is easily pass, then you can do  well. On the flip-side you can develop some really close friendships with  emaplyess and managment, but you have to be careful who you confide in."
good,"Generally a well rounded job good for the time but not a second one, would rather work somewhere where I can move up in the company and not have to wait."
good,This job was for teenagers that graduated or still in school and the dress code was not appropriate for the environment. The manager's are great and very helpful and training was great.
good,"Before it was Datacom was purchased by Convergys it was really an amazing place, I wouldnt have resigned if it was not moved to another location. Best of luck"
good,I Really Didn't like Working Their It's Ghetto The People Is Very Rude Disrespectful Team Members Are Not Helpful at all I Only stayed There For 6 months It's unorganized Things didn't go as I Planned They have Great pay & Good benefits
good,The job itself at the time was very easy.  Worked on a great team after a 13 week training.  Benefits are offered and the pay was okay to start and I received a cost of living raise at the beginning of the following year.
good,"a typical day in a call center, the management could have been a little better. The hours and compensation was great, although the company Convergys was a bit unorganized. Paypal was a very beneficial company to work for."
good,"I was not able to work really long at this company, although my experience when i was working here, i was really stressed. And I was not really happy."
good,"The people there are generally great. Theres a cafe where you can get food, video games in the break room upstairs, and a nap room down stairs. The training is generally thorough. Their used to be job security, but these days i doubt theyll still be there another 2 years. They lost 3 of i think 5 contracts this year alone and management is top heavy. Theyre flexible if they like you though."
good,Convergys was a great place to work. I worked for the prior company before Convergys and stayed on. I received my beginning in call center mgmt. there which afforded me to obtain the position at Citi. I didn't leave Convergys intentionally. At the time our department closed down and there was no other choice.
good,"The management team and coworkers were fantastic. the job of processing medical insurance claims was tedious, and high-stress. i would recommend the position for those that are computer literate and do not mind staring at a computer screen for multiple hours at a time."
good,"This job is truly what you make it. I enjoyed my time there, but would never go back after being laid off for making too much. Other people completely hate it, to each their own."
good,"Very relaxed workplace culture  and competitive salary incentives"
good,A mix of advanced technical support via chat and speaking with customer's over the phone. I worked in the social media department which required us to make outbound calls as well as chat with the customer (their preference). Worked with a great team!
good,"Some very good management and some bad apples."
good,All is going good no need to change anything. There strict rule which is good for the company. All colleagues are very supportive and concentrix has set a mark for bpos.
good,People here are great.  Its a fund and productive environment.  The work environment is great with a full service café.  Fun clients to work with and clients are invested to help agents succeed.
good,I loved my job there..However there was too much favoritism going on  to get advancements.. the people I worked with are great..I had  great boss.. He did whatever he could to help me
good,"Converges is an enjoyable workplace there are many friendly, nice people who communicate with each other. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to give advice and help to people."
good,"I joined this organization as Team Leader Operations for Microsoft program in year 2003 and currently working as Senior Operations Manager. Hardest part of job is doing night shifts since most of my clients are doing US shifts, rest everything else is good."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"some of he people who work there are aggressive and sarcastic, his company would be better if hey had a better more professional building and a no to ""highschool"" setting"
good,"A good  organisation to uplift your carrer but long working hours , schedule is very hectic. You get to learn a lot from the team leader and also can get some extra knowledge and help yourself to learn something new from the concentrix e-learning tool so that it can help you keep growing in the oraganisation. You get a nice environment to work for plus the security is also tight, you can feel safe inside the office but the transport facility is not at all so good because the transport department is not upto the mark."
good,"Convergys provides really good schedule flexibility but the management could really mess up the work environment of an agent, but overall a really good place to work for any college students."
good,Answered calls dealing with AT&T bills. Mostly angry customers who accumulated charges and needed explaining. You definitely have to have great customer skills.
good,"You start with a pre-shift meeting which is great to know what has changed or new expectations.  Although monitored heavily, most leadership works to develop and make you better.  There are times where mandatory overtime is expected. Good leaders make the job fun and help eliminate the stress."
good,Training at Convergy's could be much better. The biggest problem is the equipment repeatedly breaking down. There is little time to catch up. It causes you to miss training.  How people feel about Convergy's can affect your personal rating because Convergy's did not have a separate company rating . The time on a call can be affected by company equipment breaking down. That takes away from your performance score.
good,"Convergys is a fun place to work for.  Convegys is busy throughout the day depending on client. I've learned social, management and training skills. Managers are willing to help and will listen to any situation you may have. Workplace culture is extremely diverse and you don't have to worry about discrimination. The hardest part of the job is dealing with co-workers who are immature. I enjoyed meeting new people and being able to establish forever relationships with others."
good,"wasn't always the support you needed...Just made you go out on your own and find the answers..which makes you a better agent"
good,"great company but,less communication with the employees,....i learned a lot there, workplace is great but the management is not that transparent to there employees"
good,"Working full time with technical support and customer service. Fast paced environment, challenging incentives, and training on the latest technological software for wireless support."
good,Button taking phone calls all day this can be the great job for you but be warned if you don't hit metrics even once they will never let you live it down even if you can get your stats up the next week it will continue to always follow you. Convergys is always looking for a Warm Bodies to fill positions though so easy place to get a job if you need one immediately
good,"Depending on the project, working for convergys can either be a typically difficult call center job, or it can be very high pressure sales oriented and overwhelminly stressful.  The one constant at Convergys is change; goals, processes, and standards for judging performance change often and unpredictably"
good,"On a daily basis this job was to stressful for me, The call type was not what I expected for the hourly pay. My co-workers and mangers however where very nice and helpful."
good,"Some system issues are inevitable leading to customer dissatisfaction. Most are dealt with unspecified reasons and, often vague ones. However, I can say that the company is truly efficient"
good,"I worked with the same company twice and the first time I worked with them it was a great experience. Although the program I am in was very demanding but I total understand it. However when I worked with them again in 2013 the experience was great at first not until when they acquired Stream Services, it seems that the company went down. My benefits was not affected, however then new hires we're the ones affected."
good,The workplace has diversity and the rules are pretty strict other than that they try to meet your needs and they work with you to move forward and the company
good,Training is lacking for the time given. Team members are VERY supportive.  Management has the problem of not knowing what other departments are doing.
good,This was a pretty ok job. My only problem was that the staff hired a lot if young adults and it made the work place very loud and uncomfortable but other than that it was alright
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,I enjoy the moment working there but management need some work. The co workers was great but upper management need some redo some of the team leader don't want to do their job.
good,Convergys is a great job. The working environment is great and the people that work there can be very nice and helpful. The most difficult thing about the job is getting comfortable on the phones. The only thing that I did not like about the job is the consistent rule changing and being misguided on information that would help you or hurt you later on. Other than that everything was great because you get the opportunity to turn someone's bad day into a great day by helping them solve their issues.
good,Ensure all the targets are meet within the given time line.. quality is the main aspect and should be on par..schedule adherence and ensure effective utilisation of time.
good,"It is been almost 4 years working with this organisation.Started when the organisation was IBM Daksh. Great standards. Excellent working  environment.Then the organisation changed to Concentrix Daksh. A lot of changes took in place. Structural change,organisational change .the best thing is job security. Timely dispersal for salary. But the only cons is that their in no appreciation for hard work.Minimal appraisal according to the market."
good,"My total experience there was it was fun working because of my colleagues, they were nice to me. Also the company has no problem when it comes to your signed salary pay off."
good,"Flexible timings and shifts. Management is pretty good. I have learned many things like how to achieve goals with team management, how to talk formally, how to walk, personality development and so on."
good,This was the hardest job I have ever had. Granted it was my first step into the call center industry and the term baptism by fire comes to mind. Back to back calls all day every day of one customer after another yelling and demeaning you because they didn't pay their bills on time. The customers concerns were often easily addressed and taken care of but it was extremely rare you received any gratitude at all. It was constant emotional battery.
good,"The hardest part working in Convergys is that they do a lot of upskilling not considering the side of their employees, a lot of work but real small increase with the compensation."
good,Nothing much to say good company to work and learn. I started my career in convergys year 2014 i worked and I enjoyed working but now i want go out from India to earn much at the same time whatever I learned from both the companies i want to implement it in the new company.
good,Concentrix Daksh is a good workplace but needed to enhance their compensation to satisfy employees needs that suited to their workload they providing.
good,They do contracts so you learn a lot because they come and go. Pay depended on the contract which made it hard for future planning. Hard to move up because the amount of staff.
good,"Smart Friend Paid Support"
good,"thank you for the experience i have fun everyday when working because of our team, i have learned to be an effective support engineer for the largest software provider in the world"
good,Try out and an be part of a great team. You will enjoy the friendly and welcoming environment who is always willing to help.
good,"With it comes to working environment, i can say convergys has it all, the reason why i resigned is because i undergone an operation. Well i wanna try home based jobs and hope to work with your company."
good,Not a day that I wanted to go to work so many benefits and feee foods but it just doesn't pays off all the stress that I had during my agent life. The place is so far so I had to give it up
good,I have worked for Convergys for nearly 6 years the best thing about this job/company is people I work with. Everyone is easy going and friendly. Good place to work at.
good,Worked as a Technical Support Engineer here. Good opportunity to learn different technologies and to get exposure to big enterprise clients. It is a bit hectic but not bad for a entry level position.
good,"Work from home can be very rewarding.  Saves on gas and work space very quiet.  "
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Its fine. I dont want to talk much about it since its part  of the contract I signed before to keep things confidential. The company is really fine but the management is not
good,I gave Convergys a try simply to be able to be able to add it as experience but would never consider reapplying.  I have nothing more to add onto this comment box.
good,The convergys itself knows how to handle and keep employees. It just happened that the people they hired to manage those accounts could be the reason why we feel we are not being valued.
good,Great opportunity to make bonuses with  sales. Very metric oriented and fast paced. The focus is on sales and meeting numbers so if you are sales oriented or not that will determine how happy you are here.
good,some of the calls can be a bit stressful if you allow them to get to you. you have to learn to no take what the customers say to you personally
good,Ambiente Lavorativo stimolante grazie al lavoro di gruppo e al team bulding
good,"I liked the work that I did at Convergys, at the call center I worked at we handled Customer service for AT&T. My co-workers were always friendly, and I enjoyed helping my customers. That being said, the center I work at has shifted its focus from customer service, to pushing sales on every call which has detrimentally impacted the experience for our customers, which is ultimately why I chose to leave."
good,"I typical day at work consist of going into work putting personal belongings away in locker, going to desk and signing into all the computer programs to assist people calling in with cell phone issues, taking calls, making sure you are not late going to to or coming back from your breaks, and signing out of all the programs when its time to go home. I learned that there are many different issues that people come up against with cell phones and not all of them are easy to fix. The hardest part of the job is finding different ways to explaining things to people that they do not understand the first time you explained it to them and new issues that you don't know how to fix without help from someone else. The most enjoyable part of the jobs is when  a customer calls in with an issues that you can fix because then the customer is happy.  Co-workers are great, fun people to be around and that want to help with anything that they can."
good,"a typical day at work means getting up early, since I'm on a dayshift. getting up early and fixed myself as I try to talk to various customers on different regions. I have learned a lot during my stay at Convergys as a Customer Service Representative. I have good interpersonal skills which allow me to easily get along with others especially the management and co-workers. The hardest part of my job is that when I talk to Irate customers, but in the end when you have tried to calm them down and provide a resolution in all their concerns, that is the most enjoyable part of your job."
good,"Concentrix is a growing corporation. They have the ability to branch out in to the international market.  their business model is beneficial to the shareholders and investors. As an employee  they did support me with growing in to management roles.  Because this corporation is so big, the losses out weight the benefits. As a result they increased their international sector and decreased the jobs available  hear in America"
good,"log into phone. assisting customers with tracking there pkgs, scheduling pickups. learned to go between screens and add proper cases for different issues"
good,"The worst management staff "
good,"No complaints, I enjoyed working there! Good staff, good people working there. Some days were long but most days flew by. I would go back and be part time if that was a possibility."
good,"Great for a first job, definitely got a lot of customer service experience under my belt. Always willing to work with your schedule. I enjoyed how they let you come to work comfortable and gave a lot of chances especially to those who didn't deserve it. The downside is that they could be very unprofessional at times and even mess up on checks. Overall, It was a good run."
good,It was an okay job for a starter. It was easy to get hours but hard for co-workers to work together as they often hired employees who seemed to not want to work there at all.
good,They were great until they started not paying me.   I didn't receive a paycheck for 6 weeks. They were not very helpful in finding out what happened to payroll.
good,"It was a pretty great place to meet new people but some of the team leaders are really rude because of my age. Anyone can tell when they're being disrespected, and the callers are usually pleasant but then you get callers that are extremely disrespectful. Other than that my co-workers made working there so much easier they were fantastic, helpful, and very friendly."
good,"Convergys is a good company to start working with, they have a great work schedule and after training if the schedule does not accommodate to your needs (daycare, school, 2nd job) they are willing to work with you and change your schedule as quickly as possible."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"A typical day at work would involve greeting all of my subordinates and colleagues and checking up on my emails and things to do for the day (which I usually have ready from the day before). I proceed with doing the tasks I am assigned to based on priority and importance and also make it a point to respond to emails. I have learned grace under pressure and appreciate opportunities for growth, technically and emotionally, and the importance of stepping up when my co-workers are unable to. The hardest part of the job would be to create action plans for performance and employee development purposes and to follow these through to ensure that you reach your expected results --- it is a difficult task given that the nature of the work is very dynamic. What I enjoy most about the job is the fact that I get to work with a wide-range of personalities that help me grow and learn."
good,"Although it can be really fun at time, it is too unprofessional for my taste. From the way the dress code is implemented to the language that is used, it feels like one is back in high school. The hardest part about working here is the fact that there are too many people that want to be leaders. When you need help people blow you off and act like you're burdensome. Everyone talks about team work but is only motivated by money and other self seeking interest. I learned thhat you have to elevate yourself. Promote yourself."
good,I made a lot of friends but i felt that we were being to pressured to simply sell and had to constantly stand up for the sales reps and their lies. I enjoyed helping people over the phone and meeting them as well. it was a decent environment and atmosphere simply because more than 60% of all people felt the same way including management. Great entry level job though for those interested in helping people.
good,Okay place to work it teaches you lot about phones and provides up to date training on products so that you are able to successfully assist and satisfy the customers.
good,Convergys has great benefits with advancements however advancements are far and few in between and usually require you to have been with the company 6 months or more and keep your performance stats high. which can be difficult to do in a high stress environment. not recommended for the easily stressed.
good,"Convergys is potentially one of the better BPOs I've worked for, but unfortunately the pay is under the poverty line.  The job is mindlessly easy, and everyone wants to help everyone, there are those though who poison the well.  Right out of college with no real bills, this job is a great stepping stone, but with kids, car payments, and a mortgage, the pay is well below acceptable."
good,"- Always busy developing my agents as well as myself, and provides lots of learning opportunities."
good,It has been a valuable experience when working with the company.Got to learn many things about work culture.The most enjoyable part of the job interacting with different people.
good,"As a Team Lead for Turbo Tax, duties include supervising a large number of agents and focusing on the success of each individual agent as well as the Team as a unit.  Using weekly one-on-one coaching with each agent, we focus on areas of opportunity to delight"
good,"I have learned to manage my time effectively and work well under pressure with minimum supervision."
good,"Essentially, Its a call center but with a bit more."
good,"We make inbound & outbound calls, we do troubleshooting for laptops, PC, tablets & phones. We do up sell Microsoft Products."
good,The management team that has been put together is the best I have ever worked for - the worst part of the job and the part that brings down the moral is the low pay
good,The environment is nice. I like the Management. They are very easy to work with as long as you are doing your job. The only thing that I don't like about the company is that there is no opportunity for a raise once you get to the highest paying department.
good,"This is a fantastic job but it is not what I was looking for, this is a job for some who enjoys to sit at a desk all day. I enjoy to move around at work and be involved in the community settings. I do enjoy it there but I hope to find something more community involved"
good,"It is one of the cmmi level5 company. I felt proud to work in it for 8months. It is my first company i learnt how to work in a team, support to the client softwares."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Call center environment and atmosphere is really good.It can be stressful at times. You do see favoritism at times but its the same in all call centers.
good,"management is half and half not too bad but some don't really know what they're doing. benefits are decent for the type of job. hardest part is giving the job your all and treating customers well with no real ""thanks"" from company like working and not getting a pat on the back"
good,"Day to day workflow is efficiently run"
good,"Convergys has good pay & benefits ! Unfortunately, their training program sucks. I would recommend for people to apply for billing & not apply for tech support."
good,My co-workers were the best part of coming to work. We always made sure to help each other when needed. This helped us all to do our job effectively.
good,"Can be stressful at times but managment does a lot of activities lime give away snacks and other prices for good performance, base pay isnt the best but the overtime you can get plus the money you can make on sells this job can get you a lot of money?"
good,"This place is awful. I understand that there are sales required, but being as pushy as they require is uncalled for. When an employee has to push until the customer yells and hangs up, then that is way too far."
good,Having a close relationship with your fellow coworkers is a definite positive for this job. The senior management does not have a strong concern or care for the agents. They seem to have a strong regard for favorites within the company. The job itself is a fun and rewarding job.
good,"Over all this is a great place to work, be flexible, and willing to grow, and think outside the box.  Balance company needs with human needs, and compromise.  Team environment, who holds each other accountable, in a way that helps each team member grow as an employee and a citizen of the plant.  Remembering to use your positive language skills and to focus on the positive.  When you see team members grow and expand on their knowledge."
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
good,I enjoyed the laid back atmosphere around the office. They also give free lunch for customer service week  and new launches.
good,"Aprendi muito sobre o idioma inglês e sobre telecomunicações."
good,this a great place to work. Very hands on and the trainers are very good at their jobs. The phone call are back to back so the day goes by faster
good,"My typical day is leading a team of 20+ technical support representatives supporting Intuit's Quickbooks.  I lead, coach, develop, monitor and evaluate agent performance.  Work with upper level operations, recruiting, training, work force management and clients to maximize throughput, reduce shrinkage, maximize efficiency of training and development and create the best possible customer experience for our clients.  Management is comprised of good leaders and management.  The culture could be better developed."
good,"I enjoyed my time with the company.  It was a great place for me to develop my skills and find out what I really enjoy doing.  They gave me lots of opportunities to shine and advance.  The company was then sold after the passing of Elaine Minacs.  I cannot say that things were the same after that, many privileges were taken away and the company was not the same."
good,"it's a big cooperate based job. not really that special. but at least I have some good experience. I've could've kept my job but because of my instructor with his lack of training, I had to take my exam that was never reviewed and ended up failing. then I was forced to give up my badge and been escorted out of the building."
good,"Fast paced job, with good benefits. Good co-workers, management is alright. Be careful of project changes it can create unstable work environment."
good,company is the best place to develop career and responsible personality. i acquired information and strategies that is applicable in every day life.management and the company  provides great assistance and support to every employees but when it comes to compensation I'm not much happy with it.
good,"I joined this company as a fresher and was initially thrilled to work there. Learnt a lot. However, there is serious concern regarding nepotistic promotions and they require you to work like a horse, sometimes 18 hours, straight."
good,"Nach vier Wochen Schulung wird Perfektion erwartet. Man telefoniert den ganzen Tag, lernt die unterschiedlichsten Kundentypen kennen. Das macht Spaß aber man muss sich an Zahlen halten, wie z.B. vorgegebene Gesprächszeit. Der Druck ist enorm. Hinzu kommt, dass man monatlich mit Schulnoten bewertet wird. Am besten ist das Gefühl, wenn man das Anliegen des Kunden klären konnte. Die Kollegen sind alle bemüht aber man hat keine Pausen zusammen, lernt sich nicht wirklich kennen. Durch den ständigen Wechsel der Kollegen ( viele gehen, andere fangen an) und auch der Teamleiter, kommt nie "" Ruhe"" in den Arbeitsalltag. Eher ist das Flair wie auf einem Hauptbahnhof."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"The one benefit of the job was my fellow co-workers.  The job does not always feel that stable, and the management does not seem to have any idea what is going on in the site.  Benefits are ok, worst after Obama Care went into affect."
good,"I worked for three different projects while I worked there, AT&T DMDR, (sales)  Chrysler Financial customer service, and AT&T warranty exchange. the co-workers, are great, I loved the diversity that they strive on. I was young, about 20, so I really didn't see the full potential I could of had at that place of employment.I did get promoted to floor support where I was no longer on the phones, but answering agents questions and answering help desk calls once a week. The benefits cost me enough, but it was really good, almost never anything out of pocket. I had a leave of absence issue that ended my employment, but at the time I had moved, and I decided to go back to school, so I moved on at the time. I would work for this place again if they would re-hire me and If I lived closer."
good,"I had been with Convergys Incorporated for 3 years and 6 months to be exact. I started as a Customer Service Representative for Amazon, the largest online retail store in the US. In less than a year, I was promoted to a Team Leader and managed 20 agents. My daily routine would involve floor walking to ensure that everyone is okay and happy to work with our customers. I also sent daily performance reports and coach. My colleagues are fun to work with and it felt like we were one big family. The company is great. They recognize exceptional talent and its management are people-oriented. Convergys is a nice place to work."
good,"great experience, time flew while working for CVG."
good,". Confer with customers by telephone or in person to provide information about "
good,"The environment was amazing. The agents were friendly and always willing to assist with whatever help needed. The managers had an open door policy and were usually pretty available for whatever issues  they were presented with. The hardest and most stressful part were the customers. As a customer service agent, Customers felt they needed to make their complaint by yelling and dehumanizing the agents. In order to keep the agents happy, most times the managers would plan family carnivals, would order food from local vendors, we would also have themed days such as superhero day. It was an attempt to keep agents from leaving a stressful environment. As a customer service agent, we were to assist customers with their complaints regarding their bills, change their cell phone plans, order their new devices and explain the difference between plans. We had to be knowledgeable of all solutions for their issues."
good,"great place, with an international and multi cultural environment."
good,Working there you never knew what you was going to get. Customers could've been good bad or ugly but it was my pleasure to help them resolve all issues with a smile.
good,"un dia normal empezaba como la mayoria se buscaba un sitio donde ubicarse y las llamadas comenzaban una detras de la otra y asi a lo largo de todo el dia todos los dias"
good,"I worked there for awhile it is an okay place to work, but you never have time for your family. They are very strict and the managers are sometimey. There is no room for advancement."
good,"Job Security is there but not very good in terms of Salary"
good,Fast paced and energetic work place that allowed to succeed and climb career ladder. Great team leaders that pushed co- workers to be successful in an everyday work enviorment
good,"convergys is a decent place to work"
good,"Fast paced, ever changing environment. Tons of on the job training and real life experience. Excellent front line training."
good,"Sitting at a desk,  helping customer get to when they need to go for the correct solution for the issues... that sounds like life handing you lemons .. really easy job."
good,"Convergys has potential to be better than what it is. Some supervisors seem to only want to help the woman, but it really what ever. The work is potato."
good,Saying convergys is stressful is an understatement if you do not have the patience to deal with monotonous calls about the same issue day in and day out every couple of minutes. A typical day consisted of being insulted by irate customers because their cable bill was too high but they were unwilling to change their packages or being yelled at that their services are not working even though they are not capable of following instructions on how to fix the issue. After hearing the same thing call after call you learn that it is not difficult to help these people as long as one is willing to ease them into co-operation by building rapport and creating genuine interest in their issues. By empathizing with people you create a short quick bond that  helps you perform your job with ease. It is because of this job that I learned that it is not what is said but how it is said that makes a difference between a good call and a bad call. This skill has helped me not only in my jobs but also my personal life. Management here is aware of the stress since they were once floor agents as well. The team leaders I had were always comprehensive and gave effective insight. The most enjoyable part of the job was after a while of working there turning a bad call into a good call became a thing of pride almost.
good,"Good benefits good people, willing to work with you on real life situations which is nice to have that type of support within a company. you don't get that a lot knowdays"
good,The job is fine it allows you to learn  or gives us chance for advancement  but since  need better job opportunities or higher salary  I quit the job
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Not enough pay for the job.  Stressful. Need to be with good computers, and  navigating many different screens. almost all calls are complaints so if you like listening to people complain and solve their problems then this is the job for u. "
good,"It was pretty hectic. I was asleep during the day and worked all night so there's not much going on with life outside of work. The management was good though, very approachable when it comes to work related problems. The company itself though, it felt like I was never treated as an asset; and I never see myself working there for the long term run. There was barely any growth career wise."
good,Good place to work for. This company has good benefits. The training hours a little crazy- 6am to start training was something!
good,I had a different experience with the company and  depending on the person the job could be a good fit or a bad one. But this one really does all come down to if you fit the title well or not.
good,"This company has great core values, however, not the right members of the leadership team to execute it.  Lacks structure and no real consistency to administering policies."
good,"The job scope changes frequently, though you don't have knowledge on those changes, you must be able to cope up or else you cannot survive the daily work."
good,"Regarding my point of view on the company , the working place is suitable to my taste because the place is nice and the people are kind , but i want to work in a place where i can use my degree that is BS in information technology."
good,I usually take calls and help the callers on the other line with their concerns and problems. There are times when callers are being rude by calling you names and cursing you with dirty words. With my experience at CVG i can say that I have learned to be patient and keen to details.
good,"well, i am on a night shift as we need to refer the time in the U.S.i don't get any problem with my co worker. however, being on a Call Center Industry is a very tough Job when you cannot see the person you are talking with into the other line. so you really need to study other persons emotion without seeing the person. Working in these Company gives me an additional experience. aside from being a Sales consultant,Service crew and a On call waiter on a 5star Hotel."
good,One thing that I will always remember about this company is the account that I am handling now.
good,Mostly phone call after phone call. There is A LOT of learning involved. They give you about 3 months after you have entered the floor to get yours stats down or you are out. Very nice cafeterias. Food/snacks a little expensive. Training provided and paid. Free Directv if you work for DTV project. The only downside is the schedule. Regular agents do NOT get a set schedule. Days off will vary every week (hardly any weekends off) unless you are a coach or a team lead you won't get set days. Huge bummer for me at least. Would only recommend to someone that does not mind the scheduling issue and having to work weekends. Very strict attendance policy.
good,"We would take in and do an outbound calls on a daily basis. During the time that we are dealing with the customer we should demonstrate good communication skills and knowledge about the product or process of the account and we should be patient all the time and learn how to place ourselves in other's shoe. Our co-workers play an important role in our career so we should establish good relationship with our co-workers because they are the ones who    would help us not only in our job but also with the other aspects of our life, if we are not in good terms w/ them then it is not going to be easy to stay and move around in our work place. The most enjoyable part of the job is we get to earn something as a result of a job well done."
good,"I have worked for this company for many years, mostly because it was hard to find a better position for equal to better pay for what we were doing. I have worked with several clients with this company. A typical day was that you arrived to work, got on the phones, and assisted the customer with what they needed done, depending on the client. The management was there to help you and coach you if needed otherwise there was not much supervision. Sadly, the coworkers were more focused on being in a clique than teaming together to help the customers. The hardest part of the job was the constant continual calls and very little praise for the job you do. The most enjoyable part was being able to help various customers from around the United States."
good,Effectively handles multiple tasks. Ability to acquire and apply knowledge rapidly. Works with minimal supervision and contributes to a team.
good,"it was a nice atmosphere for the most part"
good,"There are some truly great people working for Minacs at the Farmington Hills office. (That's the only branch I worked out of) Team Members will go out of their way to share advice and give direction to ensure your tasks are completed successfully. "
good,"On the phones eight hours a day"
good,convergys is a nice place and helpful. the people are nice and is a good place to work.
good,"Good place to start and work your way up. "
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,I usually start with logging in and talking with clients. I have learned to communicate properly with client and use tools needed for resolving the issue. Management are always supportive and gives feedback by coaching and announcements. My co workers are supportive being new to this kind of work. Help me a lot going through my daily job. Hardest part of the job is sales. The most enjoyable part is helping customers solve their issue.
good,"Convergys has allowed me to develop my skills through my work with Clients in the Call Center business. I have a very strong understanding of Workforce Management processes and the business as a whole due to my job experiences with Convergys."
good,"In my more than two years of working in IBM (later became Concentrix), I have learned a lot of things. It helped a lot in my interpersonal growth. They provided all the trainings that are necessary for my career advancement. All the managers and support staff are very friendly."
good,"My typical day at is to resolve the customer issue and make sure the customer is satisfy at the end of the call. There are times to up sale to the customer. I  enjoy my team because its about teamwork, we work together and assist each other when necessary. I really enjoy working with people."
good,"I was a part of the pilot batch for Capital One. Inc Customer Service when they partnered with Aditya Birla Minacs."
good,Working at Convergys I've learned a lot more about phones. I've also enjoyed answering calls and solving customers problems.
good,"good place to work"
good,"In my position you would go into work and work with the agents on making sure that agents are provided excellent customer service and making an offers on every call."
good,Worked through temp services great environment was treated like regular staff. Enjoyed the Kelly Service team they were great.
good,Pay is not that great but the work environment is fun and easy going.  Great stepping stone to get to where you really want to be.
good,"Working at Minacs wasn't the worst experience. It more or less was one of the the nicer call centres you can work at, but the job is always the same. Talking on the phone can be extremely draining, but if you have the drive to do so for 8 hours non stop, then this job is definitely for you. If not, then you might want to look somewhere else. All in all, not a terrible place to work, but definitely not for me as I've worked in many call centres. I'm just over it for a lack of better words."
good,A day at Convergys consist of sitting at a computer and answering calls from some happy but mostly furious customers. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who are anger about their services being provided or their cell phones. The things I learned from Convergys was how to deal with people who are mad in a good calm way to where there anger doesn't affect your mood. I also leaned a lot of computer and phone skills.
good,A typical day consisted of answering about 30 calls per day for inbound customer support. Here I greatly improved my time management skills and interpersonal skills. The management we always easily approachable and there to help you. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers and the weird shifts that I had to work. The most enjoyable part was knowing that I had health benefits and a constant pay check. Also the thrill of fixing someones problem is always a good feeling
good,"Customer service "
good,"This job was very hectic . back to back phone calls , the job was great itself ut the enviorment was not wat im typically used to so. I did learn alot og management skills and tyhe great customer service skills."
good,"i would personally say i myself am a decent agent,i was able to sell directv products and programming everyday. The management was poor,the scheduling was never right. It was an alright place."
good,I enjoyed the training classes. I was not a fan of having to upsell the cable services.
good,"I don't think this company really has enough knowledge of their clients or clients' needs.  They use the ol' ""bait and switch"" to get you through their doors, offering one position then claiming the positions are for a different job with a different client.  And the client rules and regulations are different from what Convergys tells you to expect.  Otherwise, the process was fairly smooth and the people were extremely nice as well as co-workers. Everyone smiles, even in the early hours."
good,"Being with a call center that handled outsourced accounts meant dealing with customers that were not local while providing assurance that you were ""there"" to help regardless of the distance. You learned troubleshooting skills for our customers network and offered promotions/opportunities to build customer loyalty."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,The is a great place to work. It will allow you to work side by side with doctors to help fulfill the patients needs.
good,loved coworkers. managers and staff fluxed and changed a lot. high turnover. lots of office activities and free stuff. rewarded for working hard and helping customers.
good,A typical day will be sitting in your cubical and waiting for calls to come in
good,"As soon as you would to walk into Convergys you would have to be ready for the intense of calls received. Its a inbound only call center and the calls where from all parts of the United States. Interacting with these customers would be for the product they were using. The company I was working for was Charter Communications (cable company) we would answers the customers questions and concerns. Sales was part of the metric as well so any movie, sport, etc. we would have to up sale to get commission. The hardest part of the job was telling the customer that there was nothing you can do for them if there was no option to take. I enjoyed talking to different kinds of people all over America and on air time listening to my customers and their adventures."
good,"You have about 10 weeks of training, with this in my experience I had over 5 different trainers just within 4 weeks. After 4 weeks of training in a classroom where i did not learn much we are put on the floor to start taking calls. The center was a bit crowded and loud at times. The hardest thing about working here was how long it would take a coach to come help someone who is still in training with questions they have. However what i found most enjoyable was helping consumers with any problems they are having with their phones/ service."
good,"Answer calls from USPS customers regarding services, zip codes, and mail routes."
good,"The location was not ideal when i was a student with no vehicle, the bus route does not run during about 20-25% of your scheduled time."
good,"Convergys is a great company if you have little experience but a great attitude, work ethic and drive to succeed.  They give you opportunities to grow within the organization and you can become successful if you work at it.  You must however be disciplined enough to have a good work/life balance and be in the very top percent to get a raise."
good,"-Answering calls, attending to customers needs, pitching sales and troubleshooting."
good,Nice work culture. Excellent benefits. opportunities for advancement available.
good,"JOB SECURITY?ADVANCEMENT should not be in the same judging category for this employer. the job advancement is very high especially if you want the position you are reaching for. truly is a great place for job advancement. however, job security depends on the customer and how they view the company you end up representing. which is not fair because it does not truly matter to convergys what you as a representative of that company gets scored at. honestly, only take the job if there is nothing else. they pay a decent wage but are truly a middleman / temporary agency in every aspect. the position(s) should pay more / hr so that the turnover rate wouldn't be so high. and needs alot of work on who they hire as it seemed very unprofessional at times due to a lack of mature employees to say the least."
good,"A typical day would be coming into work, finding a computer, and logging in, then getting on the phone. I learned that my ability was limited and instead of trying to resolve issues personally, all I could do was document a case. Once I started getting straight to the point, my call handle times went down significantly. I was taught how to navigate through systems and research answers to questions, how to defuse an angry conversation, as well as helpful scripting. "
good,The hardest thing about working for Convergys is trying to troubleshoot hard wire to senior citizen customers they really dont understand
good,"Happy with the company, stressed out with the account. I learned a lot though."
good,At Convergys is a nice place to work i gave it a 3 stars because of things i have seen that i didn't like. As far has getting close to finishing your class some of the teachers can be very rude. I called management and tried to tell them what happened and they didn't didn't do nothing.
good,"this was a great company to work for.  it had great pay and benefits.  the only down fall is they only do a lot of hiring during enrollment period and when that is over lay off almost all employees hired.  i wish this would have been a permanent position, but overall was a great company"
good,"Overall was very fun since I was in ""party life mode"", not for anyone sitting in a chair taking calls tends to be unhealthy."
good,"My typical day consisted in doing payroll reconciliation for my team and sometimes for other Team Leaders, talk to my employees, do some coaching on their calls, assist to important staff meeting and do team meetings for the agents so they can be up to date on the business.  It consisted too of doing a lot of HR with the agents. The hardest part of the job is being loved by everyone and please everyone, it’s not always possible. The greatest part is coaching agents on a flaw that they have on the phone and seeing result."
good,"At the moment a day at work includes getting up at 10am and working non-stop on the phones until 8pm. My shift hours just changed so this is not something I am used to."
good,Its a good experience and enjoyed my work and specaly thank the DAT Team
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes!

good,had to report to work early just to get computer up and running so that i could begin taking calls as soon as 8am began. learned how to multitask on a computer. there was a wide variety of cultures that i worked with. the hardest part of this job was sitting at the computer for such a long period of time. the most enjoyable part of the job was the training.

good,"Training associates was fun and fulfilling.  The challenges this position offered really helped improve my skill set."
good,"A typical day at Convergys entailed assuring that all customer's needs were met, within reason.  I learned to work with different types of personalities and did a great job at it.  My co-workers and I always work together in one's absence.  I enjoyed helping others."
good,"The training process was very effective and I felt well prepared when I was moved trainee to the floor. The incentives were amazing and a great way to motivate employees to work harder. Management didn't seem to care about employees, just their own well being. The company didn't work with employees with medical issues or paperwork, requested time off for important reasons, or termination process."
good,"trouble shooting for at&t wireless devise, so that customer would feel satisfied. "
good,Low pay and requires patience... a lot of patience. Aside from that its a fun environment and you receive paid training

good,assisting with the customers basic directv problems
good,"answer incoming calls, suggest and create sales, provide customer service, friendly coworkers, easy going management"
good,You're treated like a child rather than an adult. So I chose to leave on my own accord.
good,Convergys was fun and management was the biggest issue. Things were always changing and never new if you were going to get written up for new things that were never explained.
good,"Everyday was pretty much the same, take calls about newspapers. No changes in the day."
good,"The job is okay, Management is rude. They have two managers that are 100% nice all the time. I enjoy working here just not getting put down or getting told to do two differnet things."
good,"It was fun and warm work environment, had fun with the team during the week off, office time was as usual, fun at the beginning and later became the same monotonous work."
good,"Clock in, answer phones, sell products, offer upsales, make customer comfortable, handel upset customers professionally. Very flexable schedules"

good,The job is really simple once you get a basic knowledge of the services you provide. They scheduling moves around a lot and you don't get raises. On the plus side if you keep your stats high enough you can qualify for different bonuses.
good,"Convergys is a great company to work for. However, there are some things that could be improved about the company. A typical day at work is giving customers routes to where they need to be and I enjoy helping the customers. The management at Convergys could be improved a little bit and the building could be cleaned better than it is. At the end of the day I enjoy doing my job and I am happy that I do have a job."
good,It was a standard call center nothing really to say. You came in and sat down exactly when you were supposed to start work and you took took calls from typically angry customers who were tired of trying to get their phone fixed.
good,"It was always loud while at work, with many young people working there.. it was definitely a learning lesson on patience, self-control, and time management."
good,I have learned how to make my compliance calls in the beginning of the day and still be able to get to my committed calls to my customers and dealerships by the time I leave at the end of the day.
good,"Working for Concentrix was a very high maintenance posisition. There are daily, weekly and monthly targets."
good,Anwser inbound calls daily. I learned more customer service skills and also the proper procedures to de-escalate a call and deal with customers to there specific needs. I enjoyed the most letting the customer knnow and feel how important they were to the company.
good,"I have learned about troubleshooting internet systems and many types of computer equipment. A typical day involves dealing with computer savy as well as computer challenged individuals,assisting the with issues they may have related to their current services. The hardest part of the job is making sure you understand the issue in order to better serve the customer. Co-workers are excellent and awesome to work with. The environment is very family oriented. Managers are helpful, but need improvement on availability. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with a diverse group of people."
good,Talk to different people all day on the phones. learned about credit and credit cards. Management is okay. co-workers will help you if you need. The hardest part of the job is that you can't make everyone happy. I enjoyed learning new things and helping people.
good,fast paced.
good,"A typical day at work was always intresting, handling accounts for DTV customers, and being an advocate for my agents"
good,"I worked there in 2001 and was started at 11.00 dollars and hour which was decent pay at that time. I worked at the site in Dartmouth, and there weren't enough seats at shift change, so you would have to slip seat, and then deal with someone's attitude when they returned from the bathroom or break. The management was not good or helpful. But the job was easy and pay was good enough. Okay for an in-between job."
good,"company is very versatile, fun to work with co-workers, lot of growth and good benefits, work under a lot of pressure, customer was satisfied at the end of my call"
good,"Answering phone calls. Listening to the same issues everyday. I learned how to value the job and people around you. I have some issues with the management. They're fun to be with. I really love being with them. They always makes me happy. We're helping out. Hardest part is when they introduced sales to our account. It's really hard at first but when you get used to it, it's really fun helping customers save their money and also help the company earn more customers. Having a team getaway."

good,"my typical day is usually 7-4, customer usually call about mail or retail benefit, since i been working here my phone skills with members has heighten.

The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people with their prescriptions."
good,"customer service was great attentive to needs of their clients, was first call resolution..Great company to work for"
good,"If you have patients the work is actually acceptable. However if the Supervisors, Operations Manager, Or site Manager don't like you, your days are numbered. Regardless if other employee’s are doing the same things you are doing. They will single you out and find ways to attempt to terminate you. Speaking of the supervisors, they don't want to take any escalated calls, and for good reason they have to much work on their plate, so I don't blame them. That's the only problems with this company."
good,Best place for work with job security but as per salary part not good
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes!

good,You answer phone calls about different clients and call and ask them for surveys. Its a good part time job but get tiring when most respondents wont stay on the phone with you. So its just listening to a dial tone hoping someone will want to talk to you.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the rapport I'm able to have with my direct report. We were all able to come together as one team and stay consistence with all requirements. Being able to coach each individual and for everyone being able to accept what needs to be fixed. With everyone having the same drive and vision toward the goal that needed to be reached such as Issue Resolution we were able to reach and excced that goal.
good,"Convergys is a fortune 500 company that gives employees the opportunity to work with several different companies through contracts. There are several different projects within the company.

good,"Call Center, centered on talking with customer regarding their credit card accts"
good,"I loved all the team leads there, had a great expierence working with everyone and loved the job"
good,"For the type of company (largely an outsourced call center for the state), it is very nice and the hours were great. However, it seemed to be more of a stepping stone company. Where one would work to gain experience and move on to state or HR professional position."
good,"The job security and level of advancement was good. This is a huge multitasking job. While having live customers on the line you are simultaneously running numerous programs on a computer. The company requires several verbatim statements which you must say. And also have a quota to make a sell, somewhere in a technical service call."
good,"The managers are inviting and friendly, contracts can get difficult and sometimes there are technical issues you can do nothing about. not for weak of heart."
good,"You have to be aware about all the possible options that you can grab within the company and make sure you grow. Everything depends on your own capability, so make sure you grab whatever this company has to offer to you."
good,A lot of great people working for a company that doesn't protect their employees. They tend to fire long term employees to promote young people who will work for less.
good,"Concentrix bought out our company Convergys then closed us down within a few months"
good,"pros:"
good,its a place where dress code is not required.salary is on time and your culture is respected.pressure from work is real.attendance is a basic requirement.healthcare ltovider is better.
good,"Except salary everything is fine.."
good,"Very strict guidelines without any assurance of a position after seasonal work.  Too many breaks in pay.  Good opportunity to obtain license, but uncertain at best"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Great job for advancement. It doesn't have the best culture or compensation, but it provides a great opportunity to learn how most workplace cultures are constructed."
good,Good choice for entry level call center employment.  Extensive training.  Medium paced environment with generally happy customers.  Straight forward repetitive tasks.  Reasonable metrics and targets.
good,"It is what it is, not a groundbreaking place to work. Management was typically nice and accommodating, but the work itself isn't fantastic and the 8 1/2 hr days staring at a computer can be rough for your health."
good,"Well with it changing companies to something different. Its a major change an not the best job to work at. Its stressful, your job is determine off of if people want to spend their money or not. Metrics have to be met off certain standards which is hard to do. They don't give you kudos for the good things you do, they focus more on the negatives. I learned to pretty much do your job and go home. Sometimes the job has it to where you can't even stay all day because its not a happy job, a person should want to be comfortable at their job, this is not it. If you enjoy talking to people then the job is fine, but if you not reaching the standards and you know you are trying your hardest .. they don't see it, they'll find something wrong constantly and that's not right."
good,"This job required me to Resolves problems by clarifying issues; researching and exploring answers and alternative solutions; implementing solutions; escalating unresolved problems,Answering inquiries by clarifying desired information; researching, locating, and providing information.Receiving inbound calls including transferred sales leads and calls from current and potential customers. Meet Quality Assurance Requirements and other key performance metrics"
good,I love going to my job. The managers are willing to work with you.  The hours could be flexible.  The job is in a good area. The parking is good. The job is easy and nice co-workers.
good,"Pros"
good,Overall Concentrix was a great company to work for but they definitely need to improve with whom they put for management and care more about their employees.
good,"Training is great and salary compensation is good, however company should also focus on agents who are having hard times at work. e.g making agents feel they are valued by the company"
good,"Easy to get into, with paid training in my experience, with great job culture, although in my case no cell phones during chat advisory or phone support."
good,"Making expectation on meeting goals, and going the extra mile for there customers.  Great training program, even have the option to apply for extra class time for certifications related to the field."
good,"I think if a person cleared 12th pass with any stream and do not have any plan for further they can join this company, it is BPO sector so kindly enter this company who has more interest in BPO sector."
good,"One of the reasons I left was because I couldn't handle the 10+ hour back-to-back shifts. For example, I could be scheduled from 9:30 am to 7:30 pm which is 10 hours, however you actually have to arrive 10 minutes prior to your shift in order to load all the programs and be ready to take a call exactly when your scheduled shift starts."
good,Even though your tired they have comfortable place to stay with. You can either watch movies or shows at their lobby or stay at the sleeping quarters.
good,"Up beat company , very fast pace job. Different cultures your learning everyday. Had fun. Customers where very challenging when it came to Sirius dm because very everyone loves their music so much !!!"
good,Convergys was a great place but just couldnt work with the family issues but overall great experience and wouldnt mind going back if my situation changes at home.
good,"Convergys was a good company to work for. It had room to grow and wanted to help you grow from within, I just didn't like the hours. They also didn't seem to have room for me to change my time."
good,I enjoy working in convergys and it is a good work place for someone currently needing employment but I would not class the job as a permamnent career unless you are looking to move up through the company.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"On Convergys the management was very considerate of the new graduates and applicants with no BPO experience. This is where my career has started, learned the remote access troubleshooting stuff and all."
good,I started out in an entry level position in this company doing customer service on the phone. With my 4 years of employment I was able to work hard and be promoted several times. A great place to build you resume but pay is well below average for most salary positions. There are a few people in management and HR positions that have no business being there.
good,Convergys is a great place to work especially if you are learning to work from home. Mangers are auwsome. Schedules are felixable and you have to be avaiable to work when ever
good,Convergys is an inbound call center. I used to assist customers with technical support for AT&T as well as assist with making payments. The most enjoyable part of working at convergys was working the my team. I had an excellent coach and great team players.
good,"very relaxed and slow paced work environment, a good place to work with good pay and opportunities to advance within the company, guaranteed hours and different work experiences more like a temporary job"
good,I think for me at this job the cons out weighted the pros. When I first started they said it wasn’t a job for everyone. I sit for long periods of times and their policies with the company for customers don’t make me feel comfortable explaining to the customer. It’s an easy job but they do push things on you without coaching you how to excel. I know people who worked there 8+ years and some barely month. It really depends on your life style.
good,"I enjoyed my time at this company and felt like it  was a good paying job and always got all the hours that i needed,but felt like the management could have been better at times."
good,"Typical day at work would consist of 10-hour shifts, two 15-min breaks and a 1-hour lunch. "
good,awesome nice cool environment to work at. i like the area its close to my house. people are friendly and the supervisor are alwayts enthusiastic to help whenever you have questions.
good,You have the times when the job is fun but most of the time you are cold calling and getting abuse from people so this can be a down side to the job. .
good,"ok but not for a perminant job, fun people but the job isnt the nicest, very stressful and mostly out of the employees hands. breaks are good time wise"
good,"very friendly and welcoming staff, not sufficient enough training, need a better system for helping advisors with things they don't know. Great place to start out at but I wouldn't make a career out of it."
good,"I am currently at Team lead. I have 24 agent on my team. On a daily basis I work within my team to help agents hit goals based on our project. This includes but not limited to coaching , side by side, creating job aids for that individual"
good,medical claims processing. no work from home options with this title. different contracts with concentrix so more than medical claims processing jobs available. would like more money for the work
good,"The job environment was fast paced due to customers calling in for assistance with billing, technical issues, ect. It's easy to learn the ropes with selling and building a connections with customers. The pay was decent but the hour choices are hard for students. I had a good experience just my only problem was the flexibility."
good,"HUMANA Project...I felt like I was in high school all over again, its a lot of drama and the managers are wishy-washy my manager was cool but the other ones weren't. All anyone cared about was meeting your 16 quotas a day and they openly announced who was doing a good job and who wasn't."
good,Everyone  is good. less people in the program. less work pressure. The boss are good they are considerate and fun. There's always comission once you meet the target.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"I enjoyed the call center environment at that timeof my life when i was younger. i understood my job very well, and was very dependable. however, after working there for 3 years, i never recieved any raises from when i started, and decided to move on. its a good companyin the sense that its easy to get hired on."
good,"You are mainly sitting down and looking at the computer screens waiting on calls. I learned a lot about the software programs, but more trainings are needed in my opinion in order to fully understand them. Calls range from great, okay, to horrible depending on the customer and the problem they have. The people there to work with are amazing including the staff and supervisors. The people are what made working there bearable. Overall, it's a great company, but it also depends on which department you fall under."
good,"In the Logan Branch where I worked, you took calls for customers having problems with their Comcast services. The job itself is not enjoyable, however the base pay is 10.25 an hour, and you do get extra money for any sales you make, however I did have a mandatory sales rate of 4%, or about a sale a day."
good,Convergys was a great place to work. Fast paced because of the amount of inbound phone calls that were received. The hours was great and they gave plenty of paid time off. But I never used really unless I was sick and thats rare. Management was good and offered ways to train their employees.
good,"Mainly focuses on team performance and how to drive it to reach individual and team goals. I had the chance to learn people management through effective coaching. Support agent friendly environment. When it comes to challenges, retention would be the hardest though there's a chance to guide people into the right path that they should take depending on their personality, mindset and responses."
good,"People are nice specially Team Leaders and Supports, the hardest part of the job is making a sale for the team, the most enjoyable part of the job when there is a get away with the team/teams."
good,*Difficult work environment*how to interlink different software platforms*managers were fine*too-high expectations*meeting metrics*my fellow employees
good,"Veel telefonische gesprekken( engels)"
good,Convergys is very similar to a highschool. It is a lot of drama but a good place to work at over all besides that. Communication isn’t that good either. The pay is great & getting my work done is a breeze.
good,"I have been working here since january 2017, Good work culture and staff is good. But the hike in salary is too much low. And promotion is after working for one year."
good,I had 5 good years there. Had a few more left in me. Constant interaction with people. Mixed culture. Diverse. Good atmosphere for the most part. Constant target driven.
good,"call center work"
good,I able to learned the things things that i didnt learn before and now thanking all the opportunities that ive been cuz its changed me a lot being able to succeed.
good,"They always come up with ways on how to engage all employess and have each and everyone have some fun and relieve some stress. Cool perks, benefits, awesome colleagues."
good,"With the exception of low salaries and expensive dinners, everything is very positive. The work is difficult but iterative. Very friendly atmosphere. Good organization of work. Various projects.Good technical support."
good,"It was a international voice prices which I was working. It had a long lasting friendly environment, supportive collouges. Every week the fun activities was held to refresh our mind."
good,"I enjoyed working  there,  I wish I was still there but I have too much going on at home.  But other then that it was a good job,  good experience... And I did enjoy it when I was there."
good,"The job is fine, the workload is fine. Hours of operation for the project I am on are not flexible. I enjoy the Managers quite a lot, but the pay is low and the benefits are quite expensive. My career is not likely to advance at this company for permanent work."
good,Convergys is a good place to work at. They give you the training you need in order to be productive with your customers/clients. Management pushed employees in making sure that customers issues are taken care of and that there needs are met.
good,Took it for what it was a stepping block was what it really was for me. I got my first car and apt there so I appreciated it all the help. Would recommend to people
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Great learning experience. CVG has a nice working environment. Although the compensation isn't that competitive and the workload is getting more. Nevertheless, the management is very open to employees concern."
good,"You checks will not be right from time to time management checks have been wrong for months. some not paid correctly for months.  the office will make you feel like your the walking dead."
good,"Poor management's and the sallary is not that good, some medical benefits are not aplicable like tooth extraction, mandates overtime frequently, some benifits are not applied."
good,"Educated the customers about the brand to incite excitement about the company's mission and values. Addressed and resolved customer product complaints empathetically and professionally. Referred unresolved customer grievances to designated departments for further investigation. "
good,Overall you can work here for good 2 years to build your career. Its a good plave for people looking for growth and stability. Not the best in terms of money.
good,"I called people about their satisfaction with a particular company and the product that they bought. I learned about those experiences. Overall, it was not fun sometimes getting yelled at, just because I was reading a script."
good,They always try and make sure they have extra incentives to make the job worth coming too. When it comes to Advancing in the company or raises its not really good
good,"Not bad if you have the stamina and attention for full-time call centre work. Some may find it gruelling or boring, but the floor has an excellent atmosphere of camaraderie and you work as a team to make the best of the task at hand."
good,"This company is a good one to work for if you are only responsible for yourself. If you are the care taker for another they are not very flexible with whatever nay come with that. Also, if you are in school it could potentially be hard to balance the two"
good,"The only real problem i had here is when i went to a promotion and my daughter got sick, they didn't want to work with me to train on a different day. I had called plenty of times, and no answer from my manager at that time, I feel that was very rude. I had good QA scores, and worked hard everyday!"
good,Best thing about the organization is the training. The trainers were very professional. Was also given the role of a trainer for new joinees for Microsoft Outlook and Outlook express.
good,"Organisation needs to be more employee friendly. Grooming and career pathing of existing employees not done as per expectations."
good,"Great place to make cash for minimum physical activity. Everyday 9-5 kind of job. Management is great, they are employees that have been promoted and are understanding and very willing to help you move up."
good,Work was easier once I had an understanding of the systems. Customers were rarely an issue and employees are great. The management is good to.The hardest part of the job will be people who don't understand how the systems work. The most enjoyable part of the job was the environment of the job was understanding for the most part.
good,"This job is really fast paced. You have to think fast and move fast with no breaks. The headphones were not very good, so you had to struggle to make out what the customer said. Learned to sound things out and find out through experience what customer wanted."
good,"I have been having a problem with another person who works at Concentrix and instead of making sure that each of their employees feels safe, they would rather hire just anyone off the streets."
good,If you like being yelled at about things that are out of your control this is the perfect job for you!  We handled the escalated calls meaning that the person who handled the call before us messed up the customers account and we had to smooth everything over will a small amount of options very quickly.
good,Being at Convergys for the time I was there was good because I gained knowledge working in the civilian work force once I got out of the Marine corps. Advancement was also great because I was able to move from one position to another one quickly utilizing my skill sets and advancing them in technology assistance.
good,"answer incoming calls, update customer records, offer additional services. Coworkers were friendly and i enjoyed helping the customers with their questions or issues."
good,"Great job, decent pay, awesome for gaining experience would recommend to anyone with a willingness to learn. Co-workers are pretty cool diverse work environment. Not the job to be at if you're looking to grow career wise. Vision and dental benefits are a lot better this most company's insurance is a tad bit expensive great benefits package. Career fairs, great management, continuous learning, Decent schedule depends on stats. Work environment can be stressful and very unorganized a majority of the time. New attendance policy sucks and needs to be removed."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Hiring was a breeze. I was subcontracted. Pay was low but was convenient working ftom home. Management was impossible to contact only great during training simply because you spoke to supervisor daily.
good,"Fun workplace but it is too stressful process. Management is good, but sometimes incentive pay is being delayed and being more complicated. Over all, I recommend this workplace."
good,The position gives job security as long as your customer retention score is maintained. Being a phone rep. requires a lot of patience since it is one call after the other. Met different people and made great friends.
good,"The typical day at work really depends on which day of the week you are working.  Weekends are typically very busy.  However, most of the week, you are dealing with a moderately paced environment during the mornings then it increases in pace as you go through the day.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with irate customers that will not accept a hard message regarding what they want to accomplish.  The most enjoyable part of the job is talking to people throughout the country and the world."
good,Overall a good organisation. Wanted to work with such a brand name. Norms of the company is good and as well as the work environment. Concentric is firmed about the rules and regulations. And they do follow their 9 cultural statements.
good,I made a lot of great friends while working here.  I learned a lot and there were always lots of prizes to win.  The pay was not great and I did not like the hours.
good,"Its also easy to  lose your job there, because  uou have too many bosses there, and also for someone who might stay  sick a lots that place could be that worst enemy.  But other than that it's ok."
good,The job requires much accuracy and detail to important information and because the health and insurance industry is always changing it effect the way claims are processed; so processors have to be able to learn and retain information at any moment. Processor must also process so many claims per hour and you are not given raises. yes there are chance to earn bonuses but you must earned them and 1 error out of 30 days can keep you from earning it
good,It's OK for the young generation just starting out!  Just not a job for me but it is easygoing and very easy to learn and make the numbers that are asked of you.
good,"I loved working at convergys, it was a great environment. The only issue that I ever had was management. They never worked with you, it made it seem like they would want you to quit on your own."
good,Concentrix is a really good organization.Good atmosphere.Cooperative Managers. Salary is always on time. I will never forgot these day that i have spent with Concentrix.
good,people who work here are really friendly. I've gain a lot friends and management are helpful too. Trainers and Team Leaders are great too. Depending on a project some us a lot of OT and bunoses.
good,"we get enough time to learn and earn for a particular product however the tough task is to change the department."
good,My over review  of the company concentrix  would be . It was a great starting point for learning a new trade. I don't agree with the salary for the amount of work the front line agents do. But my overall  review of this company would be a 6  out of 10.
good,"When i first joined Convergy India, I was not sure if i could fit in with the crowd... But as i worked there for a week or so, I found out that most of the people working there are youngsters just like me and very polite... You could not speak in any language other than in english when you're in the building."
good,Working with Convergys is the excellent part of my career in a BPO industry. I got a chance to work with Multi-Cultural client and the best part of my job as a Subject Matter Expert is to deal with people in my team that I need to inspire each and everyday. However there maybe ups and downs but I managed to pull it off because by the end of the day it is still my team and it is my job to lift them up to their full potential as they can be.
good,Convergys gave me my first experience in the call center world and it was quite the experience. Started on the AT&T Wireless account which was sold then became a different name so we had to be retrained on how the new company wanted their customer service reps to handle their calls.
good,"Concentrix is great workplace for new comers to the BPO industry. A lot to learn and management emphasizes on personal growth of the individual."
good,"I have to set up the tools of the Account and prepare myself. "
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"its a nice environment and everyone is friendly, if you like call centre work then its perfect and people are always there to help you"
good,Convergys is indeed a well respected company. They are very particular with the Integrity of the Company as well as the integrity of all the employees.
good,Good team environment. If you like learning this would be a great opportunity.  The atmosphere is very fast paced. Over-time offered on when working on special projects.  The company offered lots of diversity.
good,"typical day at work: receiving phone calls, pitching sales, troubleshooting, answering inquiries about the billing statements"
good,Everyday is a normal day. All co-employee are easy to get along especially with the TM's.You will not fell bored in the company since that there's a karaoke room in the pantry area to relax yourself.
good,"It is generally a pleasant place to work with. Friendly and warm workplace culture but I cant help but feel a certain discrimination when it comes to age. Integrity and professionalism is very visible.Management is sometimes insensitive. Hardest part of the job is you are required to do overtime and cover job that are not on your job description. Enjoyable part is Australian account is much easier to handle, dayshift and people are very friendly."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people on the phones everyday. Management was great, the hardest part of my job was really figuring out what was wrong with the product that was messing up and whether or not i needed to get the customer up to my supervisor."
good,"Convergys is a good place to grow your career. The company has a good talent development system in place. Developing yourself and your people is the focus of the company. What's great about the company is that you can re-invent yourself. You don't have to be stuck in the same position. The company encourages employees to learn new skills, explore other departments withing the company and experience new things. The company also focuses on achieving extraordinary results.  Most employees would say that working for Converys is stressful but it is an environment that drives growth."
good,Good Place To Gain The Right Experience Needed For Future Job ..Have Many Level Departments And Works With Students Who Are In School
good,"Lo que me gusta de la empresa es su intento de hacer de los días de los empleados un poco menos monótonos."
good,Working for Convergys was great. Its was a warm enviting and friendly working environment. The supervisors were very helpful and professional. The customers helped you get through a days work never a dull moment.
good,"Work from home positions earn less money but are a viable option when commuting is an issue. Pay is decent, but as an essential third party vendor you are better getting hired directly from the company you will be affiliated with for customer support. Benefits packages and health insurance are high and offer little coverage"
good,"Relaxed environment although extremely busy. Mass overtime! That was important to me. Most days if there was ever a need to work overtime, management would put a call out and if you were able they would appreciate it and you were definitely compensated for it."
good,Day consist of mostly answering phones and assisting customers while making sure that metrics are meeting goal. I've learned leadership skills and the management is consistent on answering any questions about process compliance. The Environment here is casual and the people can be a little eccentric at times. The hardest part of the job will probably have to be managing workload while meeting metric goals depending on what department you are in. The most enjoyable part of the job will have to be the feeling you get when being able to successfully solve a customers issue and they escalate to your supervisor to give you a compliment.
good,It's really not a bad place to work. The trainers explain the job well and the fellow employees are very helpful. Would recommend to a person who is looking to start in customer service.
good,"Great place to work, very flexible and wiling to work with employees to ensure workplace comfort. Only complaint is under compensation for workload and responsibility."
good,"I found the hardest part of this job was the stressful nature of the phone calls. Although there is a lot of help around if needed, work peers were always able to help give a hand and information."
good,"Typical day at work is almost the same the only difference is the customer who comes in. Day depends on how we interact with them, what type of customer and how you build connection with them. About management and co workers we can't choose who we work with it's about how we cope with their personalities. i can work to anyone. hardest part of the job is that if we dont want what we are doing. because if you don't wan't what your doing lazy, not productive etc follows"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,To start off they put you on a point system and that can be a pain...its easy to get in trouble with the point system. You're on the phone all day of course it's a call center.
good,"It is a really good job, you not only have everything thought to you and help if needed, but it is a place where you get to meet new people and share good moments. When it comes to some of the management, some of them they prefer to have some favorites in the people that work there and treat them well, while they treat others differently."
good,"Enthusiasm in working, growth, active environment. working with Minacs was an great experience. learned many things. The shift timings are very convenient. The Co-workers are co-operative. Fun workplace."
good,"The people I met through this job are people I'm still friends with today. I was able to move up at a good pace here but the morale was not always great on the call floor. The strategies used to boost morale actually had the opposite effect. They did accommodate for school for a good time then they didn't all of a sudden. Overall, I really loved the memories I had there but due to the direction in which management was heading I would not work there again."
good,"Answering customer service calls for this company is always opportunity for sales. We we're required to sell on every call, or at least attempt to sell. The managers we're were not very available, or accessible at times. My manager made little effort to help me secure vacation time that I earned to go see my grandma for her 100th birthday (wasn't even a holiday). "
good,Learn to be more patient with people every day at the end of the day it was fun to have the satisfaction the members are happy with the company and me . and always know the I had great co-workers
good,Convergys has equipped me with everything I needed to be efficient and effective as an Operations Manager and a Mentor in this industry. I believe being a proper Leader though is in you and I have developed and earned that with the guidance and example that I've seen from excellent people who have also worked their way up in the call center business. Nothing is more gratifying and fulfilling than to see your people grow and be promoted under your management and that is one of the motivating factors that kept me in this company. It has been my second family for the past decade and I have respect for the people who have brought me to where I am today and molded me into the kind of leader that people looked up to and respected.
good,"I worked as a Pharmacy Technician with this company and my experience with some of the agents was not so pleasant. It was like I was entering back into high school all over again, The mentality of some of the agents there are very immature. I have addressed these situations to Team Leads, but the problems still persisted. It is so sad what the Team Leaders have to deal with sometimes there when it comes to unruly agents. Most of my team leads were nice, except for one Team Leader who was not at all understanding and did not have the soft skills to be a Team Leader. I did try my best to be the better person, but there were times when I just wanted to change over to a new supervisor, but I stuck it out silently until I was switched to the nicest Team Leader ever. The culture here is like a three ring circus, there is no structure here The training for the Pharmacy Tech class is ONE WEEK, and they expect you to know all of the SOP's and the Job Aids right away, or else you get docked on your quality scores. Not the Trainer or Team Leaders fault, it is the Company who is contacted with Convergys fault, they are the ones who are pressuring them to pressure the agents to meet all of these goals in such a short amount of time. After the second week on the job you are put on the phones.  You have Assistant Coaches to the Team Leaders and Trainers, who are there to answer all of your questions, when you are stuck on a call, and you do not know how to assist the patient. Also you have the Trainer who is also there to assist you with your questions. After a few days of taking calls inside"
good,My most enjoyable part of my job is knowing I was able to help a customer and follow through  with their needs.  The other enjoyable part of my  day is seeing my co-workers and coming up with great ideas.
good,My opinion is for the role that i am currently on. It has the right balance between work and life since i am still able to enjoy and have time for my personal life outside of work.
good,"~ To persevere consistently, so as to ensure the growth of the self and the organization"
good,"great team to work with lot of experienced management and colleagues."
good,Its a wonderful starting place to begin a career they have a lot of options and benefit packages. Pretty decent advancement options
good,"Managers should crowdsource reviews about an employee's work from their entire staff, so they can get a complete and accurate picture of an employee's performance throughout the entire year. It provides constant feedback to both individuals and their managers, while informing the community at large of progress. It harnesses the wisdom of the crowds to give accurate and specific feedback on individual performance, and it will harness the power of data analysis to connect performance to profits. More than anything, it continuously drives company behavior toward a deliberate, strategic culture"
good,"good working environment,flexible shift timings and supportive staff."
good,Great place to work. Fun people. Everyone is so positive and energetic. Meet many new people and very helpful people. Everyone was so helpful when it came to having issues on the job.
good,"When I went to work I opened tools to use in handling and communicating the customers, I did learn fast typing and also how to communicate with the customers using English, the management is good and they also gave the right benefit that the employee needs."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"My job consisted of answering incoming calls, My day started by logging into the computer and signing into all the websites we work with."
good,"great workplace for a work from home job"
good,"Everyone very helpful, called to check occasionally.  We try to get you a nice assignment. Would go to bat for you if need be."
good,"The over all co is a great place to work.  Great benefits. training is well done.  The management team has a long way to go.  Some of them are not available for their team, and NEVER let you know when you have done a good job, only when you have made an error.  The stress level is high, pushing sales continually, goals are set very high  and almost impossible to meet."
good,"Culture is first and foremost at Indeed, which could be the biggest reason it is the #1 job worldwide. Senior leadership does everything they can to make every employee happy and come to work excited. They are also HIGHLY visible every single day, including the CEO. Offices are open floor plans, so no corner offices for the senior leadership. They sit all over the building and amongst all of the different teams in their departments. Managers are highly experienced in the digital media/digital advertising field so you are learning from the best of the best in the industry"
good,"Convergys was a good place to work taking phone calls was an everyday duty, i learned if you show respect you get it back co workers were great. What i enjoyed most was the incentives and bonuses."
good,"The job itself was not the most enjoyable due to the poor experiences with customers.  However, the workplace environment and co-workers a like brought much joy to the job and made it something to look forward to day in and day out."
good,Convergys is one of the top and established BPO Companies in Cebu. Worked  with them for 4 years and it's a great company to start with.
good,"--Answer high volume calls"
good,"This job was work from home which was a wonderful experience, until the first contract ended and I was transferred to a new contract which had never had any experience in training employees virtually. Also, the information that was given about being worked with if the requirements of the training were not met such as if you did not meet the handle time requirement you would be worked with until you met that requirement. As an overall experience it was great until the last few months when I was going thru training when I was promised help in learning the new material and never received it and was told I would not lose my job if the requirements were not met but instead I would be worked with more closely."
good,"This company overall is a good company, the pay is on par and the benefits just as well, but the lack of communication is something that was not well received by me, i have a disability but no one advised me that i would need a paper to be filled out by my doctor and then returned stating that i was disabled and to forgive absences that may have been due to my condition or the wheelchair, until it was to late, but  as i stated it is a very good company and with hard work and passion you can go a long way."
good,"The Call Center routine is a nice routine but ultimately wasn't the kind of routine I could really sink my teeth into."
good,"A typical day consists of coming in and signing in and getting straight to work.  The work was great, call center representative, got used to sitting a lot.  Management was unprofessional and the overall environment as well.  Other than that being a call rep. for Comcast was great.  I learned how to type much faster and speak better."
good,"Enjoy the experience that I am receiving with the job and this helps to advance towards my career and the more that I can receive from within the job, the better my skills become"
good,"I love working here there are some minor things that the company can change as far as the point system , I love the environment and the people"
good,"Being quality analyst daily refresher session use to be done with the team"
good,"If you want your first taste of call center experience, this is the perfect place to work. Management at times have personal issues written on their  face."
good,"era un poco estresante por que aveces no me ponían a hacer trabajos relacionados con mis practicas como asistente administrativo, me ponían a llevar cartones al chut."
good,"Company provided opportunity for growth. Great for first time applicants and lots of overtime was available. Training was made available and instructors were great.  This company uses a point system so if you aren't a timely person, either you learn to become one or employment here is not for you."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"This is a great place to work if stress isn't an issue for you. On a daily basis you experience stressful phone calls at a high volume as well as complicated scripts to read from in order to assist customers. The benefits as far as I'm concerned are the sugary icing placed upon this dry and unappetizing cake called ""Convergys"" At this organization they expect you to do the job of 4 different reps in 1. You handle billing, programming, sales and troubleshooting all for a low price as far as I'm concerned your salary isn't adequate for what the job you perform on a regular basis."
good,The managers are all great. The bonuses are nice and there is a good chance of advancing. However the hours are all over the place the days off are never the same. the training is very in depth and for computer friendly people very easy to get with
good,Enjoyed the people and the management.  Alot of pressure but it all worked out to be a very relaxed place to be because of the support from co-workers.
good,If the program you were hired in is gone you can be laid off in a heart beat. As well as if you advanced it one program they will get ride of you if needed
good,"Typical day at work- I come in starting at 8, take calls until my first 15 min break at 10:05 am then I am back on the phones taking calls back to back until my 1hr lunch at 12:35pm then I come back at 1:35pm which I am still on the phone until my last 15 min break at 3:05pm which i'm taking back to back calls until I punch out at 5:00pm. "
good,"Convergys was a great job, I met new people (not just over the phone) The hardest part of the job is just you getting frustrated with the customers but the enjoyable part of the job was talking and meeting with new people"
good,"Es una compañía que procura cuidar al cliente Norteamericano prestando un servicio de comunicación móvil a través de un outsourcing que funciona en Colombia, se aprende mucho a comunicarse con los clientes y guiarlos hacia una solución objetiva. Es un trabajo autónomo con supervisor, la parte difícil es el manejo de los horarios pues son muy extenuantes y extrictos. Pude practicar y afianzar mis habilidades de comunicación verbal, escrita, lectura y comprensión en ingles en un entorno laboral real."
good,LOVED THE JOB.  GREAT WORK ATMOSPHERE.Advancement in the company was akey value.
good,"Great benefits, great team I worked with. A typical day would consist of clocking in, tracking packages domestic and international and submitting varies cases."
good,"- A typical day at work included after arriving at least five minutes before you were scheduled, you would log in and pull up all of your systems and then log into your phone ready to take inbound calls. Then you would take your break, lunch, and then break at your scheduled times. Overall, you could take 80 to 120 calls a day depending on how busy that day was."
good,"The pay of the job overall is acceptable, but it depends on what your tolerance level is. I grew very anxious with this job worried how the next call would be like after receiving a really bad call, not to mention the fear of accidentally speaking to them again. They say its not possible, but it happened twice within two weeks of working there and not to mention a couple coworkers of mine ended up taking a call from some one I previously spoke to and vice verse. Now how would you feel if you had a person who threatened, and cursed you out, and then there is a slight chance you may speak with them again? You can say that they won't remember your name, but that is definitely not the case at all. They remember trust me. It was nice being able to just sit at a desk and just use your fingers, but all the sitting caused me to grow restless. I enjoyed making more than what I do usually and the benefits this job gave was great, but it wasn't enough to keep me there. I had to quit to leave me some form of sanity. This job is not for happy go lucky people who's life revolves around smiles."
good,"Technical support - we work hard but it is a fun place to work and the people there are so supportive. "
good,Overall GM or minacs has been very good to me and for me .I was able to choose my own schedule as well as get incentives and much needed raises. Although like any major corporation there is alot of strain and change I feel the mangers are easy to work with very professional and understanding . Hardest part of my day is disappointing a customer especially when its just the business and not maybe that they truly deserved our help. I most enjoyed coming to work everyday with a diverse and awesome group of people everyone is helpful and majority of the time prepared to work and in a positive mood.
good,"Researching on various technical aspects and troubleshooting issues pertaining to Windows-based operating systems – Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7."
good,"The team managers were great to work for , very personable and willing to help you out , even with personal  or family issues"
good,"Fun people to work with, but can be stressful.  This company was very help full when working and going to school.  However, individuals need to be flexible due to changing company needs."
good,"Learned troubleshooting for Office and windows."
good,"Convergys is a call center that is contracted out by different companies to handle their calls. When I worked there I was on the Fannie Mae Team and handled their clients calls on seeing if they were eligible to have their homes refinanced instead of being foreclosed."
good,"It's a good company and the money is awesome, but there are a lot of hypocritical things that go on there. Our trainer would tell us one thing in our classroom training but then once we got out on the floor, she would completely contradict herself. I learned how to manage a lot more systems on a computer at once and how to conduct myself on the phone. I loved a lot of the people I did meet there. They were really friendly and supportive."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"It was a fun loving place where only serious minded could learn from being in the team -- communication skills, accent developement etc"
good,I liked that my hours were the same everyday but I didn't like answering phones to complaining customers everyday yelling at me for something that wasn't my fault. I handled it but it wasn't my favorite job. I didn't really get to interact with people and I didn't like that.
good,Company provides excellent management that assist you on a day to day basis to be able to gain the knowledge that is required to assist your customer.
good,"Busy days"
good,"good place to work, great people ,easy to adjust shift times and days, benefits, holidays, good pay"
good,on night i was alone in the floor of BPO (Bengal Circle) and management said that I've manage all the call for whole night. it was very difficult task for any one of the associate but I Succeed  and manager welcomes and thanks for my success.
good,"Convergys is a job, it helps plenty for needing one and the company itself will hire you as long as you know how to use a computer in some way/form.  Training consists of a few weeks, mainly getting familiar with the work environment as well as seeing how long you last. Generally training wasn't much demanding or intense in the least bit.  In short, learn the policies, systems and just how to approach someone on the call.  "
good,a typical day at Convergys will be answering customers question about new equipment  and up sale on program. I learn about the new technology that's out in the world today I enjoy my customers  
good,"Always had support, over worked, learned different personalitys, hardest part was always working over the amount of hours that you were paid for. "
good,Working at Convergy was a great experience. It helped me to learn better to work with commission based jobs and sales. It was also my first call center job.
good,Any typical workdays is really good.
good,Receive in bound phone calls all day. Help customers fix issues with cell phones.
good,Majority of the management staff were new and weren't very professional.
good,"A typical day at work would be answering phone calls from customers having issues with their internet/cable services. I learned how to multitask and use time management very well. The co-workers were fun and energetic. The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers, having trouble with their cable/internet services it required patience and self control. The most enjoyable part of the job had to be fixing the customers issues, the sense of relief from the customer made me feel that I done my job correctly."
good,"Not a position for everyone. Personal discipline is required to be accomplished in a ""call center"" atmosphere."
good,"Working here is good for someone who does not get bored easily. The job itself is interesting enough, but overtime can become monotonous,"
good,a very fast paced environment . i learned a lot about mobile phones and the service.i dont have any complaints about the managers i had. i dont have any complaints about the coworkers. the flexivility of schedule .
good,It is a fun place to work. I enjoy the staff andp ther view on custoner service. The pay is less than I'm accustomed to.
good,"I assisted Capitol One card holders over the phone with any problems that they may have concerning their accounts, lowing their Apr, waiving fees, etc. I also had to retain the accounts meaning saving them from closure , use computers to enter, access or retrieve data, complete product and development training, I had to use sales techniques and identify the best product suite the customer needs."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,A mature quit work environment with employee friendly management.
good,I feel that this job was no fun. It was unorganized and very judgemental
good,"Although a nice workplace with friendly employees, it is a stressful workplace due to the requirements to reach certain statistics during calls and managing call volume. Extremely strict about maintaining statistics. HR department is not timely with requests, generally appears to not want to get involved with employees, also has terminated employees due to medical conditions and, in my opinion, unrealistic reasons."
good,"They pay good money for what your work is and how long you work but the people there make it hard to be there because they’re so drama filled, so I would advise for others to tale that into consideration and be strictly about work not to get too friendly with others because they aren’t your friends."
good,"Almost the experience was good"
good,"It's a multicultural place to work."
good,"This job could be used as a steppingstone  to learn many different call types for different jobs , to familiarize you to computers and keyboards and also working as a team."
good,"Concentrix is an ideal job if you are a very determined and driven person who doesn't mind being on the phone constantly for chunks of hours. At times there is seconds between calls and it can become very grating very quickly if you are not prepared. On top of this, the schedules are very all over the place and the 'weekends' are often in the middle of the week."
good,I met some amazing people my short time being there. The calls were a bit stressful and sometimes management was not fair about certain decisions that were made. But overall it was a nice experience
good,"Management needs to improve communication between TL/OM/HR and what information they're giving to agents on the floor. The biggest problem is there is so much mismatched information and different answers given depending on who you speak to. The atmosphere seems very collaborative and the management seems supportive, but just like everywhere else it has it's downfalls as well. They seem short staffed, especially during training and transition, but the other agents are willing to help and it is a supportive environment"
good,"Working through the AT&T project which was once Convergys, was a great experience! I was able to work my way up from a representative position to management."
good,"This is a typical call center job it does offer you at home work. This makes working in a call center so much more convenient. The training wasn't as good as it should have been, I was thrown out on the floor without knowing how to work thru all the programs."
good,"Concentrix was a great opportunity to work from home and learn about Apple products and technical support. The hours were not very flexible and management was was not always supportive. Overall, it was a decent experience."
good,Loved the job enjoyed my job enjoyed the people never had a problem and was very easy to do loved the managers and supervisors would recommend for anyone to work there
good,back to back calls. management not to good they but a lot of new people to manage you.Who dont have any kind of experience.The  most fun i have is helping people and putting a smile on there face.
good,"It has a great and friendly workplace environment. Everyone, specially managers, are always willing to help you whenever you need help. Everyday was an amazing day full of opportunities to learn something new and specially had the opportunity to help all customers that contacted us."
good,"Before it has been acquired by Concentrix, Convergys has been so good to me even before I started working for them. They hired me even they know the fact that I am pregnant, they trust me enough and I am very happy about it. The reason why I resigned is that before the turnover, people had been very toxic. Due to the heavy workload and people around the office doesn't seem to have it that time. Management is asking as to go under training to support another line of business but with the same hourly rate, we don't like the idea. Working for DTV alone is stressful we cannot afford to add another line of business which we will only pay the same as before, everyone needs a motivation to go through and to good to be true, its money. But the management doesn't seem to understand so we decided to leave the company."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"The Most enjoyable part of the job in Workforce, Every moment i feel very excited once i start playing in Excel. I have learned lots of thing here, and now i am certified Excel trainer."
good,"Answered inbound calls from customers, Helped with cell phone problems and answered questions about bill. Offered high speed internet as well as U-Verse TV."
good,"I’m a current employee with Concentrix. Although I enjoy my job, the schedule and scheduling process sucks. I have no time for anything else, because of my work schedule. I don’t think schedules should be made based on performance. It’s always to many changes to the way things are done. It’s kind of annoying."
good,"Great company, think you can work from home now. ITs a good experience if you need customer service experience. I do not recommend it forever, it can be stressful."
good,the companies facilities and security is really good but when it comes to carrer growth it is really slow and there pantry and shower rooms are huge and there’s a lot of choices when it comes to food
good,"Definitely educated on Diectv"
good,Overall the act of the job was not difficult. Management is poor at communication. If they tell you they will work around your school schedule... They wont
good,"You really just have to be a people person to enjoy this job. Everyone is just doing their job, even the supervisors that yell at you. The callers can be rude but your supervisors always ask for your side. They're never quick to attack you for caller complaints. You get a lot of discounts and benefits. You have a steady paycheck and, for the most part, job security. They have a lot of cute little activities for employees. They change your schedule minimal times if at all so you have a set schedule. It's a nice environment, just the calls can be stressful. Sometimes they can be strict about where you sit, even if you do your job really well."
good,if you dont mind customers yelling at you through the phone then this is a great place to work. The pay is alright but you dont get a whole lot of training in the beginning.
good,Constantly answering phone.  Do stay busy. Got incentive bonus on sells.  Recognition for number of accts setup.  Enjoyed the supervisors.  Had good training for six weeks.  Great trainer.
good,"Fun workplace, dayshift schedule, but salary is not enough plus a stressful PPH target. In just two months, our target gets high and it is unreachable"
good,It's a time of flux in their industry.  That is the primary reason I would consider somewhere else to work.  But my experience with my team and management has been great.
good,Temporary job that was constantly stressful and very little knowledge provided. expectations were high. the personality was different but always dreaded going to work
good,"Regimented with set breaks and lunch breaks. Call center with a lot of quality and customer service skills being the main concerns, along with following procedure and protocols set in place. Nice people to work with and an understanding and helpful management staff. A typical day entails answering the basic customer service for healthcare concerns from consumers."
good,"This job was the most fun I have had. The people are great and Supervisors are hard working fun people. However with that being said. Once tax season ends, hours are cut and can barely afford to eat and pay bills. 6 hour shifts  monday thru friday doesnt cut the mustard. Thats the only complaint i have. Very fun enivorment."
good,"since the morning when i got there i would simply sit, log onto my computer and take calls. my calls are long and productive many members called for benefits on there healthcare plan and others were to dispute claims and hospital bills. the most enjoyable part of the job was letting members know that they were covered for many must needed operations that made them happy."
good,"Its an industry where you cant work for long due to health issues."
good,"I'm working on a graveyard shift. It's fun, exciting and full of adventure but it's really tiring. You will always feel sleepy at work much more after work. I don't like the way my body reacted to this job."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"If it were not my shift permanently ending at 3 AM it could have been much better for everyone..."
good,"It is a slow pace if you like sitting down all day this is the job for you, but will have inconsistent days. Such as one day have many calls and other days have none."
good,"The job is easy, but its a lot of just sitting for hours. Not good for someone who is used to and prefers to be moving around a lot. Other than that is good. There is unlimited over time and you start accruing PTO and UTO your first day of training."
good,"Great work environment, Great hours, laid back place. Only problem is they do not pay enough compared to other call centers. People there are very relaxed and understanding of personal life issues as well"
good,La empresa está en una exc localización también pude aprender y tener experiencia no hay posibilidad de crecer y moverse de cuenta los salarios son normales
good,"A typical day at work in Convergys consisted of sitting at a cubicle and beginning to take in your inbound calls. It was a fast paced environment with team orientation. There was a lot of interaction between chat rooms and seating."
good,I was working for Blue Cross Blue Shield through convergys. I love to help out others. It was a great experience to learn the knowledge behind the billing and benefits when it comes down to your doctors expenses. I was a great life lesson.
good,Convergys is actually a very good company for me.It helped me in soo many ways either financially even self-realization. The account where I was profiles is very challenging in my part (since I handled financial account) since as we all know that everyone is very sensitive when it comes to finances.
good,"Good Company ...."
good,"the work was steady, and once you get the hang of it, you can be pretty proficient. They were expanding rapidly, put effort and you will promote. The job itself can be monotonous. And they are a company, so they are strict with their policies"
good,I would like to join Concentrix in future if I get the chance. Good work environment always 1st crieteria for me.....salary also a criteria but if ur manager is supportive then it is always good for work
good,Must explain how to create a internet connection to non-computer literate customers. A lot of the calls are repeat calls so to gain the customers confidences in your ability is challenging because they already don't understand and have been told wrong by our co-workers
good,Job in Concenix is very hard. We use to do the calls around 120 in a day. Customer escalation is tough to handly over the email and also over the call. Management is supportive in Cocentrix
good,Not enough training. Managers & co-workers were pleasant but were treated too strictly. I was not given full training experience needed for the job. It was a good experience to have studied some parts about the job.
good,"It's a literal work zone area. I come to work, not much making friends.  What I learned from this job is that if you want to earn more and get promoted, give all your effort, time and commitment for the job assigned to you. Don't be too emotionally attached with customers especially if they are bragging on you because next customer might get affected of my emotions too. The management is actually great. I got a lot of coverage for health, they treat the employees fairly, the workplace is secured. The hardest part of the job would be exhausting all my efforts for the customer but still the concern hasn't been resolved because of internal procedures that we have to adhere. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is getting the hang of different people's moods and behavior."
good,Convergys cares about it's employees and provides opportunities for growth and promotion. The management staff works to develop talent and provide a good work/life balance.
good,"Concentrix is a Nice Company to work. "
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"It was fun but a bit hassle beacuse of the schedule that they had. But overall, im happy that they give a chance to be a part of their company. Im happy that they give me so much confidence."
good,BPO company that offered good pay for entry level. Good place to build on CS and leadership skills. Need to be flexible with BPO Scheduling and quality reviews.
good,"Working in a call center is not an easy tasks, you need to report to work while your relatives and friends do seize the night. Need to report to work even though your sick, they can only allow a matter of death situation"
good,"Good environment to work..Safe place to work..Much  to learn..Interesting to work..friendly atmosphere."
good,You either love your job here or you hate it. There doesn't seem to be much middle ground. it's a good environment but management sucks but I met some good people there.
good,Good benefits/ work environment in Convergys Corp could be stressful at times. Must learn how to handle difficult customers on the daily basis. Must meet with the monthly stats to meet goal.
good,"Going to the office will make you feel excited because you know that it is the time to talk and answer peoples inquiry thru phone."
good,the training was the overwhelming part for me because i was a new mom but overall i loved the experience everyone was polite and helpful the sercurity is great
good,"This job was good, but not the best. I was selling DirecTV and it got really difficult. I ended up with a lot of angry customers calling every single day. The shifts were long because we had to do mandatory overtime and it made it longer with people screaming at you all day. It was difficult, but my coworkers were awesome!"
good,"Good place to works , very accommodating for a student schedule. Good culture. Convergys welland is a good part time place or full time.  They are very accommodating"
good,"I worked there at night shift. i've learned alot of things, about CSR. the management is pretty good and the working place is so nice. the hardest part of the job is to deal with sleepiness. because its my first time working in a call center that's why i hardky adjust myself on it. the most enjoyable part of the job is i made a lot of friends and whenever its the time of critical hour, the management is giving us chocolotes. :D"
good,Workplace is very cool..i have been working with this from last 7 years.funplace for work. I have learned many things from this.now i want day shift..shift is very long.
good,"Working with convergys was satisfying at first, but soon got aggravating. when you first got to work everybody had a free for all for a computer, and never had the right pieces at the desk. I learned a good deal about electronics and how to fix and problem solve the best way."
good,"The company offers  great opportunity before I am unsure now,  BUt still I am glad and thankful that I've been part of the  company for  almost 4 years."
good,"At work was a busy day, lots of customers. I learned how to take my time out for each customer. Management was nice, they sometimes weren't there. The workplace was okay. People said they saw bugs, which had me worried. The hardest part was being there at 5am.I like the job becasue they worked with my school hours."
good,"I enjoyed working with my team mates and other employees."
good,"Good company, however there are still room for improvements. Training should be longer especially for a csr post / sales and technical support. 3 weeks isnt enough to learn everything. I suggest to make it longer and put good trainers."
good,"The opportunity to learn about a breadth of technologies such as routing, switching, voice over IP, public switched telephone network (PSTN) telephony, fax over IP, cordless phones, desk phones, softphones, analog telephone adapter, eFax, automatic call distributors (ACD), auto-attendants (AA) is there. But, there is limited opportunity to expand your current skill set after mastering it for the first few months."
good,"My experience at Convergys was bitter sweet. Although i did not enjoy this environment i would rather not speak badly about the company. I was terminated without reason on my day off. This was my first termination ever and I wish i would have known why so, i could improve what went wrong working here."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Good summaries however I'm not sure how to get the information in the proper date range.  I'm still able to follow the pages to locate the job information I need.
good,Great time but main account is a pain. They change the metric that is most important weekly which is a pain however the schedule is more or less stable and their support people are really good.
good,It was easy job. The only thing that I didn't like was when the people was very rude on the phone. But I had to make sure at the end of the day the customers was satisfied and got what they needed. But other thing was going smooth.
good,"Good management team, co-workers and environment. Daily work is processing claims and sending out reports. The team at Mazda Headquarters is always working together and mature."
good,"For starting your career company is very nice and healthy environment ,no work load all the good thing that you can think of is there"
good,a typical day at work is just  logging in and taking in calls as a retention agent you need to make sure to save customers and keep their Business with Dish Network. I learned a lot about handling a Team and how to keep a business on a Managerial perspective all of my co-workers are great one of the main reason why I will have  a hard time in leaving the company is because of the people around me and the environment. hardest part of the job though is the schedule.
good,The company culture is great.  Everyday is challence it will improve you on how to interact with clients.  The trainings are also great and very work related.
good,fun and laid back environment. no negativity in work place. very flexible  work schedule. great pay and great benefits.
good,"-inbound and outbound calls relating to getting customers scheduled for their annual eye exams"
good,A typical work day was fun and went by fast. Everything and everyone was very professional. I enjoyed working with my coworkers and management
good,"Overall the job is a decent job; however, the work environment is terrible. My co-workers were very loud and rambunctious. The team work is alright, but I felt as if I was being judged on my performance after a few days of being on the production floor. The training is amazing."
good,"The job itself was ok, however there is not enough staff at this location. I did 6 weeks of training, when I got on the floor everything I was taught was incorrect. When I needed help there wasn't anyone around, and even though I would try to help the customer as much as I could, I would get in trouble for asking for help. This was the worst job I ever had, and everyone in my training class quit as well."
good,"Trabalhava com cobrança de inventários,ambiente de trabalho muito bom, mas descoordenada e confusa em algumas decisões."
good,"answering calls on an inbound role, learnt new systems enjoyed meeting new people and gaining friends, no hard parts about this job, management were very fair and understanding"
good,"Kollegen in einen Projekt sind immer super,man hat Spaß jemand zum reden und guten Kontakt zueinander"
good,"All kinds of people of all walks of life work there, just like any other day make sure to be on time and clock in to your ID number and open your troubleshooting programs (8 I think), Typical day resulted in 50 or 70 inbound calls about how the service was bad and how they (the customers) had charges to their accounts that they and their kids were not aware of. the most joy got out of the job was sitting next to the friends I had made during my training."
good,"My work is fun because it allows you to interact to people through phone. In this industry, integrity is much needed because what at stake is the finances of other people. When it comes with the management of the company. it's totally great. They give considerations with people that has personal issues, like being sick. The work environment is totally awesome, especially your workmates. They will also feel responsible for you when you are in need. The only complicated part of the job is when the customer is threatening to end their usage and trying to transfer to another providers. We fully understand that, as a Customer Representative, it is our duty to satisfy our customers needs and wants but there are some that takes the advantage just to have credits to lower their bill. But, whenever there is a happy customer during my service and completely satisfied, I also feel satisfied for that."
good,"A typical day at convergys, starts with you clocking in. They have a point system in which if you reach 12 points you are terminated. If you are 5 minutes past your scheduled hour you are considered late and are given .25 points. After you clock in you log onto your phone and programs and start answering calls. I learned a lot of communicating skills and listening skills. The management at convergys is good, but sometimes the managers or TL's have favoritism so that was something that upset me. The co-workers at convergys were great you make friends in that company fast. The hardest part of the job was when it was call after call and sometimes we would get angry customers back to back, but i would always handle the situation well. I would always make a angry customer a happy one and that was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"I enjoyed my work at Minacs, I have gained more experience and learn new techniques to overcome issues in payroll. I also learned in and out of Peoplesoft. My manager was amazing to me she put me on projects and I have achieved to finish all my projects I was advised to do. The most enjoyable part was the trust that my manager had for me and the support she gave me the time I was there."
good,"Hires under false pretenses, told me completely different schedule upon hire. Found out later that schedule was in PT."
good,Simple as long as you learn and keep up with knowing how to use device technology and assisting customer with there issue and resolving it promptly it was an easy day.
good,great job to have for someone who doesn't mind sitting for a while. The attendance policy is very strict but flexible at the same time. I enjoyed working with others and the customers are very sometimes hard but only hard as you make them.
good,Wasn't liking the way the managers (TL's) were treating the employers. Loved working there but once management starts showing they don't care there's not much you can do.
good,The productivity of Convergys is very good  and time to time it is going good. On the other hand it is also very fun workplace like the canteen and the events that held there everything.
good,"Recruitment team was very supportive, they considered delays for some requirements with valid reasons that's really appreciated. With the training team, they provided good modules , they understood each one of has a training curved. They always make sure everyone understood each process and products while on training. All coaches, team leaders, managers are all compliant, supportive, open."
good,According to me minacs is the good place for work but there is no growth for agents who is working as a customer service associate level.the work pressure is very much high sometimes and  sometimes low there was no balance work for the agents.compare to salary the work load is very much in outbound but the team leader  was supportive.company has provided good facilities for the agent but some times the security camera also not working properly due to that there was chances of stolen of our belongings.
good,"My original employment was with Stream Global Services, a BPO that was acquired by Convergys. Because of the merger there was a lot of confusion regarding what would stay and what would go -in terms of health benefits, leadership positions, etc- but the client was very straightforward in their guidelines for how they wanted their callers handled. A typical day consisted of handling inbound SiriusXM-related calls and, if scheduled for it, walk around the production floor to help other agents. I learned a lot about passive upselling from this job; since the job was technically a customer service one we were discouraged from being too aggressive in pushing services on the caller and am thus very grateful for the lessons in subtle sales that I learned here. The management was constantly in disarray because the corporate leadership wasn't very good at trickling down information to our site, but they managed as best as they could. There was a rather unprofessional vibe on the production floor because there is a pretty big turnaround rate at this site, but professionalism aside my coworkers were all very sweet. The hardest part of the job was having to take calls when the servers crashed because even though we still had to answer the calls and do our best to help the customers, we'd have to do so without any access to their accounts or any other web based resources. Since I worked in a department that was devoted to almost entirely to servicing preexisting customers, most of them were satisfied with the service and thus were a pleasure to talk to, making the calls themselves the most"
good,I did customer service and maintained customer satisfaction. I also was trained for technical support for situations with the customers satellite. The hours were great and I worked around many people.
good,"Not for everyone but great co workers and managers are down to earth."
good,"The work day changed everyday. The typical day would consist of me troubleshooting cable/internet lines, telephone and home security systems. I learned how to assist customers with effective information to get their systems back up and running. Management relied more on the knowledge of their workers. The coworkers were not the easiest people to work with. Everyone had their own personal opinions not related to the task at hand. The hardest part of the job would be the ever changing schedule and being able to adapt to weekly schedule changes. The most enjoyable part of the job was having a new experience."
good,"most management is awesome and there are some amazing coworkers! As far as work goes depends on the work flow sometimes fast and then sometimes its slow, customers can range from being the nicest to the meanest depends on there day. The hardest part of the job I would say is not being able to be blunt with certain customer. The most enjoyable is I get to know about different areas and cultures and personalities."
good,Awesome place to work receiving and taking calls for people placing orders
good,"very good response from customers "
good,A typical day here is getting your supplies knowing what floor you have to be on introduce yourself when going into patients rooms and cleaning  their room and also making sure lobby is clean. I learned how to stay organized as an individual the management was ok co workers was something to get use to the hardest part was having a script when going to patients rooms and the enjoyable part was having great benefits/
good,"Every job has it problems, but overall this was a good place to work."
good,"Typical day: You come in and are able to log in 5 mins early. You talk to customers all day; some rude, some nice. I was a repair agent so first I was in internet then we switched to cable repair. The pay is decent and you can do as much overtime as you want most of the time. Culture is fine most times but is fast paced and things are always changing. So be prepared for change. Its all manageable though."
good,"For the time I was employed, the training was awesome and informative.  All members of management, were friendly and helpful."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,I loved this job. I made a lot of money working here. great experience
good,I was able to apply my phone skills and customer service professionalism.
good,it was ok.The hardest part of the job was remembering 10 passwords.
good,"Typical Day : When there is work load"
good,Working at At&t Blue call center was a little different.  I came into the center at  the wrong time.  Management did not follow the rules they wanted us to follow. AThe center as a whole was not meeting the goals.  Causing the whole entire center to shut down.
good,This job isn't for everyone. It is stressful and demanding. I learned how cope with the demands and stress. The management team are great. Most of my co-workers were unprofessional and others were professional but kept to themselves. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with angry customers and having to listen to co-workers' foul language. The most enjoyable part of the job was how fun the trainers made the classes.
good,"A typical day at Convergys was sometimes challenging seeing that they hired a lot of younger people, but overall it was a great company to work for ."
good,"The management and colleges we're all nice. They made the work more bearable. Management made sure to check in on how everyone is doing at least once a week and encourage you to keep on trying. They also give you great pointers and tips to be better at your job. The breaks and lunches were a bit short, but from time to time they would lengthen it based on what's going on. Also I really liked their point system on how they make sure you can have sick days or what not. Also they're software to get days off and keep track of your work schedule 3 to 4 weeks in advanced really helped me especially when I needed to make sure I get off the days for my Orthodontist appointments. Taking calls one after the other was quite difficult to get the hang of, but luckily they let you split up your breaks however you'd like as long as you don't go over the time limit."
good,"Troubleshooting peoples phones. "
good,"Being a OM intern is great I have learned not only how to coach and develop team members also learned how to coach and develop supervisors. "
good,It's a very exciting and comfortable job. It just wasn't fro me...
good,"Very flexible place to work for students and mothers. Training is the best part, and you get paid for it."
good,"Pay Rate is great! Very Unorganized, does not work well employees, not too understanding, security is very aware, a clean environment."
good,Better than not having a job minacs is a call center and a great place to start a new job
good,I needed to listen and pay attention to every subscribers need call after call. The hardest part of my job was to ensure the subscriber was satisfied throughout the call and that the call was completed as quickly and as proficiently as possible.
good,The benifits are a great advantage while working for this company.
good,"I learned a lot at Convergys, how to help and handle customers in a way that benefits the customer and the company. My co-workers were great to work with. Some of the management was great and there was other parts of the management that wasn't great to work with. I did not see myself working at Convergys."
good,"dealt with unhappy people alot and had to satisfy there wants and needs. How to do the billing, activations, disconnections and help the customers if they were having problems with services. Managment was always there if customer wasnt satisfied with what i could offer and they would be able to talk to them. My co-workers were friendly and would ask questions if they needed help. The hardest part of the job was dealing with upset customers. The enjoyable part of the job was being able to help the customers."
good,Good with training they make sure you are prepared before you are put on the floor to handle daily operations.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Working in Convergys was fun. I go to work, my boss is very attentive to his agents.. my workmates are fun to work with.. there are team-buildings and the management is really good.. they organize our schedules really well... I have learned to handle and be with different types of people.. I have learned how to think out of the box to ensure that the customers get the best solution to their problems and most of all I have learned how to work hard and be excellent in what I do."
good,a typical day:- once the working tools get stuck in between almost 2 hours we were sitting idle.
good,Excellent Health Insurance Package :) Very job description due to the fact that the account is only a Chat Support account.
good,The work environment was very relaxed and friendly. The rules were established very clearly and any colleague able to help seemed to always offer their assistance.
good,"Converys was a nice place to work.Clean facility,and a friendly enviorment.I felt very comfortable going to work there."
good,Fun place to work with good work and life balance and salary compensation.
good,I learned to mutitask while accepting phone calls and also how to excel while being on a team. The best part about the job was the the hours which allowed me to work my other job as well.
good,"Overall a good job, friendly people, in work cafeteria, legal amount of manditory breaks, and nice management, but the managements communication can go haywire sometimes as said with me. They have a n 3 days, i did not miss any days but before that i told them i had something planned in a month, i was led to believe they would make an exception but no they we not notified by the person who hired me so i had the options aof quitting and possibly coming back in 6 mk onths of being fired and never allowed to work there again. If you go work there make sure they know . Tell as many manags as you have around you."
good,"So far so good. They have a lot of benefits, pay could be better along with the hours. I like the professional setting and how everyone seems friendly. My advice would be to come in learn your job and stay to yourself. There are a lot of guidelines to follow but it’s a job"
good,I was  laid off from this job. But before that happen this job was amazing to work at. The people and atmosphere was amazing. I learned how to do so many things and the advancements were amazing.
good,"It is good to be part of the company, i learned a lot from it and enjoy the ambiance,thats all........................................................"
good,For the most part I enjoyed my time there. My only real issue is the compensation when there is an issue with the computer or the system so you can work.
good,"It would be very easy to find worse jobs for less money. That said, this job isn't exactly a picnic. It will challenge you in ways you probably have not even imagined. Your patience, endurance, resolve, will-power, and problem-solving skills will all be tested time and time again. This is the perfect place to fertilize your resume."
good,"I could not have asked for better coworkers. I could not have asked for better managers. The people were great."
good,Convergys is a great place to work and get many experiences I learn accounting payroll HR work and the three years I was there doing IOP IOP4A QBO QBOA
good,"It’s an ok job . Sometimes back to back calls. Co workers were friendly. Trainers are awesome, place for growth as well . Sometimes you pto are denied which is annoying and if u have an emergency sometimes they will work with you so u don’t get a point for missing work"
good,Good help for great opportunity for us..no work load and no harresment. Office culture is very good and staff also good. Security is tight... Salary issue always
good,"Concentrix in my area had two different lines of business. It is a contract company. Management was alright, like in most companies, some are better than others."
good,"The people you are going to work with here are approachable. They would gladly address your concerns. About the job culture, it is laid back and there is no need to spend lots of money on business attires."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,If u use the tools given it's a great place to work but it's not very flexible butbif u do have sick days they help if not used all at once so I feel it's a great place to work
good,"Depending on the project it may be enjoyable."
good,"Easy to be overlooked, must be an exceptional worker and a bright star to move up in the company. Like most retail work the best and worst part of the job is the customers, very good people/social skills are needed"
good,"I learned how to improve my speaking skills and to boost my confidence with the help of my team leader."
good,"Fast paced when you got a call, I often felt like I had to rush through a call to get the customer off the phone quickly so I could move on to another call. Didn't feel like I was able to treat the callers as people and not quotas"
good,"Call Center"
good,"I enjoyed working there for the most part, under certain team leaders. Sometimes, the weekly performance reviews could be intimidating, and overwhelming. You would be required to listen to a call you took, and give your good points and weak points. Once I was under team leaders that understood how much I disliked this, they would review basics I could do to improve, and my goals for the next week. The pay was excellent, but you take a lot of calls from angry customers, so be prepared to have a thick skin, while being very nice and calm. You are also pushed to sell and upgrade, which is sometimes not so easy with certain customers. Overall, I would work there again."
good,there was okay they could do better. some of the manger had favorite be they like. I like they had pto . and love working with dtv we was paying 20 dollars a month for dtv services
good,As a company contrextrix is very advance... I m proud that concentrix  is my first work place.. I m learning day by day.. I like the rules and regulations made by concentrix..
good,I was working as a manager in convergys solution as a manager and manage all the activities including follow up and taking interviews of new employss also guiding and giving them training.
good,The God place to work with. Time is suitable as we are bachelors. The work there is good as we know every Stepid how to get the work done. The daily targets very met easily.
good,"As it was IBM before, it continued with the same policies and procedures but can never be equal to IBM."
good,Nice place to work. They are infested with bed bugs so I do not feel safe. But other than that it is a fine plaxe to work. The management is nice and we are all about team work making the work place a better place.
good,The management is good in term of salary and benefits of employees. I learned a lot of thing like can worked under pressure handled irate customers. Its really fun talking to customer and provide the resolution that they need.
good,I have more than 5 years of experience working in recruitments and have recruited candidates across levels in BFSI and ITES sector
good,"Ambiente lavorativo giovanile e accogliente"
good,It was a easy and wonderful job. Just to much talking on the floor and drama. Also many people fighting outside. Not a lot of diverse culture to me
good,Fun place to work and learn about technical products as well as providing customer service for different customers for a variety of products and situations
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"in my experience, Call center job. average pay... great community of workers. good team leaders and proper work ethics."
good,"Convergys is a great place to work when coming to the pay wise. I love my members, also. I'm here to help my members who on the other end of the phone.  There's people in this world we are here to help and they are the reason why we smile."
good,Usually I work 5 hours a day since this job is a part time job only. My stay at Convergys taught me to be patient with our respondents who tend to be cranky and annoying sometimes. I also get to enhance my communication and interpersonal skills. The management has been to good to its emloyees and always make sure to hear out their comments at work. The hardest part of the job is probably dealing with our 20-minute break for the entire duration of the shift while getting to interact with different people even over the phone only is probably the most enjoyable yet challenging part. Not to mention that my co-workers are also fun to be with.
good,World Class environment because My work station is official Google office.The most enjoyable and unforgetable part of the job because this is my first job of my life.
good,working here it teaches us to have great customer service so we can proceed to other jobs and do excellent.  Down fall is that were putt in situations where were kind of own our own when dealing with escalation calls.  Good side is that when dealing with angry customer all the time it teaches us strategies on to calm an situation down.
good,"Productive workplace"
good,"My overall experience towards Convergys is excellent, is just that I have to leave their company because of some family and relocation issue.s"
good,"Easy job, month and a half of full time pay, plentiful breaks, but when I was working there they began to stop any sort of 'time filler' type activities. We had to stop reading, drawing or writing, which made the day drag on behind a desk. When call flow was slow or there was time between calls, we basically had to just sit there, if we didn't have any friends or co workers sitting nearby it made the day drag on longer. There was also little to nothing you could do if you had a customer who had become irritate or insulting. I have had several calls in which I was nearly harassed and due to company policy I couldn't end the call or transfer without customer permission."
good,Base wages too low.  To much emphasis on sales and not enough on customer satisfaction.  Unrealistic sales quotas requirements that are not consistent with types of calls taken in call center
good,good. you get paid minim to lie to people. 5 days a week ladies and gents. lots and lots and lots of lying. the hours were reliable. i really did feel bad for some of the customers/
good,"A typical day at work come in greet my team, do payroll, live listening  and coach ,provide feedback, support ."
good,Very fun place to work at. Everyone was nice & polite. If you had any type of issue they would help you & would work with your schedule. Overall everything was pretty nice.
good,"Kitsap County - if you're not in the Navy or working for the hospital, you're either in retail or fast food. Sure, there are other decent full time opportunities, but this is a ""who you know"" community and these companies will hire an uneducated bartender over someone with a degree and experience because of who that person knows...so that said, Concentrix does hire pretty much anyone who applies as long as you complete their 6 week paid training course. They give you a chance at a sit-down job with career potential - you can advance to floor supervisor, coach, trainer, administration, etc. To me, that's a valuable contribution to this community. The majority of these trainees/new hires have no background in customer service or in dealing with management and strict attendance policies, and get terminated rather quickly, which is where most of the negative reviews are coming from. But if you can prove yourself through good work ethic, attendance and job performance, they offer generous bonuses and advancement opportunities. It's a tough job, call center work is not for everyone. But the camaraderie among the agents is great and the unlimited o/t is a blessing for me."
good,"Company could have just been ran a lot smoother, payroll issues, management issues. Just a bit much. Still haven't receive pay raise"
good,"They offer a stable full time employment with good benefits after 90 days but the calls are back to back, very repetitive and boring."
good,"This job I started in customer service, I handled over 100 inbound calls a day. I assisted valued customers in finding reasonable and obtainable solutions for issues related to personal credit cards. I was promoted to Small Business, I handled between 100 inbound calls to 150 inbound calls. These calls required crisis intervention, providing emergency services to customers, introducing new products that benefit businesses as well as routing the customers to appropriate channels when needed. I once again was promoted, this time to Senior account supervisor. This department was the retention department. I handled inbound transfer calls. I was in charge of credit counseling, rewarding higher credit limits or lower interest when earned. I provided excellent customer service that many more times than not, ended with a satisfied account holder."
good,At convergys your training was a 4-6 week course in which they tried to cover everything about the policy inside and out which isn't enough time for someone new to the field.
good,"This place was always very alive. Loud music, everybody was always hyper and ready to get the job done. Customers were interactive with the employees."
good,"Great place to work, and the pay is great, but make a small mistake and it will be very easy to loose your job. Just do what you're suppose to no matter what. In CRG you're meant to save the customers, so when doing that always make sure you make a valid save attempt."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"The workplace itself and the people there are great! the main thing that got to me was the over-night hours. was unable to maintain due to having a child/family to take care of. I learned all the ins, and outs of ATT wireless and troubleshooting. typical day at work was a little slow until the rush times between 1-3am when people started calling. would maintain avg 10-20 mins in-between calls."
good,Convergys is an alright place to work. Pay isn't great but they do offer 80% benefits. Im not to sure what else to write go get a job and find out
good,"* Determines requirements by working with customers."
good,"Very long days, and sometimes very horrible phone calls. Customers were not always the nicest, but as far as responsibilities at work went, they were not too bad at all. Overall it was a good job. Team leaders were always there to answer any questions we had. The only bad part was the hours. Typically worked 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. so it felt like all I ever did was work. It became my new home pretty much."
good,"I learned that one must follow the management teams rules instead of listening to coworkers ideas of how the team should have been handled.  Most coworkers were unprofessional in their conduct on the phones and with their peers and supervisors. Comfortable work environment, breaks and lunch hours were scheduled evenly so that your hours worked between breaks did not seem too long and tedious."
good,"i had a lot of fun working for convergys. "
good,"A typical day at work for many people who work there are call-avoiders. Many employees don't want to keep answering phone calls from customers who shouldn't have to deal with their services. "
good,"The first thing you do is log into your computer and log into all the operations you're going to be using. Then you wait for the calls to start."
good,"Aside from meeting different people and celebrities all the time, working in the airport was benefical. I would still be there if it weren't for a fall I had and then they were trying to do everything in their power to fire me, but i ressigned before they could."
good,"On a typical day at Convergys I handled about 200 incoming calls. Customers ranged from extremely rude to pleasantly cordial. I learned how to manage multi phones, while also switching through 3 to 4 programs at a time. Management was nice, but due to the over hire of employees, they could never relate on a personal level with each individual. The hardest part of the job was the difficult callers. the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to experience multiple solutions for each problem."
good,"I loved working for this company.  Unfortunately they have moved to the Phillipines."
good,walmart was an overall great job. I loved working there to see people it was a great customer service oriented job. My co workers were pretty awesome. Management wasn't all that great .
good,"Assisted customers with various applications and inquiries, including credit cards, life insurance, reverse mortgage plans, long distance and internet plans."
good,My job experience in Convergys was helpful in my development in handling different kinds of people and dealing with those with not so good characters. The management was okay especially the work place is very good. The schedule though was not very healthy but it was considerable. The pay as well is fine but I would need a job that has better pay.
good,"While working at Convergys a typical day would include, first completing the training. During the training period I sat in a classroom of about thirty people at a computer desk learning the basics of the different software programs that the company used. After becoming familiar with the software I would then learn to balance taking calls, assisting customers, pulling up their information, and navigating my way through their account to find ways to resolve their problems. Once training was complete I took these skills to the sales floor and helped customers calling in to complete the functions that they were requesting, such as bill payment, payment arrangements, adding and deleting features..etc. As a trainee the only manager I worked with was the classroom trainer. Once I began working on the sales floor I then had three call representative managers that would assist in any questions or help we had in assisting the customers. There was minimal interaction with co-workers being that we were taking calls back to back. The hardest part of the job was trying to encourage the customer to purchase items they may not have been financially able or willing to obtain. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to customers from all different types of background. "
good,"If you enjoy customer service this job is for you. Flexible hours, great benefits."
good,Awesome hours and pay. Working with different people was a plus also.
good,Good job nice people nice pay good job for college students.
good,"Working for Congverys was not the ideal job because I was in school and I couldn't study or anything, just focus on the customers, even if there wasn't any calls. The staff is very nice and motivating."
good,great place to gain experience and sales experience. I hated working weekends and I hated working holidays. it was the worst. the people were very mean and they did not work very well with my school schedule. it was just hard all over. the compensation was great though.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Great place to work and I would consider this a transitional option if you are wanting the call center experience
good,"customer service, delt with many angry customers, and sales weren't so great but it was a nice environment. very loud and crazy, chaotic, and enjoyable"
good,"It is a very good company..... but salary was not good,,,, I have some personal problems that the reason i leave the company."
good,There's literally nothing hard about this job. You pick up the phone assist a customer with basic needs and you go from there. Some employees get emotional and cry on the phone or accidentally curse on the phone which is a bit unprofessional but oh well
good,Great place to work. As long as you show up to shifts you will not get fired. They do very good at training before firing for making mistakes. Initial training is not effective needs to be more on the floor training
good,I liked the job but due to poor management I had to leave. But overall the job was easy enjoyed talking to customers over the phone..I would go back if I had the opportunity.
good,The work overall is stupid easy. As for when it comes to needing help or assistance with your computer they lack. Super Childish management. you sit all day
good,"Essentially the job is calling new customers all shift asking them how their experience was with whichever company I was calling for. I was given a script to follow and ask the questions one by one as the call continued. We were allowed to color while at the desk, but phones were not permitted while working. The job overall is very easy and pretty flexible on scheduling, but it began to feel very tedious for me after a few months of working there. It would be the same questions over and over again and it began to feel very draining. Calls could go very well, very stale, or very badly depending how what mood the customer is in. Some coworkers did enjoy the job though! I'd recommend working here if an office job is your thing. I'd also recommend working this job along with another job to switch up how you're making your money, as a desk job requires you to not be moving around."
good,"A typical day at work is that you set on the phones all day. However, you do get two 30 mins and one 15 mins break. I learned the history of nike. The management is good depending on who you have. The workplace culture is good. The hardest part of the job is the hours changing from full to part time hours often. The most enjoyable part of the job is the breaks and some phone calls."
good,Good workers to work with but low compensation. Nice office but the time of the shift is not that good. Low incentives. most enjoyable part is when you give a refund or replacement to customers
good,I loved everyone that I worked with and the job itself was great as far as incentives and advancements. But the job is so stressful on the phones. It was very rough to sit there and answer phone call after phone call daily and seldom be able to get up from your desk other than your 2 breaks and lunch. I had a lot of upset customers I had to calm down that were very nasty to me. The environment is also very micro-managed. There are so many numbers that have to be met and if you have to get up to use the bathroom too much outside of your break it could affect those numbers. At one point phone calls had time limits and it was rough trying to solve the customers problem while staying within a 2-3 minute time limit.
good,"This is not a typical 9 to 5 job.  It also requires a certain type of person to work here.  It can be a great place to work in regards to benefits and moving up.  However, it can be stressful with the phone calls that you may receive from customers.  It is a difficult job to have with children."
good,"Convergys is a good job, but for the pay, they require a strict schedule. The team leads there are unprofessional and are not always around when needed."
good,"Great place to work great environment. Relaxed, relaxed dress code, fair break times, incentives for meeting expectations ( gift cards, televisions, and more!"
good,"Day at work is good, Management is good."
good,This company gives me the idea on how to dress corporately and to use English language as its major dialect that made my communication effective . A company were employee uses its diversity to communicate effectively.
good,"Afternoon to Midnight work schedule, i learned a lot, being able to to work on time and accurately, manage to maximize my time on work, good culture, people are friendly and approachable, hardest time is Overtime for almost 2 months, most enjoyable time is being with friends, having team building."
good,"I've learned alot from this company. the workplace is good, its like your second home and all the people are fun to be with. Most enjoyable part of the job when you have a team building or team lunches."
good,Nice place to work and have fun at the same time. Management  is understanding. But you will have  pressure in month ends to support your team and process in some processes.
good,"Excellent working atmosphere, low stress work. The company paid the semester tuition of workers who were college students with good grades. Decent pay and good benefits. But the call center tends to come and go from one place to another quite quickly."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"In the beginning I took customer calls and solved problems, after that got promoted to help desk. and started training new  employees"
good,Management is fun to be with. It's just the start time of the work that makes it toxic and stressful. Salary is quite big for a fresh grad.
good,"Pay is amazing. They really try to do their best to keep employees happy. Bought us food sometimes, always upbeat personalities from just about everyone. Fun place to work for what it is."
good,Was trying to figure out to do things that my floor trainer didn't even know. It got stressful being there when the help you wanted was there. You had to learn fast or it would be a challenge. I think it would of been easier if my group had someone that knew what they were doing on the floor. She gave her best but you could tell it was also overwhelming for her too!
good,"Great job for Students and easy advancements. Great atmosphere, Fun events always happening and easy commission. Enjoyed the People and education."
good,the job itself is ok nothing bad about it other than the irate customers that call daily but they management isn't all that good they say they will work with oyu for things and they really don't but the incentives are really good
good,Took incoming calls all day for 8-10 hour days. Dealt with customers payments. Customer complaints would be dealt with us but if escalated were put through to a supervisor. Supervisor listened to our calls and would rate us. Got rewarded for good calls.
good,"The scheduling was horrible had to change up schedules every three months, benefits were good and my supervisor was awesome"
good,Within this job I learned that everyone has their own opinion and they are entitled to them.
good,"Training lasted 9 weeks and was an excellent experience and exceptionally fun. The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers when a certain issue went unresolved. The dress code is laid back and casual."
good,HR depart is a joke... they rely on gossip not facts when investigating incidents
good,hours very flexible and a break every 2 hours and nice lunch area with computers and fridges.
good,"A typical day at Minacs required me to be, friendly, kind, and curious. I spent most of my day explaining how the on- star system works and sending directions to vehicles. During my time at Minacs I learned how to run diagnose checks on GM vehicles, computer skills, communication skills, and I learned how to worked at a fast pace. My co- workers and I maintained a courtesy and friendly work environment. The hardest part about working at Minacs was adjusting to the rules in different cities. The most enjoyable part of the job was the countless of conversations I held with people from all over the world. I also enjoyed getting a sneak peak of the new GM vehicles."
good,At Convergys the job was not that bad I enjoyed answering the phones and helping customers with their problems. The hardest part of the job was meeting the expectations set by the employer. To me I feel it is unfair when it came to certain things. With most expectations to meet it did not fall solely on you sometimes management was required and you had to wait (which would cause your score/rate to go low and you would get in trouble). I wouldn't really recommend this job to anyone.
good,Working was fun and very cool experience. This is definitely a great way to gain experience and learn the ropes. The people are kind and willing to help you and teach you the job.
good,"My very first job to start with ..dealing with all U S based customers with a process called microsoft ...solving their queries related to microsoft office which included troubleshooting..management always kept us on our toes....they made sure that professionalism came first...i worked at night .so was a bit challenging ...coming to the co-workers ,They were very helpful specially the seniors who made sure that we learnt ...hard work was appreciated and we were rewarded for showing results  ,,,"
good,"This is a strenuous job, but hard work does pay off if you are never late. You can advance to management in 6 mths"
good,"First thing in the morning, we get straight to work! All the team leaders there were absolutely amazing, there is always someone there to help when we needed it. My co-workers were really experienced and they always helped us out. The hardest part of the job was the first phone call of the morning. It always set the mood for that day."
good,"great management, Great Health benefits, co workers alwaus helpful"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Typically everyone begins at a different time each day, like for instance I liked to work from 10am or 12pm to either 8:30pm or 9pm, and some days I would stay till 11:30pm.  I learned all that I could about the system that if I were ever to be rehired I would fit right in with the system.  I enjoyed most of the upper management for the most part all of them kept me with a smile on my face.  I enjoyed working with everyone in the company with whom I knew, I developed some great friendships out of it as well.  The hardest part of the job is the training as you must be on toes the entire time waiting for that special moment or be able to excel at what you do best.  I most enjoyed the friendships I got from working here to that of all the thousands of people I talked to on the phones my first year on the job. "
good,It would have been a great job if I had been trained longer on the computer programs.
good,Working at Convergys was enjoyable if you can get past all the foolishness that you will have to endure. I worked in the recruting department which wasnt bad at all. Dealing with other members within the organization is Convergys downfall. I loved working with my direct co-workers and I loved working with my manager. What I will take away from working at Convergys is the knowledge that I have gained.
good,"taking customer calls,soulving customers problems"
good,"Show up every day on time, and do what is asked of you, and you will receive a bonus for so doing. It is so simple. The training is extensive, so even if you have never seen a modem upclose and personal before, there is no reason to panic."
good,Its ok if u dont mind working in a job where multitasking is a rush. Especially when its call after call you could barely writhe down the notes and track your calls while trying to help the cx out.
good,"Great manager, great flexibility, great growth opportunities and lots of skill development.  President is a passionate visionary. Culturally focused. Would highly recommend to non-agents."
good,"This job made me feel like I wasn't smart enough to work there."
good,"A typical day at converrgys consist of taking calls from contracted phone company, adding and disconnecting phone lines, taking payments for customers"
good,Convergys is one of the better companies to build experience and gain experience for young striving adults .The benefits are great and the culture and individual acceptance is next to none.
good,productive and nice working place very much approchable all the team leaders and guards too nice station nice pantry and people too. nice working place
good,The job was easy and it was fast paced you don't really depend on how well you did on the cars and how many cars you took and how less of a break you took....
good,Working Environment is Good Management Level is on average there people are very helpful in nature over all good Company that i worked ..
good,"All together, a great place to work, if you can handle the MENTAL stress that comes with the job.  Great opportunity of making great money, if you apply yourself."
good,"With a great staff and excellent experience gained, it is with a heavy heart I explore other career options for myself. I have learned a lot of core skills regarding admin/secretarial work from my position in the company and have made great friends throughout my time at Convergys. An excellent location and a friendly atmosphere throughout the business."
good,"Working here is fun you work around funny people and they do a lot of fun things when it comes to holidays. There is a lot of fun contests to win for money, it is a loud environment, but you have to be a little tough when it comes to working in collections."
good,"I took phone calls for customers looking for a package, mail, certified mail. I learned how the postal mail system works and how mail is routed. Management was easy to work with and very knowledgeable. The hardest part of the job was when you had to write a report for investigation hoping that the customer receives the lost package that was or is of value. Love speaking with customers daily and helping them locate their missing items"
good,"I 'v join Convergys with great expectations and with most respect of the working environment."
good,the requirements are a little out of hand yet manageable. Im the person you call when your cell phone bill is too high or if you want to upgrade/buy a new phone.
good,"*a day would consist of logging into the phones and computer than helping consumers with there appliances and also make purchases."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"6-7 hours in front of a computer with only a 10 minute break. Answer inbound calls regarding Directv equipment & programming, giving support to resolve issues via phone. You learn the latest technology with satellite. "
good,"I found it really interesting because of the different people and personalities you meet just being over the phone and all they want is for someone to listen, but the managers there it was drama because they didnt want to talk to the customers to solve there problems, but then i just put in the customer noting accounts that manager refused to take supervisor call and they changed everything around. And it was about time they did there jobs besides sitting on the phone texting, chatting, and web surfing"
good,working for convergys was a great experience it taught me how to have great work ethic also waking up every morning going to work was worth while. my co- workers were like family we had a bound that couldnt be broken. they teached me the i didnt have a clue about when i first started alomst six years ago we still keep in touch after the business closed i developed alot of great relationships at that company and convergys will be missed dearly.
good,Work schedules were gr eat but training was very unorganized and i have payroll issues...(my check they kept mailing kept getting returned to their office until i quit then i received the check).
good,"Learnt how to be in a firm."
good,Competetive salary. The workplace is good and fun. Co workers are always there to help in case you encounter difficulties in the work or do not understand something. Managers or Superiors are always there to help you grow.
good,Compania en un call center transnacional y con muchos empleados
good,"Excellent for individuals just getting starting in their career, this job is a great learning experience for high school graduates. It teaches how to be able to work in a diverse environment."
good,"maintain discipline"
good,"Convergys is a adaptable workplace, the people and supervisors are very outgoing . The shift work was reasonable ,bendable, and also do able"
good,"I loved the actual job.  It was complicated on some calls, and other calls gave joy.  Learning intuit product was a plus, and daily basis we supplied technical support for intuit quickbooks."
good,I enjoyed working for Convergys though things were gone about the wrong way a lot of the time. The group was not given the right tools for the job in training and instead given very good knowledge but nothing to have to do with the actual job tasks.
good,I would say that's its a great place to determine your career in life .The job also have a lot to offer as far as moving in the right up in the workplace .For me it helped understand things I'm good and things I can improve in knowledge of the job
good,"Great people friendly stuff, friendly enviornment, can not say anything negative about the company, long hours tho rate of pay is good"
good,"Answered phones all day"
good,Very chill place to work the only thing i disnt like was that i had to make sales to stay there. It was different from what i was used to considering i was used to hard labor.
good,"It's a great place to work,but there is a lot of favoritism at this job. The coworkers that are the managers favorite are the ones that don't have to take calls and always get multiple breaks."
good,"Convergys's is a good start off job for college kids and/or retired adults. The pace is slow and its very easy to learn all the materials. However, once you've been there for a while things start to bother you such as the scheduling, the break, and the fact that after 5 pm you have absolutely NO CALLS, and your there till 10. A typical day at work involves a early shift, being full of calls all the way until your scheduled to get off. If you come in anytime after 12, you might as well say you have a long day ahead."
good,taking calls all day back to back discussing performance with manager and also helping who ever needs it in chat.
good,"I learned quality assurance, it was a good job to make some extra income for the summer! its very urban atmosphere to work at. The calls roll in back to back."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"This job is great for college students who want extra cash. Inbound calling, this job is ok for those who just need to get by."
good,"Just Keep Looking, Don't Waste Your Time Here. There is literally nothing else to say about this company. ESPECIALLY in Richmond VA..................."
good,Great company low benefits stressful schedule shifting the company doesn't have personal touch with it's employer quite big company but the emoloyees are not really getting benefits
good,It not a company you would not want to work if you want to advance your career. I did not enjoy working there because the environment. I will do my work and wait until I go home.
good,Good company. Good management (higher management) but need managers who know how to handle teams. Good business centre and friendly people who are hard working.
good,"I didn't like the inflexible hours and endless computer activities. I'm a hands-on person, so I wasn't learning or retaining anything. I was going in at 3:15 PM and leaving at 11:45 PM, my whole day was gone. I have other obligations that would go into neglect because of the house. I also didn't like the atmosphere. I'd rather work somewhere more fun and friendly than somewhere bitter and cold. The management didn't seem to care about their employees, may not be the case, but that's what it felt like to me. I only got along with a handful of my coworkers, the ones who were nice and would talk to anyone. Everything was hard about this job and I don't think anything was enjoyable about it."
good,"Everything is fast paced, you have to be able to catch on quick in order to move up in this company. There are periods when the job is slow."
good,The point system isn’t fair with the attendance. If you clock in late and work over it doesn’t make up for the time you clocked in late. You get a point
good,At the time I was laid off the company had lost a major contract and laid off all contractors so their employees would have work to do. It was a time when management could not find work for employees and certainly not contractors.
good,I really loved my job at Concentrix as a Tier 2 advisor for iOS and Mac. The management did need some help there. I decided the job was not for me anymore when they advised to me leave my mothers dying side or lose my job. It hit me the wrong way at the wrong time. I felt a little sympathy should have been given for someone who's parent was dying.
good,"Although they mention that you can advance, all new positions are temporary and they have no problem throwing you away when they are done with you. If you want to grow this is a place to go in, learn, and get out."
good,Convergys is an employer that is more concerned with the contracts than with the employees.  They do not take into consideration health issues and work/family balance. Forced overtime with no notice.
good,a typical day consist of taking calls for a variety of clients. they are very unorganized in training and do not have very good support for help desk or team leaders.
good,"When I first started working for this company, I was told I would not have sell anything over the phone. Within a year, I was told if I did not make offers or sales, I would lose my job. As a single mother it was very stressful not knowing if I would have a job from one month to another based solely on sales. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customer service portion of the job. I really enjoy helping people."
good,"n/a, dis organized , wouldnt go back, need better managmement"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,A typical day at work would be to interact with a lot of different people around the US...I learned that you should not judge or let someone having a bad day effect your personally
good,"No job security, no annual raises, don't care about your homelife"
good,I was not really impressed with the management at this particular job. 
good,"Training may be good or not, depending on who does it. Teamwork is non-existent and I was told not to show concern, but to fake concern for customer resolution."
good,I learned a lot working here and enjoyed being part of my team.
good,Since its such a big company they don't care about the people who work there. supervisors were flirting instead of teaching and improving the advisors.
good,"Not for me. I didn't like the hours, i always missed most of the day and was to tired to enjoy my weekends. I wouldn't say its a bad place to work, just a preference."
good,Working in Concentrix brought me an opportunity to perform several roles in operation. I have been promoted twice in three years. As a concentrix employee we will be moved out from the process and with out our knowledge. We will be converted as contract employee and make us move to different company to work and finally after contract end. We will be informed to quit the company forcefully.
good,"Converges is your typical Call Center, you're coworkers are the best part of the company. But any belief they are in for the customer is all company talk. They are out for profit. If you live outside the US, don't expect to move far in the company, they have an artificial ceiling for international employees unless you are willing to move to the US for minimal pay."
good,"A typical day at work would include clocking in, loading up my tools for taking notes and pulling customers accounts up. I would help customers with technical issue they were having with their security system and find a solution to the problem."
good,"A typical workday will be continuous calls dealing with customers who's internet, phone or tv services are not working."
good,"I have gained various skills: communication, customer service and ability to work in a team. The most enjoyable part of a job is learning new information and skills."
good,"Learned many important things about Top Customer Service, One Call Resolution, keeping customers happy. fun work place with a supportive team."
good,"Not much of a great work place. It seems like a good job when you initially get hired but once you go through training and realize exactly what you have to go through and deal with, it's overwhelming. Most of the managers seem like they NEVER want to help."
good,"schedule wasn't fixed"
good,"A typical day at work I would clock on to my system and immediately start answering phone calls from customers at a average of 100 calls a day, I learned how to assist customers in a timely matter but yet still make sure they received everything that they needed, management isn't handled that great but I do have some great coworkers. The hardest part of my job was not being able to assist the customers due to protocols but they most enjoyable part of my day was knowing I helped someone."
good,"Depending on the day of the week, the work shift could be hectic or extremely slow. Monday through Thursday was normally a fast paced workflow, sometimes with calls backed up and non-stop work for hours. Other days It could be little to do with thirty to forty-five minutes between calls. As far as management, there are few supervisors that are normally on hand and it does take quite a bit of time to get through any special requests or assistance with issues both work related and not. Any type of manager past your immediate supervisor has little to no contact with call representatives. I wouldn't say there was a difficult or hard part of the job, once you're trained, you get the basic idea of what you need to do and the rest you learn as you go. The most enjoyable part would have to be fixing an issue that a member/customer had and knowing you made their day or took a load off their shoulders. It really made me feel accomplished."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"I really liked working there, but there is hardly any breaks in between calls. Some employees are just plain hateful to be around and schedules take weeks to get changed. I enjoyed the break room the most."
good,lots of overtime poor management very fast paced workplace culture is very 'high schoolish' short lunches and lots of calls made a lot of life long friends.
good,The money was ok but the work and the hours are hard especially if you have small children. management was decent for the most part. you really don't get a lot of break time for all the hard work you do
good,"Good call centre starting position for work-at-home."
good,"A decent company ,however there is no room for advancement and the job can be stressful for such a low wage. I had a good experience with the manager s I was i]under but there is a shift bid and you switch teams every time so you have to keep learning new managers it can become tedious."
good,"No Promotion, i am a hard working individual who is looking towards a career advancement and unable to get so no appreciation and no rewards."
good,job was cool just treated unfair sometimes. place could be fun at times when there are contest but could be a bit noisy while on the phone with customers
good,New life and work experience at CVG.. good and good place to relax at CVG sleeping loung!!! BANAWA and SPRINT is the best and challenging Math (billing) acount experience..  TY CVG
good,"This company has been good to me, great people and great experience has been given to me. "
good,"ability to help others in need is always a pleasure for me and during the destruction of hurricane Katrina, the ability and need to be helpful was diligently implemented"
good,"I have been in a good company, with good people and good management. I had a lot of experiences that can help me to be more productive in my future job."
good,"great job for stress free environment, if you can tolerate management that is unable to assist with working with its agents to compensate shift hour requirements."
good,"Its a nice place to work if your goal oriented, you go in do your job and go home. Avoid the drama of upper management and other agents. Stay up to date on job training and you will go far."
good,Plenty of overtime. training was too short however. Management is a little unprofessional and can practice favoritism. They use your paid time off without your permission
good,this is a job for you! You do really get your hands dirty with this job. I am taking about the perspective you get with training......................
good,"I attended a 7-week training course to be better able to handle the complaints and issues that may arise during the customer's experience with the credit card side of Bank of America. My daily duties were to answer and handle as many customer's calls questions and concerns. As well as collect money as payment towards their accounts and offer them a product that may be more beneficial to the customer's needs. I also closed accounts as needed or requested by the customer. If credits/adjustments were deemed to be granted I did such actions to correct the files, I was also responsible for sending out statements in the event the customer had not yet received one and usually collecting payment on the account during that conversation."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,the  benefits will be given after being regular. work place kinda toxic and workmates and team leader are bad at handling his and/or agents and colleagues.
good,"A typical day with Convergys would be coming in signing into three different systems. Review any new incomplete accounts, resolve them, and prepare for inbound new account calls. Verify all demographic information list upon receipt of the call; update, input data. Navigate the new members through a verbal demonstration of features and benefits of the device. Sale mobile phone minutes to new account holders and post electronic payments for mobile phone minutes, send GPS  coordination to members vehicle in a timely manner."
good,"good environment, nice people but high attrition, low salaries and poor benefits, people there make the difference. Hardest part was to see my peers leaving the company for better opportunities."
good,all in all amazing peers to work with management can be all over the place but in general a fun and enjoyable place to work and gain experience in sales and customer service.
good,"Organisation is friendly and encouraging. Work is tough but it can be harnessed in a long run. Fun part is they have lot of games,DJ Nights, cricket tournaments etc."
good,"Good place to work if you are looking to short or long-term work. The hours are OK and they will work with a school schedule. Training is in-depth and thorough. Management is unorganized and often rude after training. Expectations and goals are high, there is nothing aloud at your desk, so, things can become boring when it's slow, but other than that, this is a pretty good place to work."
good,This is a good starter job for a student living at home or a job for someone is who is semi-retired and wants to supplement their  pension. There is a decent benefit package.  There are no raises other than the raise at 90 days or when the Provincial minimum wage is raised.  Long time employees stay at the same wage year after year. The metrics required to qualify for the performance bonus are for the most part unrealistic.  Difficult to live on the wage if you are single or supporting a family.
good,Simple things like checking a bill and helping a customer can turn into the hardest thing you have to wait more than 10 min for help and by the time you've received help your customer will be upset
good,"They offer incentives"
good,Convergys is a nice work place but management is not co-oprative at all. Overall I would say Convergys is not a good work place cause of management.
good,"a long day at work"
good,"•	Assisted AT&T with their DSL inquiries"
good,Typical Call Center Culture. Did Att United Health and Colinial Penn. 
good,I miss Convergys !!! It was so much fun to work with convergys
good,"A typical day at convergys would be to come in and get on the phones. You have 5 minutes to get up about 6 or 7 different systems before you get pinged by a TL or yelled at. You take calls for generally about 3 hrs then you take a 15 min break, take calls about 2 to 3 more hours than lunch and for a person working 8 hour shifts you get one for 15 min break. i learned that every person is out for themselves and does not care about anyone else for the most part. This company will not work with you if anything happens. Management is generally chosen while in training so they don't know as much as agents. The hardest part of the job is keeping to the standard of surveys over customer service at the highest that it can be, and generally stats. The most enjoyble is so customers are very enjoyable to talk to, and the people that you work with."
good,"Convergys was a great place to work, however immediate management was not very helpful"
good,"This was a very diverse enviorment, which I liked! They will train you for weeks at a time to be sure that you know the material before hitting the floor."
good,it was awesome working here but the manager was horrible. He would let things slide if the representatives were his friends but if we ever did a mistake he would shame us
good,This position its ok fine to understand the job in Canada. I like it because you help the customer to solve Thier problems by phone. I enjoying it I can refere others to work in concentrix.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Worked at Concentrix for a little less than a year. The job overall is great, there is 4 weeks of PAID training. Amazing support from managers/leaders. A misconception is that you're paid little for what you work. If you're looking for an ""easy"" job, they don't exist. I worked hard here and got paid for what I deserved. Take your job seriously and don't play around while working and you will easily excel."
good,"I worked just over 8 months. It was definitely a great place to work but, a lot of work still needs to be done with regards to the companies management structure. "
good,I got sent home early almost everyday because there were no calls coming in since they hired so many people. I didn't get my schedule I was told to get due to going to school. They didn't work well with me.
good,Well since I’ve been working for Convergys I’ve learned numerous amounts of different call types so that’s a good thing I now take outbound and inbound calls
good,"Convergys, now Concentrix, has great benefits and a decent wage. Unfortunately the shifts aren't always the best, and often times, the shift bids aren't done in the time they claim to be"
good,Convergys management needs strength and improvement with communication and consistency. The opportunity to advance is there however it’s about who you know and not what you know and what are your capabilities.
good,on a day to day it was very fast paced i really did enjoy my job and all the incentives but due to the internet provider in my area i lost my position as their connections were not stable enough for the calls.
good,"fraught with energy, both on the phones and on-site. It's a third-party Comcast-focused National call center helping out the North-East with Business services."
good,"Its great company for a single person who wants to make money. There is mandatory overtime sometime . And you have to have a car to this job, because your schedule may change during your shift so you may get off later than expected."
good,no input from management ; too many rules not enough pay. Hours are strenuous for some projects ; don't expect to have a day time school schedule. Not enough time off
good,"I love working here but you can not actually request days off in advance which is annoying when you have actual engagements, request go in 2 weeks in advance no more no less and you have to ask your supervisor to reach out to who ever handles it which is just them verifying which does nothing for you, and HR omg I sent in my payroll info and recieved a PAYCARD, I reached out to payroll and HR numeral times and no response. So yes very easy work at home job but no help on important things to you as an employee"
good,"Ths is the company where i got my career started so thanks to the company for providing me the chance. In this job so many good things and so many bad things were there that's all i can say, i won't go in details."
good,If the management gets a makeover for the better and start really being leaders and mentors to employees the company will succeed. It is still very new company with great potential to do great things with the right people working for them. Also a better starting wage and a chance for monthly incentives wouldn't hurt either.
good,Very flexible working hours. Poor training and management. Very stressful and inconsistent working conditions. Overly strict in some areas while too lax in others.
good,This is just a Clock in clock out kinda job. Very relaxed atmosphere. Lots of crazy gossip at this place for some reason. It was lots of fun at times.
good,"Great job especially if you need a job immediately. Decent pay, great environment very clean and safe, managers and supervisors are professional and do things according to company rules."
good,"Good company, but needs an improvement in handling people to not quit in their job. Salary is fair enough for me but it would be more fun if they will give more incentives."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,a typical day at the work place is  very fast paced. Phones start ringing at exactly 8am. This can be a little stressful if you are not prepared.Being in a call center can get very loud and you may not get to hear everything that the customer is saying and not all the time you want to have the customer repeat their self sometimes they might think that you are not listening but its just that it can get really loud in  a call center
good,If you are into sales this job would be very beneficial to you. It was a great place to work to earn a good living while going to school.  The atmosphere and the people were great.
good,"I was a contractor and didn't work there long enough be able to provide an accurate review."
good,"In this business one has to use their influencial skill set to be successful as there is a lot of hiring and often time one needs to be flexible to be able to get a win win to achieve the results one desires to be the best. "
good,"Working for this company was great for the first year, after that shifts in management and lack of performance ultimately the contract was lost. If the company paid more to their employees they would not have lost some of their best agents,"
good,"As all call centers work under pressure and we are only a number,"
good,the most enjoyable part of the job was everyone on the team tried to help each other. the system was very easy to learn and the training was extremely thorough.
good,"Mudar a gerencia,benefícios melhores,plano de carreira para pessoas realmente qualificadas,preservar ambiente de trabalho bom."
good,IT all depends on you ! and then agian the managers always have the favorites so just be aware. Never tell your business because in the end you will regret it ! do more work...worry less about friends
good,"local de trabalho bem situado"
good,"Only one word describes my experience within Minacs, and that word is HORRIBLE. Upper management was completely useless and if you weren't a favourite, then you were not included. Care more about business aspects than accommodating their employee's needs. Would rather see an employee go than make an honest effort to keep them."
good,"Good company.  Shut down with short notice. Answering phones for AT&T customers.  Taking payments, making payment plans, upgrading plans, etc."
good,I would never good back the reason is management is unstable. Most of the time they are lost and the trainers need more training.
good,Convergys was a great experience it taught me that call centers aren't for me. But the work and pay is good. Good Management.
good,The place is a mill. They have a training class every 3 months because agents can't balance work and life. They pay close to nothing
good,Convergys was a good family enviroment to be in we worked together as a team
good,I learned about new technology that connected me to other states and countries (via telephone). I loved the conference calls that could be done with the entire team and most were in different states.
good,"I have enjoyed my time at I like the team members. I enjoy the overall process of dispatch. I have learned much while here to trust my judgement. I have become more technical knowledgeable. I have learned I can still learn. "
good,"Training was great, taught me best methods for customer service, and best verbiage to relay to customers. Learned best De-escalation methods, Environment Sometimes was noisy, Shared Spaces/Desks, Not always the Cleanest Environment. Raises were cut off for 5 years, removed sick time as well"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Take inbound calls for products advertised on TV infomercials, and credit card applications. I learned about sales and customer service. Management was OK, co-workers were awesome."
good,No support by upper management.  There is no room for growth or pay.  Their motto is if you are tendered agent then it is time for you to go.
good,I am happy working in this company but something is that is distracting from the work and I have to work here in night shifts only so I want a day job for my future.
good,my job was basically giving custmers directions to there destinations.
good,the best part is the people at work i have learned alot there the hardest is the micro managing
good,"This is a great work from home job that was fun, busy, and allowed my to talk with people as well as assist them in purchasing a product that they needed and wanted."
good,This was a very fast paced call center that always had someone on the phone to ask you questons. It was a good place to work.
good,It was a good environment to work in but there was a high turnover rate. It appeared that a lot of the people that took the position were not committed to that type of sales and didn’t stay long. If the compensation was better I could see myself staying there.
good,I talk to customers all day at work. I've enhanced my multi-tasking skill-set. My managers are always available to help me. My co-workers are great at helping if I need it too! The hardest part of the job is repeating the same script all day. The most enjoyable part of the job is the consistent learning environment.
good,Enjoy talking to customers all around the world and helping them with cable and internet questions
good,"I like working being a customer service agent under United Airline. My workmates are nice and people are so friendly, however you will find bully people which I think is normal in a call center environment and you just have to use to it. After working there for a year, I experienced my things get stolen for 1 of the agent working there, but the management never had a sympathy with me but with the theif agent. I never get my things back and never show me the cctv, the HR hide from the police cause they are scared to be investigated. Until i get tired of investigating, then I just decided to stop looking for that agent. I could say that management has lack of empathy."
good,"Great place ,a little dysfunctional but okay pay and they work with you they are always making changes must be able to adapt . Overall a great place to work at"
good,"It's good company to work with , but salary is very very very low to live .. and holiday policy has to change..  Salary is very big consider .. only bachelor ll survive . And Holiday factor"
good,"The days go by quickly with the amount of work placed on you. Not to say that it's overly difficult and hard to accomplish, it's just that you tend to find yourself with a stack upon stack of tasks and then you're day is done. Like many bpos, this is the case and it's accustom to the call centre lifestyle."
good,Okay place to work if you like rude managers they pick who they want to be cool with pay is okay and they do try and help but rumors get spreaded about you and why you needed the help no Confidentiality
good,Better than other BPO. However almost the same and also work & life balance clashes. I wanted to stick to the company but the circumstances become worst.Moreover no job security.
good,"Uma das maiores no mercado de BPO, tem uma cultura excelente e é bem dinâmica e diversificada."
good,We have Only One IT Client and we have the project with that Clientfrom last 15 years and providing best service with 24X7 support and its a good company.
good,"Its a big high school, alot of drama between associates and managers team leads, u can work all the overtime u want wen they have it thats the only good thing the checks be good wen u work overtime"
good,"Training class was amazing, our training was enjoyable, played job related games and presentations. I was a retention specialist for Directv and would've liked to have worked in a different department"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"I have learned that, your work load will not match the number of hours allowed each week. High expectations that they want it all done in 40 hours weekly"
good,Good for start your career or if you want a secure job for your family. Is complicated progress but some positions are better paid at entry level than a manager. Bonus structure is awful.
good,Its okay and they handle you very well. they manage you and they treated you fairly. They give you some advice to perform your tasks. Everything is okay.
good,Concentrix  presented a culture of professionalism that I found beneficial. The company as concern for the employees  and three clients. The company strives to deliver services in am excellent manner.
good,"I answered inbound phone calls for internet, phone and cable service for Comcast/Xfinity as Convergy's was contracted to work with Comcast/Xfinity.  I provided customer support, trouble shooting and service to customers to help resolve issue the customers had experienced."
good,The work environment was very relaxed. I prefer a fast paced and steady job. The shift hours are fixed once you have completed training. The training was a very long process and most of the skills we learned did not help with the actual job
good,"Call centers aren't for everyone, but this place was well organized. The pay was good, a lot of the calls were easy to manage. Overall, good work environment."
good,Not a fun place to work maybe because of the seriousness of the job. Fun at work is very less as the work was very serious . Work place was good and new things to learn
good,I have worked in Concentrix India Private Limited. It was good working environment and I have learned professionalism over there. It was rotational shifts however I did enjoy it.....
good,"Ambiente laboral propicio, aprendí a manejar situaciones que requieren mantener la calma, trato con cualquier tipo de persona."
good,"Company didn't work well with ADA paperwork, had issues with legitimate health issues. Company was nice, but some management was not. If that was better, then company would be great to work for."
good,Good place to work for good money most of the people are really cool and honest and are willing to help. You move up fretty fast if you have the ability. Can be hard on you if you don't like sitting down for long periods of time. It is pretty easy work they give more than enough tools to succeed. Sometimes the system gives problems but that's expected.
good,A typical day was face paced and structured.  A great job (with multiple avenues to choose from) to begin your Customer Service career. Would highly recommend!
good,"Typical operations and support. was part of operations, its a typical place where you can expect to stick around and grow. Growth is restricted to where you are in the organization."
good,Overall a good company to work for but the people make all the amazing benefits that come with working in the company mean nothing in the long run. Can be quite draining and mentally degrading if not careful about how you carry out your day to day activities
good,"I can't speak to the whole of the company as i worked for the Paypal account they had in house alongside AT&T, Apple and a few others. "
good,"the turnover rate here is really high  as it is a very demaning and stressful job. It can be rewarding in the end if you really put your mind to it, and keep going even when it feels like to much"
good,"This was a strange employment for me.  One month I was employee of the month, the following I was let go.  Internal management was I think afraid of me."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"The rules and compensation changes frequently and you never know when a contract is going to end and if you will have a job. It also depends on what project you are on when it comes to the environment (even working from home). Previous projects have been very stressful and you clock out in tears, while others, like the one I'm currently on is enjoy able but I feel the goals at times are unattainable and we get in trouble and then we fear for our job security. BUT I LOVE WORKING FROM HOME AND OUT OF ALL HONESTY, THEY HAVE BEEN GREAT ON A PERSONAL LEVEL."
good,"Great call center, only drawback was management relocated to KS, and I'm in OR, not moving halfway across the country for the work.  It was a fun atmosphere.  All the people there were happy, which is in contrast to some of the places I've ended up in.  Pay rate is about the same as most call centers.  They could have used the lower parking lot when they had all of us showing up, but instead they had us run all the way around the building to the front door.  There is a back door they could've opened which would've been great, which is why I gave 4 out of 5 stars."
good,Great place to work for flexibility. had my own business and was able to balance both work and the business.  Great Flexibilty..  But pay was low so that was the trade off.
good,Fast paced work environment.  Constant change in leadership.  LIttle work life balance if you are Director and above level.  Pay is fair.  Benefits are fair.  Culture needs improvement at the leadership levels.
good,"I do have a very good experience working in Convergys one, however, i also have the worst experience with them. I found great friends, I learned alot and most importantly I felt that I was able to grow there BUT my hopes were down because they don't know how to value their employees"
good,The job was pretty laid back. You are able to ask for help when needed. The training process was awesome I really learned a lot. If you are going to work part time just make sure to note they will be part time hours unless they need you to work overtime.
good,The company has closed this plant.  It was really hard to see the place dwindle down and eventually end.  I really liked the people I worked with and miss them.
good,"I liked working for this company and the people I worked with."
good,"Un buen ambiente de trabajo y buenas relaciones con los compañeros de trabajo, muy rutinario."
good,"I don't know very much about the company. I worked from home as a call center rep. I was very happy with the job. They have excellent training program before you start, and you are paid for training."
good,There are lots of people that use this as a stepping stone to move on to a different company. You can also choose to stay and grow to higher roles if you want.
good,if you do not know of apple products or can grasp the tech training then you are in a lot of trouble. they do not assist with further training and are real strict. they have you on a time limit to help certain amount of customers not caring to remember that not all customers are the same in their learning process.  if you have a doctor paper or not they include that as an absence . and it is held against you. and your rating goes according to your customer survey on you and is ridiculous. if the TL's dont get their bonus you are made well aware that you need to do better so they do better
good,"Convergys offers its employees promises for a bright developing career and enough salaries to put up for the compensations."
good,"I worked for the siriusxm U.S. contract for a year and a few months. great job, great co workers and managers. Really flexible and understanding to work with your schedule and needs. Great benefits, and competitive bonus."
good,"The only problem I personally have with this company is mass hiring. I feel the company leads you to think its a basic level accounting job, and more software oriented. Concentrix did provide the best supervisor I have ever had on a job."
good,"The overall environment is not bad, but it is poisoned by the leadership.  Most in charge have no business acumen or personal relationship skills.  It creates a frustrating environment when your Senior leadership is blatantly telling you that they are looking for  employees to fire to save the company money. I understand the company is a business, but that does not build loyalty. There is hope for the company and some extremely good people who work there, but unfortunately the majority of the people who will get paid more than you will dissuade you from perusing a career at that company."
good,"Good place to work at however there is a reason to thing about job stability as we experienced our being pulled out of my current work location. Apart from that there was a lot to learn, a lot of trainings were provided."
good,"When dealing with a client from a 3rd party company, it can be hard to tell when something is the way it is because of your company or because of the Client you work for. That being said Comcast is a garbage company and needs to be closed from the top down. Convergys is pretty good and the management for the most part will work with you on absences and ""points."" Also enjoyed that everyone was in a central chat and could ask each other questions to get real time answers for the customers."
good,"Loads of work pressure . As worked there as an escalation engineer , everyday I get new cases doesn't matter how many cases I have in my bin , whereas my manager can check that I have already lot of cases, suppose I have a case where I have to call customer at 9pm according Indian time zone but he still give me two more cases for the same time, which is pathetic."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,It was a good job they were bought out by another company and people got laid off.It was a long time ago so I don't know how things work now things could be better
good,I just think the hours or shifts offered are not family friendly. training seems rushed. Its hard to do your job when the information isnt provided and and have to use a third party engine search.
good,"Don't expect to be here for very long. If you don't quit, you will eventually be fired. And believe me, you don't have to be there very long to want to quit. "
good,"do not work here.  They waste employees time and management does not take the time to listen to employees.  Management vision is not parallel to what you have been trained on.  Management orders  you on your jobs duties with no coaching. Senior manager actually hung up on my because she ""did not have time for my questions."""
good,"I had a great experience working at convergys, the training sessions were really enriching, the management was talent nurturing, However the  employer and employee relations area was a bit rigid. Poor human resource function. Overall experience was satisfactory."
good,the experience was good but there is bullying of some sort on the floor. the other operations managers are like robots. avoid time warner account. ahr
good,Working at Convergys was a equal experience for me.  The work it self was easy the workplace is not what I was looking for. I learned about retail accounts & tax software
good,"i have a great experience in `convergys. workmates are awesome. everything is great. salary is a little bit less, but everythings fine. nothing more to say. thankyou."
good,"The great management made this job much better, they offer you help when you need it but aren't very empathetic when it comes to difficult customers. Don't always recognize your strengths but always mention any weakness you may have but they do try to help you get better at your job."
good,"working at convergys was great . i miss it. the pay was good, it was a mellow job. i just didnt like to sit for 8+ hours. i did enough of sitting high school. needed a ob that allowed me to walk around and still do my job. i loved helping people do the most simple things"
good,"Day at work Is always the same, i learned that everything is hard at the beginning. The management is good , the work place is not that alluring, the hardest part of the job is to reverse how you used to sleep. The most enjoyable part of the job was the feeling of you gave your best to help a customer ease their difficulties and give them the best you got to help them."
good,they not very good with scheduling. they are very strict with missing work days and are not very flexible with emergencies. they do have a good training schedule and decent pay.
good,"Work start at 9 am in the morning ,and end at 7 p.m in evening . i have learned how to achieve the goals and be optimistic ,how to effectively handle every situation ."
good,Not so typical but there is no issues regarding leaves. work culture is good. management is not so much healthy. no hardest part. weekend off
good,"Everyone was really sweet, and friendly. Management was understanding, and nice. I enjoyed working there, and I would consider working there again in the future."
good,The will always provide you with work and overtime. OK place to work but sit for long hours which makes for a long day. Great employment if you need all the hours you can get.
good,"Too hecticand no work life balance.good culture."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"good management and transport, learned a lot with manager and team member workplace and the culture was good the hardest part of the job was the job security and incentives and the hr policies which was pathetic the most enjoyable part of my job was when i was given best csr for the month"
good,"Ok company to work with."
good,Fun just pay issues late deductions they dont give a headsup that ull be deducted on some fees . Schedulea are fine but the surveyz base score card are not so agentbfriendly..coz cx are open to do theor opinion.even if its a good call if cx ratedvublow that still affect ur score cards.
good,I really enjoyed everyone at convergys from the hiring on to the training it was very easy to catch onto all the programs. fun place to work would work the same job again.
good,"Receiving different complaint and inquiry from different customer everyday, heavy load with a lot of notation with the account and personal reference for future dispute, Co workers are friendly and easy to work with and help you survive the day."
good,"If you are looking for high salary then the company can sustain your financial need. The disadvantage working here, most of the shift are night and midnight shift. You will also search for your own station on the start of your shift and after your break because there are no permanent station for the employees."
good,"It's a easy going job and but work hours are odd , magement is good and most enjoyable part is making  upset customers happy and helping them to resolve their issues."
good,Nothing really changes in a call center environment other than polices every now and then. The department in which I am hired for is lacking in the incentives area. Bonuses actually being added to this department other than overtime would be nice.
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, solamente requiere de un mejoramiento es su estructura y comunicación entre empleados."
good,"This is a horrible location. I won't say that the company is bad, but the Valdosta location is horrible. All of the managers are dating each other, and employees. It is just not professional."
good,A typical day was taking calls and helping customers find the best credit card for them and direct calls to the correct department.  I learned a lot about customer care and active listening.  Management was easy to work with.  Co-workers are one in a million there!  The hardest part of the job was keep your status over 50%.  The most enjoyable part of the job was all the amazing people I spoke with over the phone.
good,"Was a long journey working here, started from a client support to a trainer, achieved alot through hardwork and was supported by the wonderful management in every account I worked."
good,"-the company is really large and can be a life saving career but you must love the job, people, culture of this industry since they have good pay"
good,Great company. A lot of opportunities to move up and around the company. Management needs to improve with leadership skills and caring for their employees. pleasant work environment
good,"I learned new skills while I work here, and did advance once.  But its a stressful place to work, and i felt that the rating requirements were unrealistic."
good,"My typical day of work is answering customers issues mainly in english sometime in spanish. Be able to work along with coworkers to improve efficiency/ Worked on customers insurance issues, and took supervisor calls for other peers/ I know all of the material here; and want a higher role than what I currently have."
good,"They are a awesome to company to work with, sadly the product line that I was in no longer was a option for the company to keep the the employees on that line. They had to let us go, but they did work with us to ensure that we had a job before the layoff was going to happen"
good,Its a fun place to work at and with some supportive management. They helped me in improving my skills not only over the phone but with the real world as well.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,When I first started working at Convergys it was fun and I loved to go to work. I worked for the company for 4 1/2 years. I was moved up to a Transition Consultant after being with the company for 3 months. I enjoyed coaching and developing agents. Its always ways to make extra money with all the incentives they offer.
good,"fast paced,"
good,"Good job, a lot of dead time. Best to stay to yourself at this job. A lot of events. pretty fun. Hardest part of job is not getting help when you need it"
good,a extremely hard job because you have to get rude customers to keep a service they don't even use and if you don't hit a certain amount each month then you are at risk of being fired from your position
good,"Assisting AT&T U-Verse members with their Phone, T.V, and high speed internet services. Dispatch a technician if further assistance is required."
good,"Work is good at Convergys, but management is not that great. Co-workers were great and hardest part of the job was big gap between the Clients and the company IT, the requirements gathering was never success which puts the pressure on middleware and DBs as incorrect volumes per design."
good,This company is ok to work for. They have exclusive break rooms and massage chairs. They offer great benefits and pay. You have to rank high to get the best schedule.
good,"My experience in my former company is full of memorable experience. As a newbie in a BPO company you will not able to celebrate common holidays with your family such as Christmas, New year, all soul's day etc. and it seemed sad. However, talking with different kind of person was quite exciting and it would widened your thoughts and ideas how people with other culture live."
good,"work day was nice"
good,"Management is good."
good,"Average call center job, can be stressful if you get the wrong person on the other end especially dealing with medical bills. Could work hard to get the shifts and hours you wanted."
good,The job was fun and enjoyable until the office was closed in Moore OK. we had to choose between leaving Convergys or going to work at home agents.. I choose to work at home. the job  stayed the same except I was now expected to deal with outside issues (like internet connectivity problems and back round noise).
good,A typical work day would start by taking call form customers looking to lower the bills are cancel there service. We have the ability to take the company up on over time and it's incentives.
good,"Excellent in-depth step-by-step (paid) training process to prepare for the first 'offical' day on the job. Laidback, relaxed work enviroment with simple to follow polices and procedures. Easy-going collegues and Managers eager to help others around them."
good,The agents on the production floor are GREAT!!! Convergys is a great place to interact with your co workers and learn from them.
good,Assisted with technical support and general customer service.
good,I enjoyed this job besides not being able to be excused from work for emergencies. I had a sick child that was in and out of the hospital and they were not excusing me not even with a doctors letter. they still gave me points. Also some of the supervisors would hang up on you when you are transferring a customer for better assistance or they will have you on hold 45 minutes then hang up leaving the customer with a bad customer service experience. We also had several system issues almost daily but overall it was ok. It' a job!
good,A typical day is sitting at home answering calls an helping customers. The managers were helpful when it was convenient for them. Both the co worker and management were kind and respectful.
good,Customer service and Technical skills are a must to serve the general public. working from home allows the freedom to create a comfortable atmosphere to serve our clients.
good,"great pay, walgreens is a very good program to work at. that is for the people who enjoy working at call centers."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"A typical day at Convergys consisted of back to back calls, assisting my customers and always making sure their issue/issues were resolved. I learned a lot working for Convergys, such as always talk to your customer as if they were your friend. My co-workers were amazing and I always enjoyed going into work and being part of the team!!! In all honesty, there really wasn't anything hard to this job. Talking to customers and taking care of their needs comes naturally to me."
good,"I've learned banking, Sales, and how to connect with the customers over the phone. It was a great experience and had a great time working there. The hardest part of the job was selling because if customer say no you have to push until they hang up. My co-workers were amazing to work with, I loved everyone I worked with, they were amazing. The management needed to manage better and care more about the employees and their jobs."
good,it couldve been better. the enviornment was unproffesional and the management was not all that great.
good,"We at Convergys worked inbound and outbound calls on a day to day bases we didn't know how many calls would come in or go out we took whatever came in, and also did our outbound calls. I like working in a team environment. I got along with everyone there. The hardest part of the job was the shift I was on 11.30 to 8 I missed being home with my family and going to school activities with my child, but they understood. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that I could help the other person on the other end of the phone and to resolve the issue they were having and making that person happy at the end of the call or get them the answer they needed in a timely manor."
good,customer service call center for various companies. troubleshooting hsi and phone services.
good,"Convergys is a good place to work at and start a career. For those who don't have any solid educational background or working experience this is perfect. When I first started I thought it was great, as I progressed I noticed that the scheduling was horrific. This is my one and only big complain. Scheduling is managed overseas and is not on site. As well as it is very difficult for any of the team leaders to change the schedules."
good,"I signed into my computer system at home when it was time for me to work.  I answered incoming calls for internet troubleshooting, bill payments, and helping customers change their plans when it was beneficial for them.  Also, schedule technicians to the residence when I couldn't fix the problem.  The position was a high stress and rewarding one.  Management were set up in a neat way and I had a few that I checked in with.  I meant co-workers throughout the US and in Canada.  Hardest part of the job was not fixing a customers problem and having to send out a technician to their residence.  I loved when a made some one happy and fixed issues for them."
good,"Convergys was a cellular phone contracted agency. It provides customer service via a call center. Opportunities are vast however the metrics given are very unattainable, given with little thought of the types of calls that were being received."
good,Assist agents with system issues as well handle supervosr escalation calls. I have learned different aspects of the job in advanced roles. I work closely with management with given information for additional training to agents on new systems updates and programs.  Work well with co-workers in friendly team oriented environment. The hardest part of my job is when some customers don't want to meet you half way to get the desired results they want. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to assist people and learning new things.
good,"Co-workers were amazing, management was professional. Loved speaking with new people every day.  Hardest part of the job was being on the phone 8 hours a day."
good,"The job is great, it can be fun and exciting. There are a lot of freedoms in the workplace. "
good,"Energetic, productive, employee oriented and had a pretty decent work environment. A typical day at work is answering 50-70 calls a day assisting customers with directions, answering account information and emergency calls. Management is very supportive. The enjoyable part of the job are my peers."
good,"Convergys was a good place to work. It was an easy job and had health benefits. Convergys did not have very good job security, in just the time i was there I watched as the management would periodically fire large amounts of employees including tenured/management employees. Furthermore even tho they state that you can move up quickly there they do not offer the position to anyone new even when you have great stats"
good,"A typical day would include answering inbound calls from customers, getting their basic information such as their name, zip code, phone number. Once the basic information was collected we would ask customer what was the model number of the product they were calling about and then asking the customer the issue they were having today."
good,"It was a fast paced environment, good employee involvement, great ways to keep employees happy"
good,Do not allow cell phones and breaks are random. Too busy and not enough workers. Too many responsibilities for one worker.  
good,"I wanted to experience corporate life and therfore i joined Aditya Birla Minacs. I was hired as an Associate for US Telecommunication process and after process ramped down , I took an internal movement to process ''Retrieval Masters Creditors Bureau''. The work environment seemed peaceful as I concentrated on my job rather than getting engaged in any other field of unwanted talks. THe initial stage it seemed difficult in traning program to learn the different methodologies of US credit bureau company.THe co-workers were quite interactive and at times bossy in terms of work load.The most enjoyable part of job was when manager came behind each employee and prompted ''collection''..collection'' in a naration which was his daily routine. All had a big laughter as he seemed quite"
good,`a typical work day consisted of preparing facility for opening and making sure guests had a memoriable experience while visiting or resturant.
good,"A typical day at work was assisting customers with satellite service, adding new receivers, upgrading programming, downgrading programming reviewing current discounts and programming offers. Activating new receivers and troubleshooting simple messages. I learned how to use satellite service, and the difference between cable and satellite. I also learned that there are many competitors fighting for business within every service. Team work was a big factor, because I often helped my team mates and they returned the favor. Management was a bit laid back, so there really was not a line to say what was the right or wrong way to do certain things. The hardest part of the job was not being able to help a customer, with what current specials we had or offering something to someone who really did not want anything else extra. The most enjoyable part was talking to customers and helping them find something that fit their needs, or budget. I love being able to assist someone with something they love and use regularly."
good,when i first started working there they cared about their employees but after you have worked there more then a year they no longer care about you
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"overall the company was ok, but ome of the rules and point system were just not fair. Ex going into the system and marking a person late for punching in at 10:00 and 42sec. COMPLETLY UNFAIR!!"
good,I learned more than I ever knew about the company while I was working there. I learned how to activate the product.
good,i work hard and was told that would be rewarded but all i see is the pluses that we did have like bonuses were all taken away so that extra work means nothing then im asked to do something extra with no pay advance of bonus sucks so many are leaving and if you make one mistake of some one does not like you your out of the door period
good,"In this job my main duties were to perform collections, and to also provide customer service for AT&T customers"
good,This job was ok it was just a lot to remember and things changed so much that mistakes were had not to make and management hated mistakes.
good,"Company is good .Had a great experience of work and how to deal with irate customers.Also got to know about international places and flights.How to deal with name correction and date "
good,"needs better management, or at least if you got a good team leader, you should be set, typical day is answering incoming phone calls, answer any questions or concern customer may have , troubleshoot device, access knowledge base, interactively listen to customers"
good,They played a lot of people of due to assignments being temporary. Dealing with customers is tough and you should be paid more for work. Managers were caring and gave a lot of insite
good,"Apesar de ser uma empresa que paga pouco e quase não tem benefícios, é um bom lugar de trabalhar."
good,"I have learnt a lot of new thing however in terms of payout they pay very less. Apart from this, there is a huge scope of learning new things everyday."
good,"This job was a great place to be at every day until management changed. Everything I was hired to do was changed and we where forced to do more work than was agreed to. We do the jobs as a manager and support but are not paid for it. the peers that work there are great, but the management is god awful. Agents end up doing the managers work for them."
good,"The local managers were great! The new managers that corporate brought in, did not know how to relate to the staff, and it caused a lot of resentment."
good,"Good place to work, good environment and systematic way of operation. Helps you learn and grow with the support of professional seniors and peers. Would definitely recommend."
good,"Decent company to work for but during my time they lost the contract for the company I was working for. This led to a gradual decrease in working hours, eventually shortened to 3 day weeks and loss of employment. Ultimately I took a direct job with the contracted company so my time with them did pay off. Great starter tech support position."
good,"The little sit down old school classic arcade games and a new pool table -"
good,"Hi Everyone,"
good,"The customers are very rude but you do have a handful that make your job easier, the managers are okay but they do care if you’re able to work or not you have to be open to any shifts due to it be 24/7. You get taught so much in 4 weeks but the ending test is 60 questions and very easy."
good,"Retail processes are the best to start your career in BPO"
good,"I worked at Concentrix for almost 4 years and would have still been there if weren't for downsizing."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Good Envirement and friendly coworker. Is was fun and good hours
good,It was a pleasure working at Concentrix that also help me in my career growth especially for interpersonal and communication skills. It was a good learning experience especially for a starter like me in this Company.
good,was able to help patients refill meds when needed and enrolled new patients to Humana on better plans depending on their tiers had great talks with consumers even they were lonely
good,"Concentrix was an interesting company to work for. Even though the salary wasn't the greatest in my opinion, it is a great way for young people to start their working life and learn new skills and make new friends."
good,"Its very exciting to reasearch in detail,solve problems of the existing clients,interact,process payments&check/approve documents and advising for upcoming promotions."
good,I got to have a live connection with the members provide direction as well as do sales call my position also allowed me to do live direction calls as well as set up accounts
good,"Typical call center environment. When I worked here, we were customer service for Sprint."
good,There are lot of benefits offered in this company but doesn't provide well compensation for their long time loyal employees. Newly hired employees have higher salary than trainers.
good,i loved working here they were the first company that gave me a real chance when i had no experience i have been here now for 2 years i am hoping that they get another contract so they dont have to get rid of us that like to work there and i feel like i have a real place to belong working there i know alot of people dont like it there but when you have a place that gives you a chance when no one else has then you end up staying for 2 years its because your happy with your work i like to help customers i like to figure out whats wrong with accounts and how to help the customer have the best and most long term resolution and thats what i get to do there i just cant say enough about the company i was really blessed to be able to have this job.....
good,"Was a great job for me.  Unfortunately the Teams suffer from lack of skilled management.  "
good,Was very good with keeping the department as a family and was able to advance careers but compensation was not enough to sustain some in there mid twenties bit good for a younger age .
good,Been in this company for almost 9 years.  Stayed this long for good salary that can provide the needs of my family. Leaving this company is a decision me and my family agreed since all my time is spent on my deliverables even on my rest day.
good,"Company should provide better health care benefits, shuttle services should be available especially during typhoons. We also would like  also to recomend the company to give out imcentives to loyal employees."
good,Was not a bad place to work and defintaley worth the pay. The people at the work place were not the best but and they have paid holidays which i love.
good,One of the most divers and dynamic company in the city.I learned how to handle different personality in and outside the workplace. The hardest part of the job though is the schedule which I manage to handle in the latter part.
good,"good pay"
good,I like working here and wish I was employed here before it changed to sales culture. I hear that it was really a great place then when it changed to sales a lot of the job and people you work with changed.
good,It’s a easy place to work but there is a lot of drama. Security doesn’t do much to prevent people from stealing or bringing in things they aren’t supposed to bring. Honestly the pharmacy tech training and exams should be done before you hit the floor because once you’re on the floor if you don’t pass you’re board certified pharmacy tech license then they will fire you.
good,"chill"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,This position consist of answering phones and assisting customers with parts needed for their vehicles. This position is very fast paced with a minimum of answering 100 calls per day. The hardest part is only having one day off a week and Sunday's are mandatory.
good,"You have the chance to meet different people from different backgrounds and cultures. They improved the relocating package, as they help you to find a place to stay if you come from abroad"
good,The experience with Convergys  was one that taught me about call centers the most. The overtime the quotas that were needed to be met the grind of it all. I really learned more here then any other position I have had. This job is not designed for people with kids and no help.
good,"It was an outsourcing company. My job was outsourced. I enjoyed my job until it ended.  I would work there again, given the opportunity. not too bad. I liked it there."
good,"the reason for this review is the job uncertainty that we all faced, as our process EE services was being shut with no where to go. We took like 800-900 in 7.30 hrs and then taegets were tough but the incentives were good."
good,"incoming calls on directv accounts, 20 calls in a days work, must meet metrics of convergys, hardest part of the job is getting customers to keep premiums, or activating new wireless accounts, most enjoyable part of the job is that everyone is hype and welcoming on you getting your bundles or new line activation or keeping the premiums."
good,"Conclusive encompass to acquire infinite knowledge of Windows Operating System, Microsoft Office and to develop your communications skills by interacting with end users via oral and written."
good,Bad management no extra money were provided for overtime even though we are forced to do otherwise overall it was good salery was always given on time so  i no issue with that over all its a good company
good,"Working here was fun. Employees are friendly. Pay grade was a bit "
good,The workload is as you would expect of a call center. The people are alright and the managers are sometimes helpful. There was some drama when i was there but i dont know if this common since there are so many people of different beliefs and attitudes towards stuff.
good,A typical day at work was usually an upset customer. You would always come across a loyal customer once in a while. Convergys has a special way to attract customers.
good,A typical day at convergy's was a group meeting where the team leader would go over with the whole group and individuals there achievements and none achievements of the prior day.
good,The work place was so friendly and we had fun working. I have given the opportunity to have my schedule flexible as long my job and task are done on time.
good,"Convergys gives good training and the managers are willing to help. It can be very stress full but the pay rate is fair for the work you do, they are concintious about following the rules"
good,"working here be prepared to work inconsistent shifts and have no time for your personal life. It's a great job if your looking to obtain something quickly...(apartment, car etc.) but it's def. not a job you would want to stay at.. because just as fast as you got hired you will get fired. Dress code is business causal. Time management is everything. Don't miss any days during training.  If so it will lead to  automatic termination. Show up to work on time.. this will also lead to quick termination if you're repeatedly late.  You do have to adhere to a average call handle time. try your best to stay within that time range and you'll be fine."
good,Work atmosphere is highly bad. As they pressure to work and even given less salary when compared to other multi national companies. And also no growth even if you work for 5 years.
good,Overall its a good experience.  There is not much to learn hence there is no career advancement for staff.  Tutition is limited and almost as good as NULL.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Lot of politics on the work place. No coordination between recruiters and Operations team. Must be employee centric rather than being client centric..
good,They will write you up for sneezing during a call. Super micro management . Training was long and the information did not help once your on the production
good,"Meeting timelines"
good,"One Concentrix.  That's our motto.  That's true of MOST departments but there is one that is cut throat, petty, and dramatic.  Benefits are good, HR is alright, and there is some room for growth and development, but no room to be a real person with any personal problems, especially in that one Tech support department.  Concentrix as a whole doesn't seem very ready to invest in their sites or employess, however, and seems to want to run management light, which means most managers are handling far more job duties than is healthy or productive."
good,"Good pay and benefits "
good,"customer service, learned more about products for home depot. management could improve. workplace was ok. enjoyable part of job was being a team player"
good,I love the job as I acquired the knowledge to technically troubleshoot computers and understand more about computer operations especially with the operating system.
good,"Convergys is an outsourcing company, most known for their work with AT&T. My position was an ""account manager"" with Penton Magazine. I sold advertising space for an aviation trade magazine."
good,a typical day at work  would  be  to give information to  members about their  account and take  payments. often times we get irate members but  most are  nice and  willing to  respect clients over the phone
good,"Well it was fun working except low salary and stressful work environment. The job was good , salary paid on time but growth opportunities were less.Helping people was great"
good,"Contact center environment dealing with lower paid entry employees, so poor work ethic typically. As Ops manager had to deal with High School like issues and lack of accountability. If you can get out of the contact center than a much more professional environment."
good,It was a nice place to work. I enjoyed working there I just wish there was more training and team leads were more helpful. Overall everyone there was friendly
good,nice place. great place to earn different products And how to come up with ways to sale products as well as learn more about them in order to be more effective in a sale.
good,"This is a job where you can make great money at. For the most part, they have unlimited overtime for the most part. It was hard to take off unless someone picked up your schedule."
good,Professional environment and people take owners of their work. Feedback provided on time and measures identified. A person is given room to work on their feedback.
good,"Roles and Responsibilities:"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"ok place but somehow unstable if client pulls out or threatens to.  need to work on work life balance of employees. should encourage leaves and make time for it instead of cancelling last minute. work is ok, management of employee leaves no."
good,Its really good to work with concentrix company...this was my first job where I learn my new thing.... IT's helps to improve my skills and how to work under pressure....
good,"Fun to work"
good,I like the job but really didn't like the late hours having a 4month old baby. I also like how they really appreciate their employees buy us food ALOT.
good,"The environment was laid back, but professional.  The management was approachable  and always willing to consider different ways to improve production."
good,"My day starts with taking inbound technical Support enterprise customer calls related to their environment. Once the period of time, I have gained tenure which helped me in troubleshooting the issues."
good,"I was a senior account supervisor in charge of maintaining and controlling credit card Apr’s and provided financial solutions for customers. "
good,"Convergys good place to work but not a good support system in place. Team Leads were not there in chat to help their team mates."
good,Great way to improve your customer service skills and meet new people. You can move up if you like good opptunites and great work environment to be in.
good,Management is not that great there is no professionalism between the management and the employees once I went to site leader to ask my hike amount no proper response at all
good,"Here work and fun goes hand in hand, in this way even though there is work pressure but mostly we do not feel the pressure because fun activities will also be included every once in a while. The management is good. The workplace environment is very good. There is no hard part I would say but whatever we are doing we should give 100%. I enjoyed and had fun when ever the festivals comes be it any religion, we all used to celebrate in office with so much fun and happiness."
good,"No comment, I cant tell more of such a thugs, environment I think is ok, but nature is involved with people who has vices though, which happened to be unhealthy for nonsmoker"
good,It is an okay place to work. Pay is low and so they mostly get first-time job seekers who have no idea how to actually work in an office atmosphere. Morale is low.
good,Convergys provides an environment for an easy to learn job. Every day is the same... no surprises or anything new thrown at you. Very consistent. The drawback to convergys was you are often assessed on your job by factors out of your control such as customer satisfaction with the brand and not you as an agent.
good,"convergys is a friendly environment."
good,Management dint work i havenothing to say no more.                                                                                      Its okay though but no pay increase no incentive no overtime pay nothing at all
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"what i learned is how to be professional, it excel my microsoft excel skills and because at first i thought that i knew everything in excel but when i got in there woah there is so many things that i wanted to do because of what i learn"
good,My first experience in the BPO industry. A bit challenging at times but the experience is all worth it. Learned from my team. Learned management. Learned leadership.
good,"Productive place and good environment enough reason why I stayed for more than a year, but low salary. Doing supervisory or managerial calls for escalations, collating and gave agents a coaching depends on their scores in metrics such as QA, First Call Resolution and Average Handling Time."
good,Difficult when the headquarters are back east and all of the decisions are made by someone across the country.  No responsibilities were given to those in the field.
good,"I worked for Nike and it was awesome! The job is very , very easy. "
good,"Working in a corporate gives you good experience in professional life, it helps to learn more about the market strategy and updates in the industry."
good,"you sit down all day, talk on the phone, work on others devices, its alright for the pay, long hours, always busy. environment is alright."
good,"The call volume was high especially in the Bilingual department, however it was very interesting to get customer calls from all over the world. Providing excellent customer care and hearing their positive feedback such as: ""yay, I like that"", ""that makes me very happy"", ""thank you so much for helping me fix my mess"" ...was very rewarding! Co-workers were always helpful, respectful, and fun to be with. Overall, a nice place to work at!"
good,"I love the people but the company that is contracting this site"
good,Worked with inbound calls for 14 day exchange or buyers remorse for cell phone devices. Explained polices and requirements for exchange.
good,"The people I worked with were great at Minacs.  Management not so much.  It was managed by a company who didn't care about their employees' welfare.  Didn't matter how long you worked there or how good at the job you were, you were disposable."
good,"Great place to grow in, incentives and great benefits. Great source of experience in technology and customer service."
good,"good place to work, with opportunity to mix with various culture as a company of multiple nationalities and languages, Co workers and managers are helpful and create a good team work spirit."
good,I enjoyed workin mg for Convergys because it was convenient for me because my children daycare was five mins away. But the only thing I didn't like about Convergys was the work Enviroment it was like a big high school. I would be distracted because of all the loud talking and arguing and sometimes fighting. But overall it was ok!
good,"good working atmoshphere but no increment.. frustated with night shifts, "
good,"the biggest challenge for convergys is management. A lot of pressure would come down from upper management which in turn would make our TLs pressure the rest of us. Now some of us could handle that and make sure our numbers met goal, but others headed towards the door. Not everyone was cut out for such an pass fail system they had in place."
good,"You do have to be able to catch on quickly to new concepts, as well as being able to accomplish multitasking between screens. There are lots of motivational perks that occur to encourage everyone to do their best."
good,"I worked for this company when they first opened up, and at first it was fine, I thought the Director and her husband were pretty nice people. They paid every week and i definitely loved that and they paid me cash every Friday. I hated that i was pretty much the only teacher most of the time especially starting off for a few months and i would have tons of children in all different age groups and it was a tad bit overwhelming, but, I love children so it made it through (lol) overall it was a pleasant experience I won't complain and they were decent people."
good,I was making some good experience being a bilingual agent with this company where I was dealing with French Canadian people over the phone and by email.  I had made a good 2 years and half of translating documents by responding to email in French Canadian while the answers were made in English
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Job is easy to do"
good,The office is good for working. They have good facilities and also the recreation for employees to unwind. The building is almost new and has a lot of coffee vending machine which is very useful for the employees as well.
good,"It was an OK place to work, pay was low and benefits expensive. No opportunity to excel or advance. The atmosphere in the center was always very good."
good,It's a nice company but he salary part was not up to the mark. My opinion towards the Indian BPO is nothing as they are having more experienced people than me but still they need to look after the executive expenses and their basic needs so the employees will be happy with their family and enjoy job.
good,"Currently I respond to customer emails and chats , we assist our customer in getting the assist they need . We work along with our dealerships to get these issues resolved."
good,co-workers are fun to be with and they'll treat you as a family. The hardest part of the job is you'll be given 2 sets of graveyard schedules in a week.
good,"As I have been with Convergys under Time Warner Cable account for 2 and a half months, I've noticed that some of the employee's are airheads because I've been assigned to a floor support who doesn't even know how to relate and understand his trainee. His so offensive with his words and doesn't even know how to properly apologize. And on my part it feels great that I won't be seeing him anymore."
good,good day. troubleshooting software by email. improved my English level. working under Kaspersky (anti-virus product). Hard to explain to the customer who can't understand English. Great team members.
good,I Worked as a Internet tech support agent typical day for me come in clock in my phone and computer as well access all my tools so when the customer calls in I am able to assist with any concerns.
good,"They have a friendly environment and keen about the mood of an employee specially before the shifts starts to have a better performance. "
good,"The work environment is superb, the company challenges us to be in our best all the time, team work is relevant to accomplished team goal, the hardest part of the job is to stay awake all night and the most enjoyable part of the job is that i learned new staff which is far from my original profession as a nurse. I learned a lot from training and most especially at the production floor."
good,"One of the largest MNCs to work."
good,"It's a great place to work and has a really good advancement scheme where you can potentially go from agent to team leader within a year. There are a lot of different personalities so you can always find someone to get along with and if you fall out there are another 500 people to speak to."
good,"Everyday you have to be competitive and in this firm time is diamond, every minute counts. Well for the management, you have to be flexible to them because in here the only thing that is permanent is change. Most of the people in this company wanted to go up so they will do ""whatever it takes"" for them to be recognized. "
good,"The Idea that this job is ending is very sad I enjoyed working at Concentrix if it was my choice I would stay. Even thinking about going to the office in Greenville, Sc."
good,A typical day at work is answering approximately 100 calls. I've learned to work around with different people with diverse personalities. The management is approachable as well as my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is that I have to deal with people properly whether i like them or not. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I have the opportunity to talk to different people every day! :)
good,A typical day at Convergys you would spend eight hours on the phone talking to customers about their DirecTV account. You would spend it trying to sell them more programs and new equipment. You have people calling in yelling at you because they didn't pay their bill and their service is off. You get two ten minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch if fulltime. Convergys is a place where a lot of young people work. You are constantly on the phone so you don't have much time to socialize.
good,"Good place to obtain experience with customer service with different companies. The hours were not flexible, but if there was no way around your personal schedule management would work with you to facilitate your schedule."
good,"Not what I thought it would be, but most of the people are nice. Make good relationships with people in your training class. Otherwise training is okay. Penalty system is kind of whack, but keeps most employees in line. PTO is available for some not all..."
good,it is good job for someone who needs just a lil income. you work from home no traveling expenses etc great people to work with
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Working at this job had its pros and cons. I did enjoy and learned alot from working at the call center. If your able to work around lots of people and able to deal with some nice and very angry customers I do agree that this will be a good job for you
good,"I had relocated to Charlotte and Convergys was the first company that hired me. I thought being a call center job that I would hate every minute of it, but I took it because I needed the money. Well to my surprise I ended up enjoying the job a lot. My coworkers were great, I ended up meeting some fantastic people who I'm still in contact with today. "
good,"Took customer service calls for DirecTV all day. Adjusted customers' bills and programming, customers call in to cancel programming and my job was to try and get them to keep the programming by reselling it. I learned how to handle angry customers on the phone, multi-task better, and a little patience. The management is lacking. There's hardly any structure either. It's frustrating when you have one simple problem that seems fairly easy to fix for management, but no one seems to want to help fix the problem. Hardly any management were on the same page with things. They'd all have different answers, and after a while they'd just blow you off. The co-workers were great. There were all different kinds of people which I loved! People could be themselves there with no ridicule. The hardest part of the job is a tie. The management got very frustrating after short time. The other thing is listening to customers gripe and be verbally abusive all day. Some days it seemed like all the calls people were yelling, cussing, or very unhappy. The most enjoyable part of the job was the money. I would get a bonus once a month for the incentive."
good,"The place is good to work until it comes time to need time off but are not looking to use vacation days.  I missed alot of work due to being in the hosptial but was treated teh same as someone who missed the same amount of work by just laying out.  You acrue vacation days at a nice rate, but the option to not use your vacation days isnt really there."
good,I have enjoyed my experience with Concentrix. I'm only leaving due to being Contractor with no long term future with the company.
good,"If you really need a job, go there.  If you can pass a background check, you're in.  The hours suck, the quotas are almost impossible to meet, but you get paid well. So if you can endure being yelled at all day for things that are so beyond your control, go for it.  Not for everyone, but the TL's are really nice, usually."
good,"My training start at 7 pm to 5 am but was changed occasionally. We start the day with a discussion and at 9 pm we start taking calls. I learned to appreciate call center jobs and the effort that each individual/ representative was giving for the company.Well, the management was fine but there are really practices that I do not personally agree. My co- workers were the best. The hardest part of the job is reading bills and explaining it to the customer. I enjoyed most about this job is the bonding with my co-trainees."
good,"I used this position as a stepping stone to gain some experience in customer service as soon as I left post-secondary school. As expected in any call center, there is high turnover. That being said, Minacs provides very good customer service training to their employees that is transferable to many other industries. The people who work there are very friendly and genuinely good people. Pay in the call centre positions is low, but requirements for the position are also low. The hours are 24/7 (including holidays) and you can be scheduled for any shift, which sucks, but this is explained to you when you are hired. All-in-all, this is a good company that I would definitely work for again (in a different capacity)."
good,I enjoyed my time at Convergys.  Very professional office feel and the call center was huge.  Always campaigns or incentives were offered to agents to make a bit more to their salary.
good,"Convergys is a chill job to have, not a lot of time to waste since you are always on the phone with a customer. Management wasn't the best, but they got the job done."
good,"On a normal day I go to work and try to have fun while doing my task s.I am a talkative person though I belong to a non voice acct I still try to make my work a little more exciting and fun by chatting with my co workers. I've been with the company for almost 3 years and with my stay I've learned a lot but as an individual of course I still want to improve.Regarding the management ( on our acct) I must say that they don't value the employees hardship that much that  caused attrition (leaving the company).Some are placed on other accounts. Still I am thankful with my company for I was trained in so many ways.I learned to adjust and to become more aggressive creative and bolder when it comes to work. What I enjoyed the most is my co workers we love each other's company and learned from one another.I can take a nap during breaks since we have a sleeping lounge that other companies do not have."
good,"The company is a good company to work for, but it is a tough business to be in. "
good,This is a good company to work for however they are very crucial when it comes down to the evaluation.
good,The typical day at work was i worked for 20hours constantly. and i learned that we need to finish off our work on daily basis so that management should not ask question for the same and our co-workers were very helpful in all the matters the hardest part of the job was to punchs at excat times the most enjoyable part of the job was we use to have dj on floor on festive seasons.
good,It was a good job and got everything paid. The work environment was a little harsh as far as them being flexible with your schedule. The management can be somewhat conniving at times and if they do not like they will sort and find ways to fire you. That is the only part I did not like about the job environment. You should not have to be fired based on someones personal opinion of you.
good,"Good place to work via other Call Centers in the area. They do alot of things within to year to motivate the staff, ex; contests for attendance, quality scores."
good,"I spent three years at Convergys and while there are good experiences and bad (as with any job), for the most part the attitude you bring to the job is the most important factor.  Yes, the customer interactions can sometimes be less than stellar but the people you work with are top notch and with some exceptions, management is as supportive as they can be while still doing their job."
good,"We had daily new troubleshoot way to solve computer problems or improve what we know about it. Not much relaxing time, profetional way to behave always because our costumers need to feel that on us."
good,It is ok but was hard for me when could not resolve connection issues to customers for working at home.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,This job was also seasonal. Management wasnt very good. There were workers that had been there for years and were still equal to my position. So no moving up really.

good,"When I worked at Convergys I was working in a new department so we were not getting many calls. I would sit at my desk and review product information while waiting to receive calls. Being at Convergys taught me a lot about building rapport with my customers and it involves quite a bit of team work. Management was okay at times. There were a quite of bit of young managers and there was also a lot of profanity used between them. My co-workers were great, the ones who had a little more experience were always willing to help out in the time of need. The hardest part about working at Convergys was the fact that we had to remember the product information for every little piece of equipment. I loved the job because I was able to work with a lot of individuals and assist them with their needs."
good,"I like this job, alot of Over Time available. I love that we could trade schedules or give away hours."

You have to stay calm and handle the calls within the protocol that is laid out for us. I have learn how important being an emergency dispatcher is to preserving the of those i need. The coworkers are very helpful, we all help each other to perform at a high level. The challenging part about the job is dealing with the calls that are life threatening and every moment matters, but the most enjoyable part of the job is helping those in need when they need it."
good,"Convergys is a highly rated and in great standing with their competitors. The job culture is usually upbeat and communicative."
good,"Call center for AT&T serviced customers over the phone, I enjoy talking to people so this was fairly easy to me. i had a lot of helpful co-workers and learned a lot about selling cellphone services and high speed internet. however it was project and was only for short term."
good,Answering phones all day and fixing the computer issues that the customer had was fun.  There really is never a dull moment. You never know what will be on the next call.  Since computers are always getting tweeked and improved it meant that i have to contantly improve and learn.  I love to learn and see how what i learned in used.
good,"Took calls regarding bank accounts and issues clients had with them. I learned a lot about how banks work. The management didn't have it together. My co-workers were awesome, and I enjoyed working with them. The hardest part of the job would be when I had to wait for a supervisor to get on the line to further assist the client. Sometimes they would take a very long time. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help people."

good,"A typical work day at Minacs is very busy. I have learned alot from working there far as dealing with irate customers, and western union transfers. Management was very horrible and didn't know how to talk to their employees with respect. The co-workers was very friendly and if anybody needed help we was their for one another. The hardest part of the job was the hours. The enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers out."
good,I worked from home so it saved me money for but you're held accountable for more technical things when working from home
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"es un buen lugar para trabajar en general, todo se hace bien dentro de la empresa."
good,Good transport facility. The company used to provide food also but they have stopped now. Salary is minimal and hikes are given in various intervals. They have a bonus policy also with a lot of restrictions
good,"I joined the company a year back as a Senior representative in TA process. So far learning aspect and knowledge aspect it is the best process to work with although the management and work culture is very timid and not highly encouraging. They set high hopes of the company with employee however fail to deliver it without being biased. All trying to save their job, it's all about the money."
good,You have to give company 9.5 hours a day but the good thing is there are 2 week offs that are rotational. The working environment is good and you make a lot of friend there and the pressure is moderate.
good,Overall Concentrix is a great company to work for. The family/life balance is better than most employers. The management is always willing to work with you on the schedule and if you need time off they are willing to help. The team leads will help you without making you feel stupid and they will encourage you.
good,"If you're just graduating from high school and need a job site that's laid back, then Concentrix is the place to work at. Their not as strict when it comes to dress code and the work environment is pretty chill. If you utilize the opportunities Concentrix offers, you will go far in life."

good,I work for concentrix for 9 months and I liked both departments I working in but then speed of incoming calls was just overwhelming and in the other department I was expected to do more then i was taught
good,"The apple program was fun and gave me a chance to get to know people all over the country. I miss this job very much, the only challenge is in the clarity of company policies, and a better method for breaking out employees for lunch and such."
good,been only working here for about 3 weeks. training was a breeze but actually being out on the floor taking calls can be overwhelming at first. in the break room they have games which is nice.
good,"Convergys was an amazing company to work for."
good,"It is a amazing experience in Concentrix from the beginning till now, work is good but management is not upto the mark. Improved Alot in terms of communication skills."
good,Convergys was a fast paced environment and challenging.  I loved the people I worked with and my manager was very caring and truly wanted to see you grow.
good,"typical day at work is fine and learned to deal with our call,based on experience management is not that good,workplace culture is nice but the hardest part is not knowing who should i follow.Most enjoyable part is having new friends and teammates"

good,"Een geweldig bedrijf om te werken,  internationaal karakter. "
good,I have learnd a lot in concentrix about bpo industry as it was my 1st bpo experience. Managers were very helpful although the salary was not ar per in comparison to other mnc in same field.
good,A good company to work as I was in Amazon.in process where in we used to attend number of calls to give the product review to the customers along side daily challanges
good,"i really enjoyed working there"

good,"Salary is low Management is worse and Crowd is even more worse "
good,"I loved working for concentrix. I wish I had never messed the opportunity up. It is great working from home and being able to hop right out of bed if needed. I had a newborn and at the time didn't feel like working was the best option for me and him so I left, but if I could get back in that would be a blessing. Great pay and great benefits."
good,"for freshers  is good but not good for future .no give benefits or learning is a proper bpo nothing else .no good salary an any one side transport."
good,Working environment was quite good.This is an MNC which deals in business processes for different companies with rotational shifts.So as said before the working environment was quite good.
good,All I remember the happiest day at work is during training for two months. I started working as a chat support with music in the production area. Lots of freebies and games during power hours.
good,Management and team building like no other company I worked in. great place to work2. Pay is abit low but really good place to learn. Good space to work. Not a small cramped office. Good Christmas party's. Management a great and understanding if you try your best for the company. And never disagree with the customer😉. And hit the targets. But always coaching available.
good,"Being able to work from home was a plus, but they were pretty unorganized. Big on attendance. If your not ready to take calls back to back this is not the job for you."
good,Good place to work in. Pressure free environment to work. Management is good. Anyone who is looking for his/her career then concentric is a good place to pursue with.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes!

good,"fun but stressful. constantly wanted the workers to pitch in services with every customer when it simply wasn’t possible. some customers were very upset and barley wanted to speak on the phone, let alone be offered a service from a company they weren’t happy with."
good,"On job training time and training part of job was soo useful "
good,"Presso Convergys ho trovato un ambiente di lavoro amichevole e adatto a tutti, stipendi arrivati sempre in orario e senza nessun problema."
good,"I actually loved my job at Concentrix.  You have to be VERY flexible on the hrs you can work because your whole schedule including days off change a lot. Try not to take an 11 hr shift schedule because that's what burnt me out. You will go through tons of TM's, all of which I liked. You need to be prepared to work week ends. They give you an occurrence even if you have flu so dont get sick lol. Overall a good place to work."
good,"Just like with any other job, managers play favorites. Pick on those they don't like, find an excuse to write up, etc. However, with all of that said, I wouldn't mind going back."
good,I would give the company an average rating. Some of the policies are challenging due to it being bought by other companies every few years.   The people working there are great.
good,"Worked at concentrix as technical executive for facilities JLL thru Randstad "
good,Working in concentrix has given me the opportunity to highlight my talent and developed my skill. It help me grow mentally and professionally. It was a very good experience working in concentrix.

good,"Nơi làm việc văn minh, trang thiết bị tốt. Hạn chế về phúc lợi cho nhân viên"
good,"You work&depending on the program, your guidlines, rules&such will change. You will not need any previous experience, anxiety or anything. You will be trained&you will gain experience along the way."
good,"High salary offered. "
good,"There is a high turnover rate for entry-level positions because many applicants are only interested in a short-term stay-over, but for those who like the work or are comforted by the job security, you will build fast friendships and come to rely on team mates at and outside of work. "
good,Management is good. Provides good training and focus on development. The only negative point is the salary. I’d go back to them if they offer above minimum wage.
good,"It is an excellent company to work for. It is not a job for everyone. The company provides benefits to work there, also a pension plan. There is opportunity to grow and advance within."
good,the Teams are highly motivated and it s not just called a Team. They are really good People trying to help each other.  There is also a lot of activity besides the work. Concentrix is also a good place to improve a language. People from a lot of different Nations work there.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"-Fun workplace"
good,"Concentrix has a lot of great opportunities to offer those who commit themselves. But if you do not seek opportunities, you will be left behind. Management cares about its workers but sometimes has to make difficult decisions that hurt the Work/Life balance."
good,Empresa estruturada e os líderes focam no desenvolvimento do profissional.
good,learnt many things from this organisation and is a success oriented plat form.Where the process knowledge is give and the product knowledge also. Management co operated to the employees.
good,Nice company . Good company to start your carrier .  Nice workplace . Growth oppertunities . Increments done timely . Nyc transportation . Fun loving envornment .
good,"Honestly I would say that I missed Concentrix. "
good,"Get paid well, benefits are great but it feels like high school there. No real help after leaving training. High tun over rate due to that. They try to make it fun however."
good,It was very chaotic and training was rushed but overall it was a pleasant environment. I think the metrics were kinda difficult to reach but the I enjoyed my fellow employees.
good,I have not worked here in 3 years. And when I was here it was convergys not concentrix. I can not possible review this company since the buy out happened.
good,Was bought out and then laid off when I was not in position to accept work from home. I loved my job and thought I had room for advancement before the buy out.
good,"My LOB doesn't have incentives that are reachable for the employees. For example the bonus is attached to your monthly goals and you can't get any bonus at all, because the monthly targets are not within reach."
good,"It's quite easy to get hired, and the training is paid. However, you will easily grow to dislike the sound of the telephone, during your first months."
good,Took many calls per day. Commission was good. The environment was very crowded. Lots of drama. It was like you were in high school. The trainers were amazing.
good,"-Answering customers concern via phone, email or chat."
good,"There are great advancement opportunities at Concentrix. As long as you are dedicated to succeeding and come to work you will be successful. This is not one of those work at home companies/jobs where you can come and go as you please. There is a strict attendance policy, it is very much like working in a brick and mortar, you just have the comfort of doing it from home."
good,Coworkers were nice and enthusiastic. The support of the account I was assigned to was okay. Would have loved to work longer if not for the shifting schedule most often than needed.
good,Working on a project as a Manager level or an Analyst/CSR level with the company the day to day business environment  is fast pace and friendly. There are several campaigns to choose  from to enhance your skills. You will create long lasting friendships with your co-workers due to the incredible people you work with daily.
good,"it is a multinational BPO company spread in many countries around the globe."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,This company helped me just start my call center resume it’s definitely a place to help you from scratch when just getting into customer service call centers
good,Don't like you have to  change your shift every 3 months and to keep the be shift you want you must at least one of the top 5 in the shift bid process.
good,The company has an excellent management team.  This is a very large Global Company but each center is able to make it feel like a small company.  Good ethics and values.
good,"If you love being on the phone and talking to new people everyday, then this is the job for you. Quick paced environment, very caring staff, and great pay."
good,A day can vary a lot.  It can be busy with back to back calls in one moment and slow in the next.  The dress code was pretty relaxed.  Policies are subject to change at any time.  The customers can become disrespectful at times but if can stay with a clear head normally would be able to resolve most issues.  It was good to have some incentives to receive extra money.  It does not matter how long at company will always have to compete for the schedule you would like which can be complicated based off of what was used to determine how ranked.
good,"Between high school and deciding my career path, this was a useful stepping stone for me to work a steady job and save up some money. The environment was very fun and my coworkers were even better."
good,"	Effectively manage large amounts of incoming calls"

good,ol they are good have a good environment and good space. People are great to have love the help that’s giving from the employees and higher up. They are living and do a great job
good,Worked 40 hours but was not given the option to have insurance or any benefits. Was very hard to get needed days off or even request leave on certain days.
good,"It was a good place to work however, compensation was not as competitive as other call centres"
good,"Il lavoro si svolge effettuando assistenza ai clienti Amazon, ma riguardo l'ambiente lavorativo è troppo rigido con molte regole che non fa rendere l'ambiente gratificante"
good,"Being with the company for 7 years, the environment is friendly. A lot of changes happen but we try our best to be visible about the changes and try to cascade to all employees"
good,"By my time at Concentrix, I was able to take care of myself and fully obtain my financial freedom. It was mainly a call center and the account I was in was quite stressing. There were a couple of issues with the management over there that always lead to favoritism. However, it was fun working there."
good,"I really enjoyed myself with this company however due to company/client changes being laid off is sad/hard. "
good,The environment in MDC100 is fun and productive. I learn a lot things in this company and they teach me how to manage a lot of things in a timely manner.
good,"Overall an good company to start your career. Management doesn't works for the welfare of its employees, they are mostly client oriented.Salary is good, no annual bonus."
good,"Resolver problemas o preguntas de clientes, tomar notas de los casos."
good,I enjoyed my time working here.  I had many opportunities for advancement nd promotion.  While I didn;t enjoy having sales goal I did enjoy the department culture and friendships I formed here.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,work life balance wasn't great with the managers breathing down your neck all the time.But the team was great and I did learn a thing or two despite the micro management
good,"This is the longest work that I had ever since I started working in a call center industry. I've had a good experience working with my colleagues. The good thing about the management is that they will not treat you as an agent but they will treat you as a friend or a family. The company is not too strict when it comes to speaking in English if your talking to your colleagues because they know that English is not our first language as long as you do your job well, they will give you the things that you need to improve more as long as you also give them the companies need its more on give and take.The most enjoyable part of my job is the get together of the team for us to be able to know the personalities of the person that we are working with."
good,enjoyed working technical support and helping customers. The 2 years at the job helped me grow and want to explore a higher position in technical support.
good,"Great place to start off your career in customer service, I do feel like the company will hire anyone just to meet a quota and that caused issues at the site i worked at but concentrix overall is a good company. The pay is also less than what other work from home companies pay."
good,The company offers paid training however it can get overwhelming for some. The job itself was straight-forwarded for me. The work environment was nice
good,They are not providing more benifits for the employees and not activities and lack of incentives ... And some resources aren't working..thats all i have to say
good,"Job was great. People were fantastic to work with."
good,"I have had many wonderful experiences at Concentrix from sales opportunities to great benefits to volunteer opportunities with plenty of room to grow and expand your career and branch new skills. The hardest part of the job would probably be assisting with customers complaints, you do have irate customers but that is normal in any job, and it is very rare that you'd get them often, and when you do they just want to be heard and treated with respect. Do that, and it is a great place to work and benefit from."
good,"Concentri is a service-based company."
good,the company accepts those under graduates or even in high school graduates as long as they have the skill applicable for the job openings to be offered.
good,"Working at Convergy's was quite the job. Not only was it something to look forward to every day, but it gave you the tools to continue learning during your every day responsibilities and duties."
good,"A typical day at work for me was to come in on time with a good attitude, get all my programs pulled up and together, check my call backs for the day (customers who's issues I couldn't resolve in a timely fashion) and call them back with a resolution or to further troubleshoot with them. "
good,"Customer Service for billing, general inquiries and upgrades to existing accounts for Directv. Processed payments. Performed account maintenance. Performed up-selling for Directv products and services."
good,"im großen und ganzen kann man sich nicht beschweren. Da die Firma in Duisburg sehr zentral am HBF sitzt (5 Minuten Gehweg) und ein sehr angenehmes Arbeitsklima mit sich bringt, nix dran auszusetzen gibt."
good,"The job is fine, not too strict, just be on time and do the work right and youre fine. Nice colleages."
good,"It is very focused on trying to have the most there for employees to relax during breaks, The hours are there for a person to get the most of the hours they could get."
good,Good working Environment. My coworker are helpful and assist you to learn the job easily. The management support and guide you always. They will also give opportunity to improve and be promoted.
good,"it has great benefit like medical and dental and working environment, company always has team building activities to better have relationship with other coworkers."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"The company has extensive training for the process I worked in and one can have great fun based on the trainer you are under but once you are on the floor its business, but it doesn't really suck. However, sometimes the supervisors are tough to work with and aren't really flexible."
good,"Good working place...no work pressure..."
good,I loved the management that I worked under it was a great job.  My coworkers were easy to get along with but the  30 minute lunch was not cared for.  I would recommend this job to others.
good,nice place to learn and work. ambient working environment. most enjoyable time that i spent out there. good managerial hierarchy and can enjoy in your day to day work
good,"I actually loved working here. I loved the managers everyone was actually really chill to work with, the one thing that bothered med is that concentrix the company doesn't pay anymore, and they won't unless you move up in the company. And even then it's only a few cents. That's the only issue that I had with the company. Oh and then god forbid you get get sat back down, because they will strip that pay raise from you - like really who does that."
good,Great Job learned many valuable lessons. The time spent at the company was a test of endurance and patience. This company was very hands on with their customers.
good,Gret company to work for ....I started call center here at convergys & it help alot with my work ethic...It open up doors for other opportunities...Thank you
good,You are assigned a schedule with assigned breaks. Policy and rules vary from team leader to employee. So its a guessing game as to what is followed and what isnt
good,It was a very fast paced facility that was unorganized and was never able to get a straight answer from management. There was no room for advancement and there was never a straight answers when a questions was asked.
good,"•	In ConcentrixI got trained to support Devices and network related concerns along with product ( Sprint Telecom) regarding plans and billing related concerns."
good,The company have a nice workibg environment. They also take good care of there employees. They are more focus on their employees healthcare which is good.
good,customers were difficult but the environment was great and you would ALWAYS have the support you needed from members that were walking around on the floor
good,"Constantly changing at any given moment your LIB may change,and I'm fine with change but there are a lot of things required from employees that does not reflect in pay grade"
good,Working here was pivotal to the rest of my career.  I gained so much amazing experience that has helped me to propel me to where I am today.  What i enjoyed most about working there was that I was able to meet a diverse group of people who enjoyed work and enjoyed sharing knowledge.
good,"Great company . Great service . "
good,Productive and fun. There is an annual celebration for the employees . The management is effective however the matrix is achievable . The environment is pleasant
good,Best job I ever had. I loved being a trainer for Convergys. a top notch call center. I would certainly work there again and would recommend them to anyone.
good,"supporting staff and team members, call flow back to back however that used to enhance the technical skills. games and extra activities have to be done at the workplace"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"I loved the atmosphere at this call center. From the trainer that I had to some of the employees that I worked with. My team lead was awesome, and looked after me when I had my car accident. I wished I wouldn't have had to walk away."
good,Everyday is a new challenge. Management is good. Colleagues are cool to work with. Work environment is great. Salary is acceptable but it is fixed. Well compensated
good,"I was not with the company long beause I relocated to Colorado. However, I enjoyed the project I worked on and found it to be rewarding. I would work for this firm again."
good,"Convergys offered unlimited overtime every single day with it being paid time in a half which was great. The only downfall is having time to take it, they are really difficult with taking time off."
good,Job was great people were rude. I didn’t like it there but before I could get out they got me out. I was really looking forward for a new change convergys was not it.
good,"I suffer from ongoing mental health issues and my manager was helpful in making me feel confident to go back to work. The company also got new hours sorted for me and keeping me within my own team when returning to uni however it took 3 weeks of complaining. "
good,"Challenging for some, as shifts start usually start at night, or during midnight. With my immediate supervisor, who helps her team improve, I was able to improve my communication skills, and talking with customers is made easier."
good,"Call center environment, take inbound calls and make sales.   No assigned seats.  Management wasn't that good because it was a lot of distractive side conversations during work time. I didn't always feel safe there. It was ok if you had friends to watch your seat but it was a live place."
good,It was hard work working at Convergys but i spoke with so many different people and solved so many problems so i learned alot working there and i would work here again
good,Workstations are comfortable. There is very good training. You are not left on your own until you are ready.  There are frequent reviews with compensation tied to each review.
good,I have been working here for 7 years and counting. It was a great learning. Friendly management and great workplace. I would thank for the support I received from everyone.
good,Good job to build character as a person. the pay isn't the best but if you perform a big fat commision cheque is bound to come your way which really makes it worth it.
good,"Concentrix has been a great place to gain experience for career growth. There are several opportunities initially to advance in your career but once you move up a level or 2 the advancement opportunities decrease tremendously."
good,"I began work at Convergys for the Sprint department during June of 2018. Working for Sprint as an Account Service Specialist, I receive incoming calls from customers who are experiencing trouble with their account; mainly concerns with billing. The role also consists of working with customers interested in cancelling their account; my goal is to assure the customer continues business with Sprint by offering discounts, credits, and understanding what their main concern is."
good,It was an easy job. Due to the excellent training you get. They give you all the skills you need to be successful.  The time seems to pass by while on the phones with our customers.
good,Met alot of different people. Most of us were several years out of high school but definitely has high school vibes. All supervisors were really nice to work with.
good,"It's a place where a lot is required of you. There are occasional fun activities too and little perks here and there."
good,I don’t have nothing to say but that it was a good part time job and I appreciate the opportunity and that I would recommend for somebody like you to work there if your still in school
good,"I enjoyed my almost four years with Convergys.  They provided good benefits.  I was able to adjust my schedule.  For someone wanting an At-Home job, I would recommend Convergys."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,able to develop people and communication skills. de-escalation and positive goal oriented communication. unfortunately the harder you work the more work you will be asked to do with no pay increase. little to no opportunity to move up on site.
good,Excellent company. Very innovative in their hiring process and training. Very good salaries for contract work. Management was easy going and accountable.
good,First job learnt to use applications and how to interact with people. Beautiful experience as was young and energetic. Met many friends and had good memories.
good,"Fixed schedule for 3 months at a time, on average. Schedule bids happen every 2 -3 months. No flexibility on this project with hours. Convergys has other projects which do allow a lot of flexibility with scheduling. The work is fairly easy but you must be comfortable with finding answers on your own using the provided resources. The incoming calls are usually constant. Some projects have little support from management. As a company, Convergys does try to engage employees, though, and takes employee feedback into consideration when changing policies."
good,"Overall it was a good experience working as a trainee in Concentrix. It is fun workplace, good colleagues and very competent working environment which is good for work experience."
good,"As long as you put in effort and do your job, you’ll be fine. There is a wide range of people and personalities. Can make work fun, but also can be drama. Just stay professional and you’ll be fine. "
good,"Running data to coach individual CSR. "
good,"Nice Place To Work People Are Very Supportive "
good,Constant schedule changes make it difficult to adjust your life schedule.  There is no continuity. Vendor changes effect our positions constantly. Otherwise a good place to work

good,Solved customer service issues over the phone and upgraded accounts through the computer system.  It was challenging sitting in the same sport for 8 hours per day.
good,The operation managenent doesn't seem to know how really handle their employee very well.working will be much happier if they really know how to handle their employees very well.
good,"I enjoyed working here as a team lead. I enjoyed helping customers resolve their concerns. The workplace culture was really non existent, you didn't interact with your coworkers often"
good,"Work experience with working at convergys was very laid back, but when it comes to getting the work done we was on top with meeting our sale mark and making sure our customer was happy with there service and bill."
good,"fast paced, use of multi line phones, you have to be patient. takes time to learn and you don't have much time. the pay was great. advancement was ok but there was not many opportunities. management was set up nontraditional."
good,It worked for the interim.  I needed to get back in the workforce and this is where I started. It was easy application process but then trying to get placed was stressful.
good,"It was an amazing journey with CNX, have learned lot of things which yield in personal and professional growth. Best place to start career and enhance skill."

good,"good place to work but callers are usually angry, I like my co workers and my supervisor. paid training and they pay well. Short lunch and short breaks"
good,"Its a good working pace"
good,"At convergys you were required to speak with the public--the good, bad, and down-right ugly. You had to be professional and courteous regardless of the caller. If you have a temper and don't know how to keep your cool, convergys is not for you."
good,"Overall rating good, well behaved and friendly colleagues, fun workplace. Salary structure is real bad and beginners take home a meager salary. The hardest part of the job was sticking to the breaks, two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute break."
good,"I have been to 2 CVG sites, first in cebu, in cebu it was my first ever job, it was a toxic account as they say if you survive sprint then you can survive any account. CVG cebu is great , I made a lot of friends, up until now we still have communication. My second CVG stint is CVG baguio, its a typical call center wherein you can only experience work life balance on the posters, politics is on the rise here, you cannot get your leave benefits and they require manda OT, not a good experience for me, if baguio only have other options aside CVG i will be the first to exit out."
good,"It was a great learning experience as Tech Support. Customers would call with the craziest complaints, and you were always expected to up sale to every caller."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Within the 1 year and  4 month experience I think Convergys offers a very promising career path. Though, since they are out sourcing there really is no assurance whether an account will last or not. The career elevation in this kind of company is very low since it all depends on the status of the outsourced client metrics. Hence, benefits and all I think the only thing they need to improve on will be HMO coverage. It is very unlikely for a company like convergys to avail of a very cheap HMO package for their employees, especially those on the primary level, since those people are the ones whose supposed to get more health coverage. They are the ones who represent the outsourced client overseas, the company should be taking care of them more by specific means. So hence, I hope the company will improve on this and think of their employees health more and also I hope that politics in within the company will be eliminated since it is not a good image to spread if someone asks ""how is it working with convergys?"" to be honest the first thing that may come in mind is politics everywhere. "
good,"A positive mission statement outlines the goals and demonstrative behavior that exemplify the highest commitment to quality and service to each other, the company, customers and shareholders. The company sets out to achieve its goals in ethical, honest ways with an elevated sense of purpose to improving the planet and humanity."
good,Good BPO company. Provides good benefits and a decent salary package. Facilities are decent. Management is okay. Good for first timers in the BPO industry.
good,fast paced for the most part and really fun most of the time. low stress if you do your job. it is  sales oriented  company. lots of free stuff and prizes.
good,Hoping to get started as a part time .. And excited to experience how the workaround of the company is being process.i want to enjoy some of my excess time to gain profit and to earn more for myself and for my family to be able to achieve athe goals i want in the future. And hoping to spend time also with my family and help them with their expenses.
good,"Convergyd gave me a platform to utilise and sharpen my skills, specially my communication and people managment skills improved a lot. It is always a wonderful feeling to be a part of this company."
good,"Good work culture, people management is good work flow management good canteen good workflow culture very nice environment to work within and a well addressable skilled people"

good,The managers and support specialists are very approachable. They also encourage employees to realize their full potential by providing regular coaching sessions.
good,"Muy buen ambiente de trabajo, compañeros agradables. Ubicación céntrica, café gratis, horarios flexibles."
good,"overall its a good company. management was supportive. only issue was getting leave, 1 week prior permission needed for taking leave that allotted for me. the job profile include  verification procedure, inventory management, customer client relationships."
good,"It was a fast paced inbound call center for a satellite TV company. I took calls to help customers upgrade theirs service, set appointment times for technicians to do service calls. The management was helpful and treated me like a human being not just another employee. The hardest part of the job was the time needed to type your report about each call before the next call came in was short and so it was difficult to make a full account of how the call went."
good,"Overall experience with the company was great. Been there for about 7 months, noting to complain and good company to worked with. It feels bad for be to have another career path but it's always a part of growing up."
good,"Being in charge of your task and competencies was fulfilling"
good,"Days are pretty regularly structured with quotas for certain activities. Lots of opportunity for modernization and leadership development. Its very difficult to communicate directly with clients concerning issues that arise with, or impact their subscribers due to the reporting structure."
good,Great place to work for someone that wants to work at home.  It is really hard to get day shift hours.  There can be no background noise when you are working.
good,"At this company, I was able to develop my multi-tasking skills to its full potential. You have to speak, type and think all at the same time, because you have metric targets to focus on, you have a customer to help and a note to make."
good,Great training ground to develop your skills and make a career. But work-life balance is a big challenge given the company culture of being always available to respond to and address business needs and client requirements. Huge focus is on profitability and performance.
good,"Good place to work, just need to pay better hourly wages and improve the bonus structure. Management could be improved, did not receive any coaching from my supervisor to help improve my skills."

good,"We would handle trouble and billing costs for an outside cable company, which switch hands twice while i was working there. Troubleshooting protocol and working hours were handled on the fly, making for a chaotic and confusing environment. In the end our divisions calls were all outsourced to the company's India location."
good,convergys is a great starting point not much room for advancement friendly dress code and work environment great group of people kept me coming to work
good,"First time that I will working in a call center industry, you need to adjust everything especially your time since you will be working in a graveyard shift but still I learned a lot."
good,"Working at client end gives freedom to work, Nothing new to learn and to move forward in career. The management is reactive to the business needs. Reasonably good employer though."
good,this was my first call center experience and it was quite different then other jobs that I had.  for a call center it was good for the type of company that we were working for DirecTV but when ATT took over it was a different story.
good,"When i worked at Convergys, it was mostly an AT and T call center. I was a customer service rep for a wireless company out of Cincinnati. There were many different people to work with."
good,"Calm work place with fun people. Poor management but they had prizes for advisers like gift cards, shirts, etc. Chat advisors work with customers on their technical problems with phones, etc. Statistics depend on random surveys sent to customers."

Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"good they make work fun for employees, incentives, work with family life.you always learn new things, cross trained... the only reason for leaving here would be pay"
good,Your everyday routine is the same. I found it unproductive because after your working hours you are going to sleep after after that prepare again for your duty.
good,Convergys is a great place to work. I learned a lot at Convergys. I moved up really fast. The hardest part of this job is having to manage so many different types of people.
good,"I live in Moncton, and Concentrix is in Riverview. I asked many times for a shift that would allow me to catch the last bus that would connect to Main Street buses. Concentrix tried but were unable to offer me a more suitable shift"
good,Good work place and employee are treated well but i could not get any personal growth from the job. Transportation provided is good. Salary and benefits are paid without any delay and problems.
good,"concentrix is well known company , if u want to make a career in bpo indurstry that is a platform , you can join nd bost of your career . coz i lernt a lot from this company."
good,"Concentrix An organization's culture consists of the values, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors that employees share and use on a daily basis in their work"
good,This business is no longer open. I am not sure if they closed due to poor management but they are no longer open for business. No one can be recommended to this job.
good,"The entire management and training team were very helpful, very professional and willing and able to answer any questions and assist in any platform needed. Overall it was a great learning experience that helped me to grow in the field."
good,New company it canbe a great company just still at the early stage. Once it gets the jinks out it would be a great company too work for. It had maggot problem with payroll but i think they got that fixed
good,"A typical day at work involved me dealing with a various amount of customers and their medications they were taking. I was responsible for inputting the medication they were taking into the system, providing them pricing information and then setting them up for a medication mail delivery service if they were interested. I learned a lot about the United States health care programs and the types of coverage that were offered through medicare. "
good,"Typical time at work is working in the nights."
good,"Working at Convergys you have to have tough skin. the environment its self is full of poorly educated people. The lack of professionalism in this call center is indescribable. You truly have to be there to understand, better yet go for an interview, sit in the lobby and watch the caliber of people that walk through the doors. Management will tell you your absence is excused and will not fix your points. I was a trainer for Convergys and i have seen the cars of my peers be vandalized by agents that were upset with them. "
good,Good Payer but the management needs improvement on how they handle their employees. They always plot Mandatory Over time without letting the agent know about it and without any sign off or agreement.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,buena empresa pero falta de posibilidades de crecimiento
good,"Enjoyed my job at Convergys while I had it. Walked in to work and got straight on the phones. Receiving calls from AT&T customers about their bills, problems with phone, and other things."
good,I would love to work there again if they get good sales process and create opportunity to earn incentives. We are working for money and if its not meeting your basic needs then we should try something else.
good,Things change alot daily depending on the needs of the client. Great incentives for good performance. Good attendance policy and willing to work with you for time off.
good,Easy to get access to needed information. Recruiting process was seamless. The recruiters kept in contact to make sure the employee and employer were satisfied
good,"Convergys has many different jobs within in its company. This was my first call center type of job. It was something that i had to get use too, coming form a retail sales position. I liked the people I worked with and I didn't mind the work either. I was collecting on past due balances for a lawn care service. I had clients who were friendly and then I had clients who were not so friendly. You just have to be tough when working in collections."
good,it can be very stressful at times. you have to meet certain goals or else your constantly watched until they can find a reason to get rid of you. in my experience i didnt have this problem because i was decent at my job. the issue i had was the adults who worked there who had more issues then high schoolers. and when some thing was said about it to management they didnt care.
good,Concentrix Technologies is a good company. Great for freshers to have both BPO and Enterprise level product support job exposure. A great place to learn and apply your Technical skills.
good,This job needed to provide more training and compensation for what they asked of you. They did not offer discounts on the cable packages to it's employees and that seemed cheap. I did not get benefits so I am not sure of what they offered before I left. I would try again if offered more pay and more training.
good,"This was my first job and my first company, I learned a lot from this company as this was my first experience in the BPO industry. The account was not that hard so it was a good starting point for me."
good,"I improoved my communication skills nd my thinking,my punchuality, my sincerity nd much more so i can handle any customers my confidence level improoved."
good,If you can show up and take calls all day long then it wont be a bad job for the pay. It gets very tedious very quickly so if you need variety this isnt for you.
good,Working in this company is very challenging yet full of fun and excitement. I was trained to work in a fast changing environment. It taught me professionalism and efficient customer service specialist.
good,The management carries the company on their back. Without them the work wouldn't be worth it. It's a great place to work if you need to get back on your feet.
good,"Working in customer service line of business is an involuntary alertness for 24/7 especially if the work is a night shift job. It is fun environment to work in which has intolerable productivity, improving, learning, flexibility and much more that varies in customer service business though one thing that is unavoidable in this job is the lackness of health conciousness especially on night shift which causes unexpected changes in daily life. It is simply a never ending process till the employee takes control in life!"
good,"Nicole brown is a failing TL who likes to find little things to nit pick on just to keep the heat off of herself because she sucks at her job. She will get you fired for the smallest things , especially if you seem to be doing better than she. Overall the company is a great place to work.. unless you get her as a team lead at the Farmington hills location."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes!

good,The management team goes above and beyond make for a great/fun working environment. They are very helpful/knowledgeable of the job and & always will to help.
good,I wasn't interested in staying. Call center environment was pretty cool and relaxing. I just couldn't handle being on the phones and the calls are non stop.
good,"Everyone who I interacted with during my stay in the company were generally pleasant and warm. I have gained true friends, the real ones, who served as one of my motivations in staying for 5 years."
good,All in all i would recommend every fresher who hopes to have a good future in the BPO sector and wants a work place with job security and plenty of growth opportunity.
good,"Call center inbound calling, company provides recognition for employees that have a satisfied client. Company has mandatory overtime for employees. Company provides encentives."
good,"This was a massive call center with too much going on, the quality control staff were too critical and the constant feedback was a bit annoying. They would occasionally have good sales spiffs."
good,The organisation is a valuable name to start your career with. The environment is good enough and employees are provided ample chances to progress in their career.
good,"My typical working day in Xbox was to check my cases ( around 100 In my queue everyday)"
good,"Management is hard to work with, they are overwhelmed with too many agents and don't have enough time in a day to coach all of them. "
good,"concentrix was a fine place towork for. The pay was ok, they taight us everything we needed to know to perform our job duties, Rules changed all of the time."
good,i love working at convergys but i was resigned due to a long travel from Lapu-Lapu to Cebu City and i was hired from The Results Companies which is related from my work at convergys.
good,Its good company to work and to expand our knowledge. We will get end to end opportunity in this company. We will get all kind of facility and service specially for women employee.
good,The company is brilliant.. very good to start off with and the work ethics are good..  they guide u in the way you will excel and good growth and self development
good,Fun place to work with. It has a very supportive group of individuals (Associates and Management) with a friendly working environment and a sense of positivism.
good,Overall a gud place to start ur career after your under graduation.Long working hours it was a voice process shifts were not convenient.No recognition for your work
good,"Considering the benefits and salary are all good but work life balance is being compromised. Though I was able to acquire a lot of skills, technical support / customer service and retention."
good,"They should be working more skilled people rather than befriending them. "
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes!

good,"This job was pretty easy as long as you follow protocol."
good,Convergys is a good place to work. They are relaxed and help as much as they can. The pay is really good. They try to work with your schedule as much as possible.
good,Everyone in the company was committed to maintain and improve the stats of every team. They do whatever it takes to stay in the first spot on overall rankings against other sites of the company.
good,I loved the culture that they have where it seems like the people in the company seem to know almost everyone because of the closeness with each other.
good,"I was working under google process  so it was very helpful in my overall development. It had a good work environment . With free food , beverages . Secure and best cab facilities."
good,"The work place is too awesome over their and the people and the managers too cooperative and helpful , i get plenty of things how to work in holidays package how to make packages according to visa, airfare , hotel , side seen everything in detail in training how to use the and operate the software deep knowledge about different destination like dubai, thailand , singapore, malaysia.the most hard part is the shift timing too long . but unfortunately make my trip shift to kolkatta."
good,I was rehired in Convergys as Quality Analyst for AT&T process. I was very happy with my job however later process started to ramp down and one day we got to know that AT&T is now closed therefore we were asked to leave the company.
good,"This was my first job ever in a call center,I have in all the possible shifts from day to ate in the night.This role was very challenging,dynamic,interesting,rewarding and fun.Our client was a telephone company and we had to solve customer queries,take bill payments,solve issues and make on call sales.We would speak to atleast 100-150 cutomers a day and calls would last 5 min to 30 min.It was very fulfilling to solve customer queries and end the call with a satisfied customer."

good,"-Great co. for freshers as they train you well to get into the market."
good,"I get different calls every time. Some were about billing, others were about purchasing requests, but mostly were about troubleshooting. The workplace was good because there were a lot of activities just to help us stay awake and energized and because of that, I learned that that working in this industry is never easy. It really takes effort and commitment in order to survive in this kind of job. The hardest part of the job was when customers call because of their billing statements.On the other hand, the most enjoyable part was meeting different kinds of people."
good,I was there over 8 years ago so I can't recall anything specific.  I do remember that I loved my coworkers and that it was bright and well ventilated.
good,"I like this company. The incentives, the people I get along with, and even the culture is good if you're in the right LOB. I will always admire this company from time to time because I learned a lot from it."

good,I have worked for Convergy's for 5 + years and have been unsure about leaving as a result of the working environment because Convergy's has always been a welcoming company. I like that I can approach anyone from the management team and ask questions and they guide me in the direction to solve a problem.
good,"Helping Business owners with their internet, phone, Voice Override IP systems, Cable and security systems via the internet and phone services in the area."
good,"i had a good exprince in concentrix and i learned how to build myself in work field ....."
good,I worked for convergys a couple times and loved it. When our jobs where secure. I found out the had way that jobs in a call center are never forever. My project was sent overseas so that really hurt me. But as a company i think it was pretty good.
good,"As the organization was erstwhile IBM, it has a great organizational structure with regards to Learning and development. Operational Development training's are proactively encouraged by the leadership."
good,"Convergys provides a good environment to work and grow. Also, it encourages a good work-life balance. I follows certain best practices which enable employees to groom themselves for future leadership roles."
good,Convergys is a challenging a d rewarding place to work. The people you work with have a real passion for customer service. Yes there are some opportunities to make it  enter however the positives far out weigh them.
good,In this line of business you will be taking inbound calls giving technical support. You may deal with angry people. The goal of this job is to get positive surveys from the customers. There is not much opportunity to advance within this company.
good,"Fantastic work culture. Great people. Learnt a lot about how to bring the best out of people. Management styles can vary, but most leaders at Convergys are very good at what they do. Typical day? SELL SELL SELL SELL!!!!"
good,"Convergys is one of the most renowned Contact Center. Except for few people in the Management, it is an amazing place to work. I have learnt a lot from my seniors and co-workers."

good,"answering phone lines all day. The most enjoyable part of the day is Lunch time, it gives you a break from answering phones all day. The work place culture is great"
good,"Nearing 3 years with Convergys, it has been a great experience so far. I have worked with three different process; to name Orange, EE and Microsoft. The level of responsibilities has been absolutely different with all the process. However with the current profile in Microsoft the employee engagement aspect has gone down subsequently. I find people constantly engaged or submerged so to say in a pool of responsibilities which can bring adverse effect to the balance of work & life. The management has already been hit by a good percentage of attrition as they could not figure out ways to keep the employees motivated for a fruitful future ahead. However, both side transportation is a huge benefit for the employees as there are very few in the competition to offer."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."

good,"Call center work environment. Receive inbound calls from customers wanting to review their services. I learned that people on the phone are not as polite. Management was flexible about who stayed and who went out the door. Co-workers for the most part were pretty good. Hardest part of the job was keeping your job. But that is the way of call center work. If your numbers are high you have a job. If your numbers are low you can expect to go in three months or less."
good,"It's a good place to have your 40 hours guaranteed, and health benefits. The management could use some work, it is micromanaging at it's worst. No one is on the same page. Needs better communication."

good,"Job wasn't really difficult, people you work with are mostly good hard working people. The turnover rate was a little overboard and the politics like any other call center where off the charts."
good,"Great place to grow and learn new skills. It is a BPO so there is a high performance culture for both entry level and staff level employees, as the service you are providing to clients is outsourcing. On most programs Agents will learn how to and be required to meet and balance multiple metrics and goals, and leaders will be required to maximize their productivity on a consistent basis to be effective.

I do 1 on 1 coaching's with every agent every week and we have team meetings once a week.  If a member of my team is not meeting the clients goals I help the agent figure out what will make them successful in reaching those goals.  The hardest part of my job is firing a member of my team. Having said that I do understand that Convergys pays me to do my job and that is part of my job so I leave that feeling at the door.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the daily interaction with my team, fellow Team Leaders and the customers."

good,Charter was one of the best places to work. It had lots of diverse cultures and there was never a boring day. The only thing that I had a problem with was their points system. If you occur up to 12 points you are subject to termination however some of the times the points are added when they shouldn't be because it is a computer system that adds the points not an actual person. Once you have those points it is very difficult to get your supervisor to remove them if you are not supposed to have them and you do get disciplined for the points that you have even if you are not supposed to have that many points in the first place. Management also likes to show favoritism.

good,"Working for this company had some great benefits! For many people an average position would mean that you miss out on dropping children off/picking them up from school, taking care of important bills or errands that require day-time attendance-that simply cannot be done without taking time off of work. Most shifts are ""split shifts"" in which many coworkers could still be part of their children's lives, while still being able to work.

good,Working at convergys was fun and enjoyable. The pay rate was resonable and the benefits they offer for insurance was great. I had learned alot about call center work at the company since when i started i had no experience with call center jobs. The company is very good at working with employees that have no prior experience with working in a call center. The hardest part was angry irrate customers that had descrepancies about there service.

The most enjoyable part of the job are the potlucks on lunch break within teams to encourage team work."

I have learned to manage my time by being punctual in coming to work, interact with my colleagues, share best practices for the benefit of the team and for the company most esecially. The hardest part of the job is being on the night shift most of the time however, I was able to find a way to live a balanced personal and working lifestyle.

good,"Your first shift likely won't be an early shift, unless someone in your training class trades you before they get fired.

Employees would then assist the patient with whatever they needed, for example, filling prescriptions or getting in touch with a pharmacist. I learned the names of various medications and their uses as well as more pharmaceutical knowledge. Management was strict at times but very helpful when employees were faced with problems. The hardest part of this job would be having to calm down angry callers when they had to be transferred or if there wasn't a problem that you could solve yourself.

good,A typical day at work is an intense day with high call volumes to accommodate. I learned how to maintain self control when dealing with irate customers.

The hardest part about the job was adapting to learning on your own because staff were mostly busy with other customers.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the flexible work schedules that were available.

Our Team Leader rewards us by drawing names for those with the most sales, with the lowest AHT and ACW. When our team members see one another not performing at their best we as Captains would jack in with them and help them out. The hardest part of my work is trying to sell warranties. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting rewarded when you are doing a great job, having pot lucks, being able to help one another out, and most important is making sure the customers are having before they get off the phone with me."
good,Typical day a work is the customer experience  and addressing there issue with the tool that makes your job easy.What I learned is learning materials can change over night to me it keeps the job interesting.

I learned how to deal with angry customers, resolve their issues and always make notes in an account that I open. My manager was a big help during times that were difficult and was available to assist me. If our manager was unavailable my co-workers would help assisting in your call as far as how to resolve the issue if they didn't have a call on their line. The hardest part of the job was keeping the customer calm while fixing the problem. Most of the time it required you to make casual conversation while working on the computer to fix their issue.

The Team leaders were very helpful and knowlegable in their areas and my co workers and I got along very well.

I also didn't have hardly any interaction with my coworkers which I didn't like. It was just kind of lonely and boring. Maybe it was just at this one call center, but like I said I will work a call center job and would work my hardest but would rather an active job! The best part of the job was that it was secure and you can always get back on there if needed. And the worst part was the pay. 9.00 just doesn't cover it."

Convergys gave me the opportunity to become an excellent Customer Service Representative. I communicated with a wide variety of professionals and customers nationwide. I am very grateful for my employment with Convergys. Due to the expiration dates of the contracts you had to be flexible, willing to learn and work where needed. I value transferring to other positions to expand my work experience, knowledge and skills. Management was great, especially with assisting you in area that you wasn't familiar with. Management was wonderful with encouraging you to excel. "

The hardest part of the job is when you get sick due to lack of sleep or during rainy season and the most enjoyable part of the job is when your performance are being recognized by the management as well as the customer."
good,I loved working for Minacs. I loved that it was fast-paced and there were oportunities to get bonuses but they were not very flexible if you had issues at home with kids being sick and or you beiung sick they are very strict with the miss so many days and you are out withouth any leway for why you may have been out.
good,"My general day consisted of answering several calls a day and assisting customers with their bill, problems with their phone, and any other customer service questions asked. I learned how to deal with irate customers with empathy and caring and how to troubleshoot phones with issues. My coworkers were nice but working with this company didn't provide a conducive relationship between employees."

good,fun work environment great PTO and UTO options of posting up shifts for others to pick up and availability of lots of OVERTIME $$$
good,A typical day at work we would learn on how to answer questions the customer may have. We would learn how to look up the information on our own. Learn the different programs on the computer and how to keep our call time low. The managers would help in teaching us and help us with any questions we might have. My co-workers would be doing the same but we would all help each other in any way we can. We were all in the same group and would enjoy talking with each other. The hardest part for me was learning all the information and applying it to the customers in a short time. The enjoyable part for me was meeting so many different people.
good,"Helping customers with their internet issues and other issues that involve internet, telephone, and cable"
good,Overall Convergys is a good place to work. The people are friendly and the management was very helpful when needed. The most enjoyable part of working at Convergys was the training it was very detailed and prepared for the time ahead.
good,▪ Resolve online banking issues for clients
good,"Although there are some great benefits for working for Convergys, some of the staff that your have to work with are often less then appropriate and respectful."
good,Taking phone calls for the Census program was a little difficult. I had people want to call the cops on me. They wanted to make sure I really was part of the Census and not looking to get their information. The managers were always there for you if you had a difficult call to handle.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,co workers are fun to work with and a great support team.
good,"A typical day at work consists of handling at least 30 calls daily concerning customers bills and services. We work in a professional environment with many other people. I've learned many new things being that this was my first job at a call center it's a new experience for me since I've always had interaction with customers in person most of the time never 100% over the phone only. I've learned many new computer systems and how to handle customer concerns over the phone in a professional and confident manner while navigating through several systems to resolve the issues. The hardest part of the job is when we have a difficult issue and need assistance of a manager or supervisor and no one is there to assist or it takes long to get someone then the customer gets more upset. But on the other hand, what I do enjoy the most from my job is turning upset customers into happy satisfied ones because it makes me feel like I have resolved our issues to completion and performed my job above and beyond and being recognized when scores are submitted on the overall customer service."
good,Gained lots of experience here. Worked with some really good people who I wish the best.
good,If you have worked many call centers and are tired of the work either going down or being eliminated then this is a company for you. They are international and never run out of clients you can work for so there is no stop in the almighty money.
good,the hardest part of the job was that the policies keep changing and they told us to do this then do that and i became confused as to what was right and what was wrong and we had short breaks and luches i did not feel like my lunch was long enough i would like for it to be long enought without me having to rush to eat my food .at night the building would get really hot and i cant work well in a hot environment.
good,"the job was OK to have I've learned to be more sure when talking with customers since this is a telecommunications job, so when relying information you have to sound sure in your voice. That would be something I've took with me in my experience of working here."
good,"Convergys is not a horrible place to work, typically the people make it horrible. The reason most complain is because of the amount of work required at the rate of pay received. People are typically friendly some even outgoing. Community outreach is present. Employee engagement is great."
good,"Good company to earn money and work for. But they have a serious problem scheduling agent, it's different every day and they can change it in the last minute so you can be affected in your attendance. Also it's very hard the opportunities to advance to a supervisory position because you have to be the boss friend, they don't really care about your knowledge and dedication to work."
good,"Providing customer service for customers calling in to exchange their week through RCI, deposit their weeks, extend their week, or to combine deposits. To payment over the phone, searched for places they would like to exchange."
good,Its a great starter job company to have with plenty of room for advancement.
good,"I learned how to deal wit customers with different issues going on wit their account, such as very anger customers. Everyone is nice and motiviated, and the co worker make the job more exciting."

good,"Considering that they're closed, this was a pretty good job, the only thing I didnt like was that they didnt give grievance for siblings."
good,"* Business Practices are updated daily, so one has to check emails and\or 'chats' regularly."
good,"The job is pretty cool but not what I was expecting when hired, the HR position is more like customer service for the recruiting department. I prefer to engage with people face to face instead of via telephone, I love my team we do work hard to motivate each other. I just wish my schedule would stay the same instead of coming to work and I am working mornings one week and nights the next. It really limits my personal life."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."

good,The job was good it provided enough income for me to pay my bills and still make good friends while at work.
good,"When i first started working for convergys it was in orem for the PST and i absolutely loved it. I then moved to Ogden and was excited to learn there was a Convergys down here.... the management and overall experience at the Ogden site was total opposite from the one I had in Orem. The HR Rep was mean and made me feel belittled, i never met the main boss, the Team leads knew less than I did. Just overall not a good experience at the Ogden site."
good,"I had a great time doing collections, i never thought i would go into that area but the management there could take some courtesy training"
good,"I worked at the lowest level, a customer service rep for cingular wireless, and I found that a sufficient amount of training was not provided, you were pushed onto the sales floor, in your own little gray cubicle. Just not for me, but I know plenty of people who are making a career out of working for Convergys."
good,"Convergys is a great place to learn skills that will transfer to any job you choose to have. Convergys offers great informational training, hand on activities, and effective system training for associates."
good,"Concentrix is a very fast paced, sales focused company. It was very rewarding for those who are very target driven however the bonuses were very hard to earn as they set unrealistic targets."
good,"For me, I can take the job and do it very well but the salary is not enough. The management is all good specially my supervisor, that the only issue that I have."
good,"Concentrix overall is a good place to work. There are a lot of changes that could be made and improvements but that's with any job.  Overall, good place to work just have to adopt quickly."
good,"Concentrix is a huge company with so many different cultures, colours, shapes and sizes. Meeting so many new people has been amazing. "
good,A good place to work in where people are trained on how to handle phone in inquiries about flight details. A good training ground for the flight industry.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"For fresher it's a good company to start and employees are very cooperative ."
good,"The company is a great place to hone your skills not only in communication but also in self-discipline. Your communication skills will surely improve since you will be talking to English speaking people the whole shift. Self-discipline will also be enhanced because you will have to teach yourself to adjust on the shift schedules provided for you. From this company, I learned to be patient in talking to others. Be patient in letting the clients understand the cause of their problem and provide a solution to ease the stress that they are feeling. The hardest part of the job was having clients who will rant and say negative words to you but you just have to accept it so not to create conflict. The fun part is that, you have colleagues who are willing to help you and share these experiences with."
good,"The company has better Platform for employee, with good salary / allowance availability. Management  also supportive and very average job satisfaction"
good,very flexible time and the management will take care of the employee very well. Able to communicate with your manager regarding your job  as well there is any problem on the floor .
good,Not much was learned here but the ever changing medical world in which we live in. That I learned while on the job training. Management was about the same as all my call center jobs. They were over worked and under paid like the rest of us. I'd probably say the hardest part of that job was the moral because it was very stressful trying to make those numbers. The most enjoyable part of that job was the customers and helping them with their orders and refilling their rx proscriptions.
good,I liked working here. It was a good place to start off with customer service because it taught me a lot. The programs were easy to use after training.
good,"It is a good place to work to get your foot in the door for call center experience, although I can't see it being a long term career path. They are vendors for different companies so other departments may have different opportunities."
good,At Concentrix there are different vendors that you can work for. So are solely just based on customer service and some are sales based. It really depends on what you are looking for. I worked doing customer service only. HR was very reachable and responsive.
good,The training class was fun and informative they help you a lot. You will be prepared but you will not know until you work for about a week. The goals are not hard and your calls will be graded weekly.
good,Working there was decent. All of our interactions were via chat so we didn't take phone calls. Pretty easy going and laid back and it wasn't skipper stressful. It was definitely unfortunate when almost everyone was laid off and therefore are unable to yea rehireable.
good,"Concentrix is a decent place to work, however the project. Im working on is evaluated on sales,it doesn't matter how good your customer service skills are, the goal is to take as much money you can from members, and that determines whether you have a job or your walked out the door."
good,"condition adéquate libre de faire la gestion structurelle, Travail très stimulant encadrement parfait et une superbe équipe professionnelle. formation bien structuré. Très bon employeur"
good,"For people that have worked there for several years, most of them say they have moved from one project to the next every few years or so. It can become difficult to get accustomed to a particular project or position with that kind of instability. One day, there may be a list of new jobs offered for advancement on an upcoming project, then suddenly, the project pulls out and you're stuck without a job for a few weeks until they start the whole hiring process all over again and find you a new project."
good,"I worked 1st shift. Loved it. Had it's stress days along with very slow and boring. Most managers were awesome, their bosses, not so much. Bidding on shifts was horrible. I was lucky to get what I wanted, until they no longer wanted me. Claim to be temporary jobs, but they don't tell you that, when you are hired.  Most work at home jobs are similar. Keep that in mind if its what you need. They listen to your calls, understandably, to help you succeed. But some of the people doing the criticizing made it their mission to cut you down. If they didn't like you, the would always pick you apart, no matter how good your performance was."
good,Pleasure to work in this MNC but salary is the major issue .... Awesome work environment and friendly nature of team leaders make work more easier....
good,"For the first year it was a good place to work. The company worked with me when I needed time off for health reasons. The deciding factor for me to leave was when we went from a Customer Retention Department to having to pitch a cell phone on every call, no matter if the account was open, closed, or the reason why the customer was calling. After a while it got to the point that if you were not offering it on every call then you were written up & terminated. "
good,"Overall nice place to work for couple of years , since I want challenging things I guess it’s time to move on."
good,"Typical day would be eight hours on the phone taking incoming phone calls. Work wise - if you did everything that was accepted pf you to do, it was a breeze."
good,Pay needs to be increased benefits although they have them are way to expensive to have 401 is ok dental is ok but rest to expensive have to meet your metrics or be fired
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,The policies are fair. Pay could be better. Friendly people. If you stay good with attendance you can advance quickly. It is a good place to work. Try it out.
good,"Buen ambiente labora entre compañeros, sin embargo a los lideres les falta pro actividad e imaginación. "
good,"I started in a position had the potential for growth, but had to leave the position for 4 weeks. When I returned, I was put on another project which I enjoyed. It was a smaller project and the training was extensive."
good,The job is really  good and the company gave us the freedom to engage with different personality and nationality and I was able to show my skills in this company.
good,"My typical day at work consists of helping customers with their issues when they are running their assisted payroll program. I was given the opportunity to learn a new career that is totally fascinating to me at this point in my life. I have always wanted to work with payroll or taxes or numbers in general. However, there are some limitations as to what is available to me to give my customer the best possible treatment that I can provide with limited tools. There are numerous resources to reach out to use, but at times they are limited also."
good,An interesting place to work. The hardest part of the job is just learning to train your brain to be a customer service representative.  The best part is helping people.
good,Time management is most essential. Hardest part of the job was learning to keep your cool during bad calls and realizing its part of the job. Pay is good.
good,"Convergys was a very exciting and well organize place to work at they, help me advance and grow my career opportunities.  The benefits at convergys was tremendously exceptional,  The growth opportunities their are never ending as you have the opportunity to be at the highest of the ladder while starting from the very bottom."
good,"It was a really good place to work , management was really cooperative and helpful. Proper training were provided before the sending employees to work on floor."
good,"The ""C"" in Convergys means constant changing environment, which at times leads to internal chaos"
good,"When you work hard and show that you are ready for advancement, there is always opportunity. Also when there is always events and company functions that are very inclusive."
good,"My expectations is not met but the workplace is good. I just love the priviledges to have big discounts in golds gym and free clinic, healthcard and also has a gender equality"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Convergys, now Concentrix."
good,It was work at home opportunity. The hiring process was not long and you can definitely ask during training. The company is a good company and it’s like most call center job with metrics that are important. You get reviews and chances to get a raise. The raises are very low.
good,"I had a good experience working for Convergys, they offer a clean enviroment and many oportunities. Their rules are clear and fair and the supervisors and staff in charge are very welcomeing and willing to help."
good,if you are looking for a place to start out at this would be it. the pay is fair and they have several departments to work in so you don't feel stuck in 1 place
good,"With the largest & loudest department, we kept the lights on for the whole building. Though management was few in #, we kept collectors motivated and hungry."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,I would answer calls for walgreens about peoples prescriptions & I would let.them know if they would be available for pick upI enjoyed working here and would recommend it to friends & family.
good,"Convergys was fast-paced. I was a customer service representative for DirecTV. I worked in a call center in which my job duties were to activate acts, added programming, processed payments and performed basic troubleshooting duties."
good,It was a very relaxed work place.the team lead i had was very knowledgeable and didnt mind helping us. The overtime was sometimes mandatory but its mostly voluntary.
good,"Had fun almost everyday working there, the problem is that the policies made our jobs alot harder than it has to be. However, still doable, I even got a best agent award. twice."
good,"- Sufficient time for training (1.5 months)"
good,Keep your phone off the floor when working I learned the hard way. This job is for someone that can manage their selves well. Stay on your toes and always remember the customer is first!
good,the company will help you reach your goal. they help employees to reach success thru promotions without hesitation and discrimination. they will help you improve and strengthen skills.
good,"I learned different things at Convergys, but the most unforgettable would be how to handle difficult people. I was tasked to handle people with banking problems and Convergys taught us on how to communicate with them."
good,Did have vendor days 2-3 times a week. Did buy pizza for agents at different times. also had special weeks with different activities/treats for the employees
good,Convergys is a great place to work and has afforded me the opportunity to work with so many people at all levels of the organization.  I recommend the company
good,"The workplace is nice"
good,"they figured out how to replace 600 workers with an Ipad I had a great time but your just a number,they dont give a hoot about you but the pay rocked."
good,Training classes were very helpful to get me ready for when i went and started taking phone calls. Management was always very helpful and willing to help out.
good,"Convergys is not a bad place to work. However, if you are looking to advance within the company it is hard. I WAH and have been in management but demoted when business slowed down. They tend to hire people from within the call center that they know instead of looking at all qualified candidates."
good,Good balance of internal management style meetings vs time needed to actually do the work.  Positive management support and involvement in client service efforts.
good,"Great place to start if you are new at the BPO industry "
good,"Stable BPO company though it's  gonna be merging  with Concentrix."
good,"Like many other jobs the company comes first. But they do have great management in place to help with the training and your role. Downside is on my contract your manager changes every few months, as does your schedule. When they tell you you need open availability they mean it. Not having set hours was something that made this job a little more difficult for me. They have amazing team work and just job culture as a whole even from the work at home side that I was on."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"An advisor has to have patience, and care enough to assist others. Have to be able to research swiftly, change, and adapt to various customers phoning in to the support center."
good,Convergys was a good place to work.  I wish they had more development classes to help with understanding of what the drugs did.  I was living in both Sierra Vista and Tucson at the time of employment and was having trouble with tardiness due to the border patrol which could take over an hour.  I wish they were more understanding of my situation at that time.  But I understand their position as well.  I have moved permanently to Tucson and now have the ability to make work on time.
good,The company is okay. The management is not so good but the people are great.. Its hard to file a leave but the incentives are great. The management doesnt seem to care for their advisors.
good,A great job for kids just getting out of school. Is money and great place to get your work experience up. Full time hours and flexible schedules. also great if you want overtime hours
good,"the job itself isnt really bad, its the lack of willingness to help employees who are lower than a team leader, most of the time it's ""Did you find it in the Answer center, everything is in the Answer center."""
good,The job was great the management not so much.  I handled on average 20-30 calls a day depending on the volume.  I was very hands on tech support and enjoyed the customers I got to work with.
good,"Good environment to work, decent staff, management is ok, work culture is good, spent more than a year as a Sr. Technical support specialist in a ISP process assisting Australian customers with internet issues."
good,this company provides good training and really helped me develop my skills. there is great support from everyone and they use a group chat where you can always get help if your not sure about something. all my supervisors were great to work with.
good,Running tests on the Onstar system and creating defects to resolve issues behind the scenes before rolled out to the public. Management is there to assist in meeting expected goals.
good,Its better to have a comfortable working place so that employees can enjoy their work. Management should treat their employees equally it is not only based on yhe position and salary
good,Customers would call with a variety of issues and you were required to maintain a professional attitude at all times. Advancement possibilities and lots of overtime available when needed by the supervising staff members.
good,At Concentrix it was very busy and condence.  So much to learn at such a fast pace.  I enjoyed working with my peers and enjoyed being on the phone with customers.  The hardest part of the job was not getting enough time to prove myself. Was so looking forward to return to the job but didn't get a call back
good,"I am a very flexible person, but in my first year at Concentrix, I worked six (6) differant work schedules due to training, switching departments twice, and schedule bids. I have work very early morning hours, I have worked midnights and I have worked on holidays. Great place to work if you do not have small children to worry about."
good,Working at Convergy's was very interesting because you had to assist different customers with the issues of concerns with their service. It was always a joy to fix the problem and have a happy customer
good,"The work environment was a relaxing job. As long as you did your job as best as you could, you would not have to worry about managers on your back. Managers were there if you needed them but overall the job was for self."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,im not very good at talking to people but it was a prity good job didnt have much to complain about freindly work environment it is not a bad job it was only temporary for me.
good,company is good job security was there but shift hours are to long. 5 days working. Any 2 weekly off. Stressful job.. Management is good. Salary is less and promotion is very slow
good,"1. Regular work for technical support on call"
good,"Its full of politics, people who are eligible enough are not given a chance to level up. Since some people are in factions or in an organization outside the company are prioritized"
good,Not your average salary compared to other BPO companies. Low basic pay but good with program allowances and incentives. Very friendly and a healthy environment
good,"Limited advancement options, workplace culture is focused on day to day activities to meat client goals and exceed production requirements. However not much focus is placed on career building and advancement of middle management."
good,"I'm happy to work in convergys because this is my first time to work as a call center agent. Productive because always updated , have fun to work because all the agents are always smiling."
good,"Cafeteria was very convenient. Friendly workplace, some incentives. Staff is friendly and great trainers. Employee of the month parking, 100% attendance luncheon."
good,Job site was great ample amount of space and technology to explore and learn. People from all around India together at the same workplace. I learned to troubleshoot various internet issues and provide the customer a quick and the best possible resolution.
good,"I can only say great things about my site leadership and the agents who reported under me. If Convergys had not moved our jobs oversees I would still be their now because of the support my site leadership team has shown me and my commitment to my agents who I cared about as people, not just some set of numbers on a spread sheet.  Call Centers as a whole have forgotten that with out the agents manning the phones they would not exist. At least that is how they project themselves from a corporate standing as only the bottom line is seen by the higher powers that make the determinations that impact individual sites and contracts. I get it, they are in business to make money and the day of truly caring about your employees and the lives you impact with the flick of a pen or push of a button have passed.  Hence, my summary - End of an Age..."
good,"Like any other BPO company, it requires time and effort. The management and the people in the company are really friendly and competitive when it comes to work."
good,My job day consist of signing customers up with American Express Cards and informing customers if they are approved or denied. The hardest part of my job consisted of telling the customers they were denied after going through the long application process.
good,some changes needed like more recreational facilities when not working. there's enough land space to have like a tennis court and basketball court for employees' use
good,a call center environment with lots of people laughing and joking between incoming calls. Lots of benefits available like discounted Direct TV. Diverse work environment.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Working in the company had provide the development of my social skills not just with your co-workers but with your own customers as well. Their is the advancement of skill set and development of talents and knowledge that could help for future goals.
good,"The company is good however it does not have a good incentive program which sometimes result in losing headcounts. However, people in the company are nice and easy to approach."
good,"This was my first job and I can say it really helped me to be responsible and enhanced my critical thinking. Also I was surrounded with good tl, trainers and fellow agents making the job light. "
good,"Working at Convergys I had the privilege to work under a manager that encouraged growth, he was an incredible leader. Once he left our division the culture changed and the team started to fragment. On a whole Convergys"
good,"I thanks very much to this Company. Because this give me to opportunity to start my career in BPO. I never want to disclose from this company, But After I got my marriege I was not comfortable for Consecutive Night Shift."
good,Its a good company but they have to work upon there management. The time breakups for lunch and coffee tea is really less. This is a tough process but it can be made fun to work without putting so much pressure on employes
good,"Call center life is not for everyone but if you like to sit on your behind, talk on the phone, be around friends with a temperature controlled environment then it might be for you."
good,Simple and well defined. I liked working with Convergys. I also learned and gained confidence. But growth nowadays is not  that visible. ITES job experience being non technical is seldom useful.
good,"I had to arrive at my desk 5 minutes before my day started, and clock in to start my day. I would log into all my systems put on my headset turn the phone system on and wait for my 1st call. My calls will start high volume throughout the day up until my 1st break and up to lunch time. After my 30 minute lunch calls will continue to be back to back into the end of my shift. Sometimes calls would come in 2 to 3 minutes apart but mostly high volume. The calls make the day go by faster. Working at a call center is straight to the point, answering calls all day is expected and I enjoyed it. Some calls where easy to handle and some was difficult. I worked 5 days and 2 days off."
good,"Not all call centers are equal. Convergys offers a variety of projects to work for- over my 7 years I worked for 4 different projects, advancing in each position. They hired too many managers for one project, and decided that they were going to lay off 5 our of 7 people. They did offer a job in another department, however stated that the rate I was making before the promotion was above the new pay cap and told me that I would be making less hourly than I was before the promotion. They are bottom-line types, they don't care about long time employees and only value what is best for them. They have a high turn-over rate because of this."
good,"One of the good place to work. Supportive management and work environment is very nice."
good,"I enjoyed my job, I listened to the members and assisted them in anyway that I could. Main object was to ensure the members comfort with the mail order pharmacy."
good,"This company has a lot of events, they have cheerleading competitions, Convergys Idols (singing competition), dance competitions, and a lot more. Fun place to work. The only down-side is seat shortage. Some agents are being sent home if we are over-staffed for the day, but aside from this they have a great culture there."
good,This company is a nice company to work for but it needs alot of changes within the managment team.every year we have to relocate within the company to another positiin because we either lost our contract or it was seasonal.
good,relaxed work environment not a drastic dress code kind of disorganized high turn over lack of advancement opportunities low paying benefits were decent and competitive employer contribution
good,"This is the perfect part time job, very flexible with school schedule."
good,"I think the company gets a bad rep based on these reviews. The people you work around are great, but the job is fast paced and not for everyone. I figured out shortly after getting out of training and on the phones the job wasn't right for me. The trainers, managers, coworkers are very friendly and realistic at the same time so as long as you're putting in the work you will be fine. Selling is a big topic that many people say is necessary for you to keep your job and that's not true, if you're at least making an offer and trying to overcome objections then your job is safe. I figured out early on that it wasn't for me and I was driving 30+ minutes to get there so I found something closer to my area is why I left."
good,"Has good working environment, uncomplicated job description. Good security performance.However, salary and health benefits need improvement. Management need to be more sensitive of their employees' needs."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Started my career along with the process Dell in Convergys and grown with it. Gained a lot of process knowledge and learned as how to grown as a team not only individually. "
good,The work itself is good including the location however when it come to work schedules its not that fixed and hard to file leave because of the prioritization of the management in which is not healthy because they're not fair.
good,"the project i was in was wasy to learn and training was only two weeks, the pay was okay for how easy it was. lack of managment or someone to go to if you have questions but other than that it was a good job."
good,"Convergys can be a great place to work, I've found several friends there. Policies can differ from project to project, and so far BCBS has some strict policies about accuracy, however as long as I've been there it's been great!"
good,"a typical day is clocking in and taking calls right away"
good,"slow growth"
good,"I liked it there, I got along with everyone, all the managers and colleges loved me, it felt like a second family. The teams I was on  and managers always came together to make sure we all provided great customer service and had a good day while working togther. I just needed better pay for the work I provided."
good,"All in all, highest paid company I worked with. It's a fun place too. Hardest part of the job was performing troubleshooting which I also learned to deal with afterwards. Kind people too are there, every Friday there's a singing event where agents with talents do perform at the stage, I find that very cool and fun."
good,"As in any other BPO company, Convergys is diverse, colorful, challenging and rewarding. I have worked with people of different characteristics, and yet on the floor, we all pull together to deliver."
good,Twas alright. Management really was inadequate. The bonus structure was very nice and appreciated. Hours were fairly flexible. Friendly workplace culture.
good,I got the opportunity to be a Workforce intern in 4 months. They listened to us when we suggested that they move the Recruitment office near the Taguig Office.
good,"Convergy's is a great professional place to work, Overall i have to say it has been the best place i've ever worked. The more you show up to work the more hours you gain for PTO."
good,"Job is pretty cool. Could Pay more. The hours are pretty good. Guaranteed 40 hours a week. Overtime always available, you receive discounts and benefits."
good,Convergys is a great company who takes care of their employees! Its not the company its self it's the project that doesn't look after there employees.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"I enjoyed learning new skill sets. The work environment is self paced. However there is no room for advancement  which makes one feel like their job is constantly in jeopardy. The employees are friendly, however they don't cater to tenures, at any moment  someone who has been here far less longer has just as much opportunity for advancement as you have, and the farther up you go the more responsibility  you have with the same amount of pay."
good,Convergys is a fun place to work at. They have great healtjcare benefits and easy vacation leaves application. workplace is fun with themeday. Pantry is also great with food concessionaires that serves variety of viands.
good,"Convergy is one of the top most BPO company in India, it is known for quality customer service and efficiency to deal with the customers. I worked there for almost a year where I joined there a freshman right after my collage graduation and during this duration I never encountered any major issue with my higher authority or the management  department, which I'll treasured  the good times  I've spent with them. I love the working environment, the building campus.  As this is a big company meeting new people with different ethnicity isn't difficult where everyone respect one's identity and where you are from. Though the company's building is a bit far away from North Delhi they provide the best transportation facilities that is pick and drop right at your front door. So I love every bit of this company and I wish they will grow bigger and better in a days to come."
good,Throughout my career at Convergys it was great to meet so many people an make a impact in their lives. I was able to earn great leadership skills. I'm very thankful for the opportunity.
good,Working at Concentrix was fast-paced and exciting. There was always something new to learn and they made sure you got the training needed to perform your job.
good,"lots of overtime and rotating shifts, easy work and very short but easy training, helpfuls team leads, has cafertia and good benefits, provides lockers for personal belongings."
good,"Good company but poor management especially career opportunities are not enough and most of the time, subjective. "
good,Concentrix will teach you the basics about how to have outstanding customer service and the necessary requirements on how to treat the customers awesome
good,"Was wonderful to work in midwest culture."
good,"It is really nice to work for a company where you can be satisfied with a day's work. I learned how to be patient and tactfully reason with difficult clients. The workplace culture is unified, thus providing an encouraging environment to work within. The hardest part of the job is to deal with technical difficulties when using the provided tools needed to perform. However, the most pleasant part of the job is the constant learning and the constant pursuit of customers' satisfaction."
good,Process is good during my stay in UP site and differ in Eton site which is not organized like the Recruitment department. No pantry during morning shift and weekends. Unpaid overtime for meetings.
good,It was very good and learning experience with Concentrix. they have to Maintain professional and friendly atmosphere at a workplace. Management is very helpful in terms of growth and Learning.
good,"The workplace is okay and there are a lot of people you can meet. Even if the shift is different, you can still adjust because your peers will help you."
good,I have learnt lot of things from concentrix. And it's a good company. We work 24/7 in concentrix daksh. It's a good company for fresher as well as experience.
good,"*  working with this company has given me a lot of experience interacting with other persons (may it be local or international)"
good,"Good working environment, good facilities and accommodating people... "
good,If you like call center jobs this one is pretty comparable to any other out there. It's been a while since I worked there so I don't know how much has changed since I left.
good,the top management need to make sure that their unit managers are doing their job in a decent manner.make sure that the front workers are being taken care of because the success of d company relies to them.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"As a call center, taking inbound calls can be fun and tiring at the same time"
good,Good stable company who has been around for a long time. Work life balance is pretty good. Has good accounts and clients relationship.  Good salary ans benefits.
good,fun and productive because we are family there we have learned a lot since the first day of training. The hardest part of the job is to talk with irate customer.
good,"Stay  on your  toes, because  the  rug can be  pulled out from under you  at  any time. Here promises are made  to  be  broken. Work will be  steady  for  a  while  then everything falls apart. Scheduling is  so  bad  you  can never  make  plans in advance, it  changes at  a  minutes notice."
good,"Richmond, Va great location been here for 3 years , the most you will love about this place is the people. Great opportunities to advance. im looking."
good,good workplace but too hectic work . requred good staff and also incentive was not there..also ten hours shift and there was no option other than calling to be done thr must be flexible workplace .
good,"You will learn the way you need to work at corporate."
good,"This company provides good working environment for the employees but mostly the shifts are night, which makes me feel uncomfortable to work with. Overall the company is good."
good,Good experience and good quality  and have a good experience because they will teach you how to work with others and having a good time with customers and also good
good,Convrgys provide best transport facility to their employees. This is the best part which I have share to you. Convergys management is pathetic. They don't know how to manage the process.
good,"Good Organization to start a career."
good,"Decent money if you can put up with the customers. Systems are easy to use little downtime "
good,"As a fresh I joined, i really thankful to Concentrix company which throught me about team work, corporate atmosphere, rules and responsibilities achieve."
good,"its a fun  place and  healthy environment , and a good salary ."
good,"Typically your day working for Convergys involved logging into your systems in a minimal amount of time and then taking phone calls the remainder of the day.  Your job depends on the project your in, but typically involves customer service followed up by some kind of sales pitch.  You'll note that breaks are pre-scheduled and for some projects schedule adherence is an absolute must.  While they have high expectations of their employees they provide ample opportunities to learn what to do and how to do it well.  The management was fantastic, the workplace culture was too.  You could tell just how much employees cared for each other.  The hardest part of the job was keeping metrics to the exact numbers they wanted, the most enjoyable part was finding a customer who enjoyed talking to you and then enjoying your conversation."
good,This place is great to work for but your points catch you very fast. Depending on the contract that you get on it can vary as to how much you enjoy it.
good,Best company to work . It's with large number of employees with excellent facility in all locations for the faculty. 7 Times Awarded as a Best company to work across the world.
good,Worked in several departments and enjoyed working in customer service. The hardest part of the job was the environment because the teams leads would push and push because doing a good job was not good enough.  They had incentives to earn production points.
good,"The best part about this job was the convenience store on the first floor. It's nice to be able to go on your break or lunch and head downstairs to make your purchases, as opposed to having to leave the property. "
good,"During my time at Concentrix, when it was known as Aditya Birla Minacs, my team leader was the main reason I stayed as she kept the atmosphere positive amid constant and abrupt changes to the tasks handed out and effectively kept us on task through strong leadership and people skills."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"It was my first job. "
good,It was a good experience in this company.Being an intern i got an exposure to work on MIS which is latest software use in HR. Majority of the Work of HR I learnt in HR.
good,"- excellent work life balance"
good,Good company to work for. Worked for over five years and started as an agent and moved up into leadership position under a year with good metrics and coaching abilities.
good,"problems with checks, managers acted very unfair.others managers acted nice. provided paid time off and vacation. clients over phone were very rude and had to sit there and take all the bad words and disrespect"
good,"> night shift schedules"
good,"Laid back mostly medium call volume easy job and a very friendly work environment, break room is lively, the food is good and they have gaming consoles."
good,"Customer Loyalty Group- incoming calls of upset customers. The training may take up to 10-12 weeks. My personal experience was that while in training, I worked with another trainee to help them overcome some issues they were having when it came to learning the systems and steps to completing tasks. I feel that I put in more effort for that individual than the actual trainer."
good,Cabs comes for pick and drop. Relaxed work environment. Helps you build yourself and you would learn a lot. Good Work and life balance. Company Gives you chances to grow and build yourself.
good,"It has been an exhilerating experience working at Convergys. Starting from day 1 till the last day, everything has been memorable working for this organisation."
good,"Professional looking company, however agents are subjected to get loud taking to one another. Phone calls coming in back to back which does not allow preparation time for the customer."
good,"My overall experience was ok, better than expected. If you're looking to acquire good benefits and steady pay... this company would be beneficial. Make sure you do as expected and you will maintain a good job."
good,nice company but management is poor. transport facility is poor . nice cafeteria and infrastructure. good growth chances and employee satisfaction. good salary
good,My position at concentrix is coming up on 3 and a half years and I love my job not just for what I do but the people I work with because in my position I get to be the face for a majority of the people who continue their employment with us as a company there are ups and downs with any job but that's to be expected nothing is perfect
good,Lack of Management in the Company.  There is nothing called as hierarchy in this company. Unnecessary rules and regulations and unnecessary parameters which is hard to achieve.
good,"an awesome first job if you're trying to get your foot in the door."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"I have greatly enjoyed my job in Convergys Phils. Inc. as a Customer Service Professional II for several years. I highly appreciate the challenges, the chance to meet and talk with people on daily basis that gave me sense of pride and satisfaction. I am very thankful for the guidance and the mentorship not only this job has provided but especially from my supervisors. Also,the management team, gave me the opportunity to work with such enthusiastic, productive and supportive team that no doubt my relationship has been more like a family and I have learned so much."
good,"Convergys is a nice place to work. When it comes to salary they are okay though sometimes the over time pay is not paid on time. There are many policy changes along the way, some are disclosed and some are not so other agents would tend to resign because the work is becoming too complicated. For me, I stayed in the company since they helped me a lot. The only reason though that I have for leaving is because I want a career move."
good,I do not care to submit a review at this time. I have had many years with this company and have gained much experiencing with data entry to customer service and sales.
good,"Decent place to work, good people keep leaving due to management issues and concerns that are not dealt with properly.  Ideas are listened to but rarely acted upon."
good,"Am a People manager who has an exceptional Interpersonal skills and manage Internal and External Stake holders with the best of there expectations compelling within the company limitations."
good,"8 hours you earn pto as you work so you can literally grab a day like once a week ."
good,"Overall it's ok working in Concentrix because it depends on the clients. "
good,"Friendly and productive place to work, plenty of benefits offered including paid time off, sick leave, over time, exc. able to work with your time schedule and flexibility on hours"
good,"Company have a good policies, except some. Nice workplace. work environment is good, team leads are very cooperative. Overall very helpful environment."
good,"This was my first experience working at a call center. It required a lot of focus to learn the customer service approach. Such as, responding to customers and the feedback needed to resolve customer issues. Sometimes it was difficult to find solutions based on the tools provided within the work place. The people were friendly. It was frustrating/hectic at times during inbound calls. The pay was ok, the benefits were ok too. leaving/quitting a place like that was difficult based on my personal time outside the workplace(my car broke down, and my absences didn't help much). It requires a lot of time and arrangement to have a steady, organized life."
good,"Inbound calls, helping customers to solve tv and other Direct TV equipment, Helping customers with financial problems with their accounts, troubleshooting networking problems etc."
good,"i loved my team- very friendly and helpful. we were hard working bees. good fun with them even we were working under pressure."
good,"Well, what I can say is that this is one of the best BPO company. I love the benefits that they have, specially when it comes to my account from where im asigned to."
good,"Schedule - I am in a way flexible to shifting."
good,Depending of what kind of project you get into you will either find yourself enjoying it or getting bored. If you don't mind helping customers on  the phone then and not having to actually deal with them face to face then this might help you out.
good,"The customer service associated with this position was awarding and I enjoyed being able to assist and help others. i interacted with all employees and staff, in a positive environment."
good,Good workplace experience but the salary is not rewarding but recommendable company to work with if you are newbie in BPO industry.
good,I had to try and get as many salessons as I could in a day. This varied from the amoutside of calls I took to the amount of sales I got. It was customers ringing up wanting to upgradevelop there phone. Some customers wereceive just enquiring and some wanted to leave Vodafone I had to convincwait some customers to stay the hardest part of the job was the conversion based as I did not pass my probation stage due to this.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"The hardest part of the job here is how you will handle your co workers attitude problems. You need to be flexible,  because they tend to change schedules every week.  TL's here are easy to to approach."
good,I work on a dayshift now which I have more time with my son. I learned how to communicate well with customers and prioritize customer's needs. I learned to multi-task. Workplace is comfortable and very clean (even the comfort rooms). Hardest part of the job is understanding the account itself (Accounting software) Also when I was still on a night/graveyard shift I have less time with family. Enjoyable part is when we have our family day/year end party and fun fridays.
good,"Environment was really rough, the job its self was good but the way they did things were a little unorganized. i learned a lot of skills for customer care, service, and relations. co-workers were very cool, the hardest part was getting in contact with you supervisor because most times they wont be at work, and the enjoyable part were the your co-workers."
good,It was complete fun to work at Comvergys. The colleagues were encouraging each other to perform and never ever it felt that I was under pressure. Team work was best practised.
good,Working in Concentrix was Fun but you have to do extra effort to balance Work and family. The company offer a very good compensation and benefits and Family Activities are always given importance.
good,Convergys is one of the best company most especially when we talk about benefits although sometimes its really stressful when working under too much pressure..
good,My 1st call centre experience and what I've noticed was my health doesn't fit with my work schedule cause it was grave yard shift and I need a morning shift schedule to secure my health.
good,This place was my absolute favorite job.The people here are just so amazing to work with. Team players! I love the energy that everyone brings to work everyday. We never allowed our personal lives to interfere with our professional life.
good,"the work schedule is quite different as you get to work graveyard shifts. however, the work can be taken lightly knowing that you would always have support from co-workers and supervisors in the production floor. every call is so distinct from the other that would enhance your analytical skills in providing resolution. the best part of the job is when clients are surveyed and you are given excellent feedbacks."
good,Its a great job helping customers to help with their technical needs and de-escalate their stress from the lack on knowledge of their internet issue. helping customers understand why their internet wasnt working due to thier computers configs and routers attributes was fulling but not a career i wanted to pursuit.
good,"It was a fun and friendly place to work. However, the projects are subject to end at any time and cause you to lose hours. Also, there is the possibility that you will not pass the requirements to join the next project."
good,"Up-lifting and upbeat place to work, easy area for growth. Nice staff feels like everyone is your family almost like a second home. Could use work on policies and correctives. Do not apply if you have young kids"
good,"I have learned that being involve in the airline industry takes a lot of patience and perseverance that you have to make sure that you put your heart in what you do, that excellence is achieved through hard work and passion."
good,"Productive workplace"
good,good benefits and career growth. somewhat positive coaching and minimal job coaching given. Location was not the best and commuting was difficult when it came to winter weather and not being able to remote in from home.
good,"A typical day at work is very challenging I've learned how to get along with the others, management was not really satisfying but it's quite better than the usual co workers were fine, hardest part of the job is that you are talking almost and sometimes over 9 hours, enjoyest part of the job is when you help the customer resolve the issue."
good,I had a great time working with this company. Company management and colleagues are very awesome. Salary is good also. But very long working hours.
good,Very disorganized but good paying Job. The interviews are quick but the waiting period to start is a bit long depending on the departmenr your going to.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,high turn over rate. high volume call center. no amenities or affordable benefits for employees. The hourly rate starts at $10 per hour.
good,Still I think that there is some challenges in terms of social life and other responsibility towards our family is lacking behind due to working in different shifts including late nights.
good,"Good job to work at , great stepping stone so i could be able to work at a AT&T call center  versus a third party company gave me that background knowledge that helped me later on."
good,Learned to provide services and promote company advertisements. Also trained to deal with escalated calls and troubleshoot customer problems
good,"I used to work for TWC billing department. The chat frequency for billing issue's was very less and more chat we used to receive for other queries because of that it was difficult maintain scores."
good,Most enjoyable part of the job is when there are activities that lets the agent participate for free.Co-workers are considerate and kind.Hardest part of the job is when we deal with irate customers.
good,"My work day usually consisted of solving customer issues such as Billing, Technical and Retention. Hardest part of the job was saving customers. If you like a challenge I would recommend this company. Work/Life balance wasn't as good as I had hoped."
good,"my account is a telecommunication company in Southern California,"
good,Convergys was areally nice organization to work for. the work atmosphere was fun and at the same time everyone was mindful of their work and deadlines. The management was very helpful and my co-workers were a great lot of people to work with.

good,"Stay also depends on co-workers."
good,"It's a friendly quiet place, I've learned, about an excellent customer service, about internet security (very important), co-workers are very friendly and helpful, the hardest part of the job is when you get a call from an angry customer, but the best part of it is when you get to this customer solution"

good,"For the first few months it's actually ok and I am enjoying it, however after 6 months we're having issues with our leaves and schedule since it's base on our ranking. But the best part of this job is the people around me, cause they have been supporting us."
good,"Working for Stream/Convergys was amazing in the sense that I worked as a Hardware Technician and walked customers through fixing their Xbox 360s and Xbox Ones over the phone. Learning how to fix the Xbox One before it's release was especially fun because that meant having several weeks of paid training on playing the X1 whether it be playing games or just studying the settings and go-to places in the network and on the dashboard."
good,"I worked 8 hours a day. There are so many things that I learned from the work as well as from my co-workers, such as: to conduct a phone interview with the applicants, collecting referrals from applicants and employees, I also improved my communication skills and my self-confidence. When it comes to the management they are also good and they treat their employees equal and fair and they let us know more knowledge and skills for the growth of the company. I enjoyed being part of the recruitment team and the company because they taught me to face the real world in the first step."
good,Joined as a fresher in convergys. It is good company to work. Work and Job culture is good. I have completed 5 years in convergys
good,"I was very good at this position as I am very good at selling things. I made pretty decent money, however at the time, i needed special accommodations. During the hiring process i was told they would be no problem but after training, they were unable to meet my accommodations."
good,"typical day at work would consist of motivation and hitting target, I learned how t communicate effectively with different types of customers. Management was always professional. Hardest part of the job is I would say keeping on top of sales. Most enjoyable would be helping customers and giving them what they need and want."
good,"my co-workers were so nice, new and old people. they were really fun. the hardest fun in the job was the night shift. they should have gave better teaching to their trainees."
good,"not a typical job in minacs, its comfortable to work here with productive team."
good,Listening skills improveed as well as my love for coffe. Co worker was the best cust was great management wwas strict and broke the rules
good,"Work place is nice and dynamic. I learned how to multi task and be able to operate multiple online programs, tools and applications at the same time while conversing with New York City customers over the phone. The management expects targets to be met and at times employ penalties for failing marks but the co workers are easy to work with. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the ever changing and constantly updated processes and operational programs but the most enjoyable part of the job is the camaraderie with co agents and the excitement of achieving results."
good,"Trained to help the customer with 3 to 6 Lines of business. Sometimes mandated to have an overtime for a minimum of 2 hours on top of the regular 9 hours of work. Besides the challenging work load, still manage to have a fun environment due to new found friends / co-workers whom I consider my 2nd family during holidays where-in I miss celebrating with my family."
good,convergys is one of the stable company in our country they are providing the best experienced the reason why i decided to resigned is because i can't take the wake full job.
good,This job was like a high school job it came with dramatics and friends so it wasnt to bad but at times it could be very fast pace
good,"Hardest part of job is handling different customers when we have  to handle back to back calls"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Working customer service has it's ups and downs, you get really pleasant customers where it is fun to work with but you also get those angry and abusive customers as well where you question why you still work there. Overall it is not a bad job to work with if you are looking for advancement."
good,well i learned about that working in a different environment helps me more to be active and friendly in many ways.I think ive earned a bunch of good colleagues in my life.
good,"I have had a good experience working for Convergys, but there are not many opportunities for advancement.  I enjoyed chat support but being a phone agent is much harder. The hours are good most of the time. There are often difficult customers to interact with and you often cannot resolve their issue."
good,found convergys abit boring tbh it wasnt my type of call center to work in although the coms were good it was the wages that concerned me
good,"I do love my workmates. I actually love my manager as well. He's a great guy who does good by us."
good,"I learned how to deal with other people. I enjoyed working with my colleagues. Through this company, I learned how to be responsible in different tasks given to me."
good,"Work place is good and fun loving, Shift time is also good. They gave me opportunity to learn in other domain. Co workers are helpful."
good,The work atmosphere was great the company and incentives were great however at the time it seemed as if the incentives were used to cover up the low rate of pay.
good,"A typical day day at work would be fun and interesting the opportunity to talk to different types of person it builds your character on how you deal to every person you will be talking to. Learning to adjust to the way management handles and office mates attitude is important. Learning to adhere and accept is a must. Passing metrics will be difficult at first but eventually you will get the hang of it and if you hit your metrics, you will surely reap your reward."
good,answering inboung calls take paymnts set up payment plans process orders cancel order upgrade products and services.  Other than that i really dont have much to say about convergys
good,a lots of activities. fun working here but not on my department. Satisfied with the benefits. Great company location. Nice structure of the building with a lots of recreational activities.
good,"Pay is ok. The work schedules are really flexible, if needed they will work with you.  Advancement is fast."
good,"Convergys is such a great company! It had taught me skills that I didn't know and has taught me about the importance of goal. On a daily basis, I was expected to be able to manage my own team, answer queries from my subordinates and answer emails. Management was supportive and competitive at the same time. I was able to get all the support I needed. Hardest part of the job is being able to exceed the targets since metrics, sometimes, is just difficult to achieve but the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to give your best of your abilities to reach the goal. Also, I enjoyed being able to see my agents grow their career in Convergys."
good,It had a great starting wage and great benefits. I loved working with costumers and trouble shooting tech problems. It wasn't a very challenging job and advancement was a little more difficult than expected. Enjoyed the discount employees got for the apartments across from the workplace

good,"During the past two years with Convergys, I learned that it is important that you do your job with passion as it will result to positive results."
good,Ich habe bei Concentrix fuer ein Jahr gearbeitet. Es war schoen.
good,"There was time when I received one of the most difficult calls that a specialist can receive. The customer was already upset onset of the call because he was able to receive the statement on time so he thought that he would be charged of a late fee, without him knowing that he can process a payment via telephone and the payment would be on time. I gave him the option of processing the payment over the phone so we did. He was glad that he was not late in processing the payment. I also provided him several options on how to make a payment like doing it online or setting up an automatic payment. He asked to send the payment options to his email and he will think about it. He was so happy about the service that I have provided and made him ask for a manager that he can speak with about the customer service that he experienced from me. because of that call I was given a Starbucks gift certificate worth 500 pesos for the job well done."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"As a member of Concentrix in the Washington State area you need to know three things: You pledge your loyalty to the company, you pledge your loyalty to the client, and you do what the boss says."
good,this was a very interesting and busy atmosphere the people were great workers and the teams always offered a challenge for the day such as meeting daily quotas ect. Management was always helpful and prepared ready candidates for better positions. The only bad part was this job had a high turn over rates.
good,"extremely fun and supportive team environment and I enjoy interacting within the dealer network, helping and supporting through any issues they are facing and providing info/training sessions through webex and developing and building relationships"
good,"Convergys believes in building from within. As long as you work hard, build right relationships with the people you work with and you're needed in the particular post, then you will definitely get the job you want."
good,It was Awesome place to work. Extremely supportive but not a good place if your seeking job security as there is not a lot of different companies under convergys
good,There is a lot of knowledge before you are able to start on the system. Once you get a hang of it it is pretty simple. The co-workers are friendly and lend a helping hand when needed. over all i enjoyed working at Convergy's.
good,"call flow varies, some days busy , some are slower. Constantly improving changes, friendly work environment, management is very active with employees."
good,"When I worked for Convergys, I worked for two different clients, Bank Of  America and Chrysler Corporation."
good,Training was fine. Very informative and educational. Once we were put on the floor it was a completely different environment. Coaches were hard to reach. Often had to be the go between for the customer and the client. Felt like I was lost in a forest most of the time. Ended up leaving the company due to stress and high blood pressure.
good,I had to take inbound calls to help people solve their internet connectivity issues in 10 minutes and 20 seconds. I took between 40 to 60 calls a day.
good,"Convergys is a good company to get good experience.  But for the long term most people, get the experience and move on.  I have enjoyed working for Convergys.  The learning curve for my project is very high.  I have stayed for as long as I have because of the Insurance.  That part of the job is appreciated, but for what work you do and the things you need to know, they do'nt pay enough."
good,"Great company with all the great people to work with. Given all the necessary training free stuff like souvenirs, food and incentives. The company make sure that all employee's that work hard in the office are given rewards for their consistent quality of service."
good,"My day started with breakfast in the building they had a cafeteria, we loved it. i was first a customer service representative then a was promoted to a technician. I would fix cell phones over the phone with my computer. it was exciting. We always had management on top of us to provide good customer service. In the team that I was we got along cause we were all in the bilingual team. the hardest part of my job was when I couln't fix there phone. I enjoyed talking to my customers about their problem and being able to solve it."
good,"•	Updating and maintaining a detailed record of client information. A Client based job, working in the healthcare field, dedicated to assisting callers with medical needs and insurance information such as refills, providing information and making sure members and relatives have necessary, updated, vital information regarding their medicine and the insurance policies. The job requires me to work in a call center only receiving inbound calls from members, relatives, personals reps, pharmacists, and Doctors."
good,A good and enjoyable place to work. management is always there hands on working environment is very pleasant. The most enjoyable part of the is the people.
good,"my experience at convergys shaw site is actually quite good, all of the team leaders are so kind and very productive, they respect each other even the agents."
good,"They will hire anyone that applies for the job. No professionalism from the staff and supervisors. Benifets were pretty good and the training that you got before you go on the floor live, was great."
good,Too much drama and not enough discipline. Very unorganized. Disrespectful employees towards other employees and to customers.
good,"There was opportunity for growth if the personality was a fit."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,OK place to work.  Pay not too bad. I would recommend to someone looking for an entry level position.  This is not for someone who has experience but for someone who is looking build their resume.
good,"Clock in ready to take calls and assist with a variety of technical and billing issues for a popular video game company. My job was to ask probing and clarifying questions to ensure a clear understanding of what needed to be done, then assist in solving the problem."
good,"Working for this company was fun. The management on the other hand was a little un professional in that it could be tough when it came to getting help with the job.  The people you work with are amazing, and easy to get a long with.  Turn over rate is very high.  The hardest part of the job was answering calls back to back with no time in between. Also hours were based on a bidding sytem which changed monthly."
good,"With the exception of Convergys not being a job that pays a living wage that you are able to take care of your family on, You do come across nice people that you can retain a friendship with after work hours, which is the most enjoyable part of the job. Convergys is a place of employment for young people who are students, childless and for people who need a part-time job. This isn't a job for a single parent looking for full-time work. You won't make it on the salary if you don't have a degree. The hardest part of this job is that your schedule change every four months, which is hard if you have children and no help with childcare. The company don't pay you enough for childcare and they don't work to well with you to try and accommodate your schedule if you have children. Overall, Convergys isn't a bad company to work for."
good,The moral is very low need to appreciate the employees a little more but overall an ok job lots of everyday changes love my co workers
good,"it was an over all fun job, but alot of the team leads were very unhelpful and  not to compassionate, there were a few good ones. it also seemed like a lot of the times people wouldnt receive their full compensation for all their sales like they were supposed to."
good,Took the job thinking it would get me through but 15 years later I have been able to travel to 3 different countries and seen places I never imagined.  It was not always easy but found good managers that were as committed to my success as I was.
good,"A typical day at work was answering inbound calls from customers who had issues with their service. "

good,"Nice well maintained place to work."
good,"I had the chance to meet people of different culture, a fun workplace, it gave me the chance to develop my skills in customer service. Most of all, my communication skills got even better."
good,a typical day at work would be answering question for the new hire training agents and walk around helping them with anything they might need. I learned to be patient as other people may need the extra help and have to be allot more patient. Management is ok but could be better. My co workers are awesome very friendly and nice person. The hardest part of the job is to be patient you could easy break at any time but patients is the key. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing i helped out everyone and them telling me thanks for the help.
good,"a very good schedule and atleast it would last for 4 months that it will be changed again which is ok because we can adjust in a long time.learned to get along with coworkers.the hardest part is whenever you are sick and have documents,its still hard to validate it.the most fun part is that when they give compensation to a hardwork or overtime incentives"
good,First all center job. coworkers were beautiful to work with. the hours were good hours no late night hours.  I learned a lot about benefits.
good,Working with the team leaders and fellow employees is truly enjoyable.  Upper management consists of vile and thoughtless tyrants who expect to be treated like royalty.  Truly the only draw back.
good,"This outsourcing company was responsible for several different accounts with companies for customer support. It had a great training program, and allowed flexibility of work schedule, as well as different assignments and advancement within the company."

good,"The Job Was Really Draining, and the Customers are Often Times Very Rude. The Real Plus Was the Salary, Other Than That it Kinda Sucked."
good,"Convergys is one of the best companies here in the Philippines. It offers growth for its employees with its Building from Within programs where they hire for promotion internally. Their only downside was when they purchased Stream and adapted its ""Every Other Friday Pay"" without asking opinions from their employees."
good,"Answering phone calls back to back, multitasking with multiple screens and programs running at once. Hardest part would have to be trying to get the customers to buy the products I would have to offer."

The managers and trainers there were great about constructive criticism and working with their employees to better not just one person but the entire team."
good,"Considering that this was my first company, employer and my first work ever, I would say Convergys is a good company in terms of employee engagement. I find this place fun and you can feel no discrimination in terms of heirarchy/position. Supervisors, leaders, managers are very approachable. To the point that you can throw jokes and kid around w/ them but not losing respect to each and everyone. Bonus and compensation are given to well deserved employees. Fun activities are conducted for employee to have fun and take a break from a very stressful work."
good,Mostly my time of work is on the evening till morning so I learned to be more flexible and can easily adopt to time shiftings and environment. I was able to manage my time wisely and still manage to be healthy despite of the graveyard shifts . I have met my wonderful co-workers and friends that are very helpful and thought me to be more independent. I enjoyed staying with the company because it helped my professional growth.
good,The typical day at Convergys was fairly routine. You showed up for work and started taking calls. The best part about the job was feeling like you had actually helped someone with a problem they were having. The training truly prepared you for your actual work and was more than sufficient.
good,"Overall the companay is great, there's just no stability. They have a larger turnover. Mangement is nice , and there's nothing really hard about the job, all your doing is answering and saling phones. the co- workers are great and the most enjoyable part about my job is meeting new people."
good,"A call center with multiple contracts from health insurance to cellular customer service. I worked 40 hours a week delivering customer service in the form of health insurance plans, signing customers up for the best plan that can help them in their medicl needs. Also had to adhere to government regulated guidelines and restrictions on every call, enjoyed the fast nature of this job, and also the fact that everything was confidential and sensitive giving me some sense of responsibility."
good,"Assisted in activating and creating new customer accounts "
good,i learned a lot of things about how to really work as a call center agent. i was able to learn a lot about english grammar and pronunciation and how american people is. the most enjoyable part is their salary and how their cutoff works since the cutoff is every 2 weeks. the hardest part is the account itself they have unorganized bill and tools.

I learned a lot of techniques to diffuse irate customers and how to use a knowledge base. Management was ok but they looked out for who they wanted to. Co-workers were great!! Everybody helps each other. The hardest part of the job was DSAT because you had to send everyone to the survey and your job depends heavily on that. I enjoyed the environment and co-workers."
good,"This job was ok, it was kind of unorganized."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes!

good,"I love my job and the people.  I like helping the customers and working with my team leaders to get the customers issue resolved. I like that it can be competive to earn extra movie, and to receive bonuses and win prizes.  They do reward you for your hard work and recognize your hard work.

At first it was as easy as troubleshooting the cable TV until those metrics were mandated. The hardest part of the job is when we doesn't have a quarterly set of week off's. Our Rest days are always changed every week. Which is really not agent friendly."
good,The company is pretty good or at least the department I was in about expanding. The schedule worked for me a lot better than other jobs were able to sometimes accommodate for special cricumstances. Was able to move up rather quickly while there.
good,A nice workplace to know and understand the work culture in BPO industry.
good,"Very Good company, Learned being on the management level, Great co-workers and managers. Coping with difficult customer is enjoyable"
good,"Answered phones quickly and in a nice matter, I learned to excel in customer service."
good,"This position had a high level of stress ."
good,"As a call center agent, the most important goal is giving clients satisfaction of the service they get from the company which is being executed my agents.Dealing with them in a professional way is the best wasy to handle them and provide other options if at the end I cannot be able to solve the problem rather than giving them no hope."
good,"I learned a lot from working in this company and got the opportunity to advance. Their was issues with job security. The turn over ratio was very high. Often employees would be let go for accusations without proof. The result was having to retrain new workers often. Other than that it was a great company to work for, great memories."
good,pay is good..training is too long..huge turnover rate! very easy money for young people out there
good,"Awesome benefits, pretty good pay, terrible business management!"
good,"I didn't like they way things ran within this company. The trainers were cool, and the supervisors were cool, but the contract made things difficult with the 2 companies."
good,Long shifts with 10/15 minute paid break every 2.5/3 hrs 1 hour lunch unpaid and very rude customers calling in that are not satisfied with the services and products every day is a struggle to stay positive and optimistic but with adequate breaks and prayer to destress its a great set of people to work with just the customers over the phone can bring you down. The staff and coworkers at Convergys are amazing and remind you that we will all get through it together. One call at a time one day at a time.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,They have a really bad time communicating. They overall do the things they promise. The Team Leaders are amazing but managers above them aren't so great. They honestly don't care.
good,"05/09/2012"

good,i loved working for convergys and working with a team of like minded people but at the same time i was told that i would get a different schedule and months go buy and nothing is done to change that . your stuck like chuck with what you get.
good,It was a nice place to work but pay was not good. You had the chance for advancement most of the co-workers were young so you had to deal with attitude.
good,"ON the phones taking incoming calls.  "
good,"sift duty was there, my communication skill is developed from there,  good management, co workers were help full & laborious etc."
good,"I enjoyed working at Publix, the people were nice, the co-workers were nice and overall it was an enjoyable experience. The only down fall the working for Publix was the amount of hours and the wages, they were not enough to live on its a great starting job for a teenager living with his/her parents but not for a parent trying to support a family."
good,Convergys is a great place to work. Great hours great managers and food vendors daily.
good,"Loved my coworkers, wonderful people that I worked with, very stressful otherwise. Decent benefits. Bent over backward to work with my schedule and needs."
good,Management Skills and some times extend our shifts. It is overall a great place to work and we do have cultural activities very often which  will help employees to show case there talent.
good,This job was something I had never done before and loved it challenged me each n every day. I had to quit due to mold in the work place by Doctors orders.
good,Great entry level job. A great place for learning and growing into a better person
good,I loved my job with maniacs. It was a fun and upbeat environment and I loved all my co-workers. I did not like how the management will take advantage of the employees in a bad situation
good,Its a very good organization to learn Windows. The culture us really good. We have different LOB's who have their own expertise. All LOB's work in collaboration if require.
good,I didn't mind working here. I was able to communicate with customers over the telephone and made a difference in a persons' life very slightly..That is important to me.
good,Nice place to work and good place to get the practical knowledge and implementation of various types..
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Everyday is at work is a typical day learning many things technical steps on every issue & the management to quit good & cooperate & help;s alot with the job & my career with the studies.Co-workers as in all companies, many are friendly & few are against.There is no hardest part of the job as I love the job & do it.Every moment & every issue at work is enjoyable & a best learing place"

good,Enoy working for Convergys. Lunch was provided on site. Team leaders were easy to work with
good,Assisting the customer the best way you can. Employees was great to work with.
good,"Convergys was a decent place to work."
good,Consistently exceeds sale objective-top rated sales executive call center. Communicate with customer’s one-call resolution. Trouble shooting/problem solving departmentally. Team player
good,Warm and friendly work environment. Managers and supervisors are very approachable and accomodating
good,"great people and decent work experience, great learning experience."
good,This was a complete customer service job. I learned patience and the ability to understand to the customer is upset with the situation and it is not a personal attack. Management was very team and goal oriented which drove the employees to aspire to achieve. The hardest part of the job were the days i took 70 calls rather that 35. The most enjoyable part was the recognition for my achievements.
good,"a typical day at work - take in calls for AT&T"
good,"The hardest part of the job was keeping track of surveys."
good,Over all its a good company to start with. I have learnt a lot from this job.
good,"Convergys has been a fairly decent place to work, with semi-acceptable benefits and projects. Some projects are more difficult to advance in than others."
good,At Convergys most days went more or less the same. During a normal day I'd take about 20-30 calls depending on the call volume and how long each lasted. Over the course of the job I learned alot of technical details about many of the products as well as good ways to talk to customers so as to make it easier for them. The management at the job was variable my personal team lead was good at his job but many others I had to use when he was unavailable were either inexperienced or just pointed me to information I had already seen myself. The hardest part of my job were getting repeat calls where the person's issue had remained unresolved. Many times it would be caused by hardware such as cell towers and be out of my control to fix yet they would blame me. As for the most enjoyable part I'd say it was when I'd fix a problem and the person would be really happy and grateful for it. It was really nice to feel like I'd helped someone like that.
good,"On the call center floor, it was very fast pace.  Everyone always had something to do, and we almost always worked together.  Whenever I had a problem I had valuable team mates that I could ask any questions that I had, and them to me.  The hardest part was trying to continue to sound enjoyable on the phone, because alot of customers called in about the same things, and it became repetative."
good,A normal day at the job would include power hours for sales and receive gift cards if your entry was picked. I learned more about products that were sold each day. My fellow co-workers were easy to communicate with and friendly. 
good,"A typical day at work would be helping customers with their purchases, and helping maintain the cleanliness of the store. I learned how to set up the store and good customer service skills. Management was easy to work with when I need to take time off. Co-workers were fun and easy to work with. The hardest part of the job was standing on my feet for 8 hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to talk to the customers as they checked out. "
good,Very detailed training got us prepared for the job in only two weeks. Many great team leaders and help was available most times.
good,"Arrived 7:45 Open main door with ID card run to the floor put computer on and login at 7:50 or 7:55 and start received incoming calls."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,helping providing customer service. i learned how to help other and no that customer are all right. my management was nice. the co-worker were all friendly .there wasnt any hard part ab the job. the enjoyable part was meet all the new people each day.
good,A great group of people rallying around a singular focus and goal of growth. As we are growing we have plenty of challenges that come up and anyone who is near must be flexible enough to step in and assist. 
good,I learned from agent to management more than I can write in this review. 17 years and many position taught me more than I ever expected!
good,"Assisting our phone tech support team with issues that they have either never dealt with or was having trouble with.  Assisting customers with those not so simple issues and making sure that we, as a company, are doing everything we can to ensure customer satisfaction. "
good,"Over all it was a great company to work for, meet new friends. Had fun talking with customers. Great pay and benefits."
good,taught me a lot of patience when it comes to customer care
good,A typical day at concentrix was usually fun .Everybody enjoyed the work atmosphere.people made fun and cracked jokes.
good,"Usually, in other career paths I would go to sleep dreading to have to wake up and return to a place of chaos and disorder, among other things. However my experience with Convergys was quite different. They make sure to provide training for the different positions that they offer. Rather than droning on in a boring way, the trainers make sure to encourage interaction from the trainees. By doing this it made the session interesting and the lessons learned was retained in a way that made them easier to recall when a situation arises. I've also learned how to be patient with customers in distress and irate. It was a skill that i was already proficient in but working at Convergys enhanced what was already instilled in me. Convergys also stressed having good time management, or producing positive results in a short amount of time."
good,Job was interesting. Handled incoming complaints about service and billing. Reconciled them in a competent manner to defuse anger/frustration of customers.
good,"The environment is good. Management could be better and more interactive with the workers, rather than calling them to your office if your stats aren't how he would like. The actually company are ran by Indian people who do job outsourcing for different big companies. It's not a bad place to work but, after being here over 6 months, it's time to move on."
good,I found taking tech support calls a little stressful but I handled it. The staff was friendly. And they had a lunchroom with microwaves and vending machines.
good,this place is one of the better call centers to work at in town
good,Good environment
good,Convergy's is a fun work place. They do a lot of contests and give away a lot of things. Then again it is a very hard place to work for. I had some life changing things happen and they would not work with me at all so that I could keep my job. They are very unorganized you will never get the same answer from the same person which makes it hard to know what is right and what is wrong.
good,"A typical work day is answering incoming phone calls, providing driving directions, reservations, and emergency contact as required. Management is informative and co-workers are helpful with assisting new comers with assistance in handling calls. The most difficult part of the job was the changing of work schedules. The most enjoyable part of the job was customer interaction. Customers would ask for reservations or directions to places that you have never heard of and they will tell you about their previous experiences there."
good,Opportunities for growth but not a career. Job becomes stagnant and employees are over worked and underpaid.
good,"Helping customers solve problems in a fast, friendly manner, while following client guidelines and company policys. I enjoy the enviorment of the job in the sense that it's not very physically demanding, however the management is unorganized to say the least."
good,"To answer telephones, talk to customers who want to cancel their account, and try your hardest to save them and talk them out of cancelling with different types of offers. Learned a lot about talking to people on the phone and how to probe customers to get the information I needed to talk them out of cancelling. Management and co-workers are fun and energetic people and would even spend time with them outside the workplace. The most difficult part of the job is when I can't talk customers out of cancelling because I strive to be the best and I want to save all the cust I talk to. The most enjoyable part is when you talk a customer into keeping their account. That's when you know you are trying your hardest."
good,"As a SonicWALL Sales Account Manager, I actively sold next generation network security platforms to new and existing customers, managed an installed base pipeline, provided peer coaching, and, constantly trained myself on the product to become an expert on the account. My favorite part of the job was being able to assist my teammates and share best practices with them that helped me to be successful on the account. I also enjoyed assisting customers by understanding their needs and offering products or services that were best suited for their company. The hardest part of my job was working on an account that constantly had upper management changes."
good,"A typical day is logging into all the systems by 6 am and taking calls dealing with complaints and compliments. Management is pretty decent and the co workers make the atmosphere fun and easy to enjoy. Hardest part of the day does not exist, but the most enjoyable part is knowing that im able to help others on a daily basis."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Waking up and rolling into work in your pajamas literally 5 minutes before your shift is set to begin is a wonderful thing. You dont have to worry about someone taking your seat, the environment is always a comfortable temperature, no lines for the bathroom, and no 'wear-n-tear' on your car! Initially sounded like the best thing around, and for what it was worth, it is definitely a great experience... it's just not for me."
good,"I worked in the customer service department taking inbound/outbound calls for a client concerning there health care, I enjoyed my job a great deal and I left for a better job that would expand my knowledge within a field."
good,Convergys is a great place to work with providing you with a Stable and a secured job. There has been a substancial growth in the year 2011 with new processes coming in.
good,"Customer Call Center that focuses on sales, very team oriented, very diverse and accepting workplace, relaxed professional atmosphere, good management team"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Convergys. You work hard when you're working, but once your time is up for the day, you can definitely leave your day at the workplace. The pay is competitive with other call centers and their benefits packages are really good."
good,"The people that I work with are a great group to work with. "
good,It had only just changed to Concentrix not long before I left. It was under Convergys. My role was a Sales Advisor which did lead to me moving up to a Senior Advisor. The Call Centre was making redundancies and the Call Centre was closing down which lead me to looking for a new place to work.
good,"PROS"
good,"Good place to work, you will get a lot of things to learn.some time you have to work in pressure but it will help us to build our organising skills. Best thing about concentrix is that they provide you lot of different opportunities with in the organization."
good,"There are incentives for program specific."
good,"Convergys is a good place to work at. The people there is very fun and "
good,"There's no confidentiality if you have any concerns and address them,depends on process.the main thing is the salary only.               .           ."
good,"First job is everything, learned a lot and is still learning until today."
good,Acredito que a empresa da boa oportunidades de crescimento a seus funcionários.
good,I was working with a firm were we had less exposure of international as well as we had more customer interaction then less management interaction as we BPO is polluted and there is ok working with concentrix
good,I liked making new friends and exposure to different business units.Shifting schedule was challenging but the benefits compensated for it.They provided opportunity for Career growth.
good,Working with my previous company is okay. The job is fun however the environment sometimes can be toxic. overall satisfied. Compensation wise is okay.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,It's an ok job but not something you can make a career out of. Good for those that are looking for their first job. It was just a job with no advancement of position.
good,Work environment is good but break time adherence are very strict. Salary increment is ok. No promotions or career growth in company. Rotational shift and one fix week off on Sunday and other is alternative in week
good,"Concentrix or Convergys must improved on the culture of their management team where politics and bureaucracy and favoritism is rampant but in terms of salary, concentrix has it."
good,"I enjoy the company in terms of the friends that I have made there but in terms of progression, it is a bit misleading as there a numerous targets to be met before even being considered"
good,"I liked working there , the call center floor was always exciting. management was both good and bad but in the end it worked with me. I really liked the music they played while we were on calls. It improved my mood immediately."
good,"I've been with Concentrix for 5 years. Good benefits with ""so-so"" salary if you work in back office. I can say that the company is financially stable."
good,The organisation is good with managers who were always ready to blend in even with the executives. The organisation had a good blend of people to interact with.
good,Management is friendly and supportive even if a little unorganized at times. Quick to respond to potential issues you are having. Co workers in general are pretty friendly as well.
good,Company is good and my experience with this company also very  good. Comany's staff was very supportive and environment was also enjoyable and free and learnable.
good,"Concentrix's environment is a bit lackluster for me"
good,"I love the part time option. Management could use some work. They make you move up though and it should be optional. Even though I had great metrics, I still got bad schedules. It a whi u know company in a way"
good,"Great company to work with but the salary is so low its hardly worth it. "
good,"I was employed as a T2 help-desk associate and during the 4 years employed there the only raise I was given was with change in position and when the company swapped higher insurance for the lower wage, so basically all it did was changed the income/insurance ratio because the insurance deductions were just as much as the income increase and incurred higher copay."
good,ver competitive at times...high energy and fun place to work. needs some work on training for upgraded systems with phone cues and PC advancements....
good,"I miss that place and recently re interviewed and thought I got the job, but nope! I loved the training and even fellow coworkers truly cared about your success."
good,"the environment was really cool, nothing too serious, benefits were okay, potlucks, lots of assistance, plenty of chances , highly recommend as a beginning job for customer service"
good,"Usual day at work involves coming an hour early to start up your tools and be sure to get a seat for your self as it is a little cramped during shift change."

good,They had a cafeteria and a game room with vending machines. My friends and I usually went and played pool downstairs while on lunch. The meals were also very good downstairs.
good,"I was hired on  SEASONAL POSITION with high expectations to become permanent, for you are told they hire 90% of temps. to permanent. This was a work from home position and the online communication and set up is wonderful, after the first day of training I was feeling great about the job, excited to learn more. For the next 3 straight 8 hour days, our 2 team leads were still helping the same 3 or 4 people with their username/password problems. So, come time to go on the phones I was confused about many things and they basically told us you'll figure it out as you take more calls. This didn't happen for me, and I am a quick learner, I about begged to be taken off that project and to just wait for the next and they just made me feel some type of way, unprofessional, which I am not. "
good,"very exciting, very competitive, plenty of room for growth, also very structured, requires lots of discipline. Good benefits, bonuses, and incentives."
good,The problem that I am having his that I would like to promote my job to something higher than what I am now in a different state I'm having a hard time figuring out how to transfer my job position and I think that though they do advance people's positions here they show favoritism to who they do promote over somebody else who might be more qualified
good,"Depending on the account that you are assigned to, the work environment can be chill or toxic,  Work-Life balance is an opportunity but it makes it up with engagement activities in the office.  There are a lot of leadership skills that I have learned during my stay there that enabled me to develop my skill set in coaching and in managing a team."
good,I’ve worked at concentrix for just about two years and have left to take up another opportunity concentrix are a good complany to work for if you enjoy a happy environment and a management team who do there best to allow you to enjoy work.

good,"Great job to be able to work from home,"
good,"After working with Concentrix for 7 years, I was able to significantly move up in my roles.  I started as an advisor and left as a training manager of a 300 seat call center.  It was a great place to learn and grow as a professional.  I was able to quickly gain the skills I needed to move to roles with increasing responsibility.  I would go back in a heartbeat for the right position."
good,"môi trường làm việc thân thiện hòa đồng , năng động "
good,I was very happy with the company until a year and 3 months later when they ended my contract with a company that I did very well in. I was then moved into a new contract with a week of poor training where i was then fired 3 weeks later due to not meeting the metrics for the contract.
good,"Pay is good, you can move up, but its a very in the click place/who you know. The insurance & benefits are good. As long as you don't mind not seeing your family a lot in the beginning, its a good place to work."
good,A empresa tem uma grande diversificação entre funcionários e isso é muito importante nos dias de hoje!
good,"The culture is very different today, since the company was purchased by another company. I know people who work at the current company and are much happier there. I don't think it's fair to comment on the company or culture from the time I worked there."
good,Worked with many people and a diverse customer base. I was able to learn a lot of technology and this job set the bar for any customer service related employment in the future.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes!

good,"DAYSHIFT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
good,"inbound/outbound calls to customers"
good,"After my time at Convergys I would say that it's a great place to work to gain customer service experience. The managers will help guide you and in order to advance you must be able to prove your worth to the company as well as have an tremendous amount of patience. During my time there, I gained a plethora of knowledge as far as the customer service experience goes."
good,"Everyday, 8 hours of your work will be taking phone calls wherein you'll be assisting different customer with regards to their services like phone, internet or tv service. You'll not just assisting them but assist them with empathy where you're putting yourself in their shoes."

good,Easy work atmosphere. Very helpful management. They try to make it fun. Learn a lot about Apple products. Located by a lot of places to eat. Very diversified staffing.
good,You troubleshoot alot of problems depending on the company you are assigned to. There are 4 companies that they provide Customer Service for. The company is a good stable company to work for.
good,"I'm currently on a temp project, I like the project I'm working on. My co-workers and team leaders are awesome. Scheduling is very disorganized. As long as you stay focused on what your work responsibility is and do your job you would not have any issues. Try not to make friends that lead to out-of-work friendships. Sometimes it feels like I'm in high school, its tons of young people that work there. There is a dress code but it's not enforced. The hardest part of the job is adhering to the conflicting and changing work schedule. The most enjoyable part is having team leaders that understand you and willing to listen in regards to any concerns you may have and actively correct it."
good,"Everyday at the job , consist of handling customers trouble calls. I learned how to DE-escalate customers to ensure they got the help they needed. Management stayed busy and was very helpful, with a group chat for help or questions that I or my team didn't know. The hardest part was sittin one spot or long periods of time , I solved this issue by standing. Most enjoyable was being able to work with a team and getting different inputs on how to handle the situation."
good,Concentrix is a very clean and well organized workplace. I've learned the most from the customers I work with throughout the day. Management is supportive and there to help. The culture is millennial and still professional. The hardest part of the job is being on time. But the most enjoyable part is being able to help customers resolve real problems.
good,"I worked at home so it wasn't like working in  the call center."
good,The account is very challenging yet peopke you get to work with are intellectual people. The job is very interesting as you will get to challenge yourself everyday with change being constant along with account updates. Your skills on multitasking mostly is also going to be tested which adds a taste and flavor to the job.
good,"It is a very good company with good management and having a lot of good environment,frendly nature, salary on time, bt have rotational shifts which caused diffcult to manage your personal life."
good,"Working in a BPO Industry can be stressful. You need to have a great management skills for you to last long in the company. "
good,"Convergys was a oppurtunity I was blessed with at the time, I would recommend but I also wouldn’t. In a way convergys caused unwanted pressure and stress."
good,The company was only available for a short period of time since another company came in and took their place. I think they could have provided a better place to work for if given the opportunity. The business was more open to what was going on with the company and where it was headed. The hardest part of the job was they did not employee as many people as they needed to perform the amount of calls that were coming in but they did hire better people to perform in the call center. Management was kept in place but were still a pick by who you knew type position. I had worked in call center business so I was familiar with the operations in a call center.
good,"This job was very stressful. I worked on the DirecTV side and its competitive and could be overwhelming some days. There was mandatory overtime because they go through employees so much because it really is a difficult job. The tasks themselves aren't very difficult but having to do deal with many of the customers who call in whose goals seem to be to make you as miserable as possible. I got death threats, insults and screams every single day. This job did teach me that people take tv way too seriously and I also know how to talk down scary people."
good,Easy place to work and blend in with the crowd. Not a lot of questions asked if you worked and went home. Pretty easy to pick up extra hours if needed and wanted.
good,"working in this company is good"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Fast paced work environment, with top of the line training. Pay is decent and shifts are really flexible. Would definitely reccomend to friends or family."
good,"Answering inbound phone calls, assisting customers with their questions of products and numerous services, taking notes while multi tasking through multiple screens. I received much experience in a short time in customer service field as a call center representative. Some calls required much more assistance than others and would be frustrating at times. The experience received was very helpful."
good,Every day we had goals to reach as well as longer term goals.  We met every day for a huddle and discussed the overall performance and how we could improved our stats.  The Supervisors always tried to make sure each person had an accurate picture strength and weaknesses and how to improve every week to get better with stats. They did a very good job.
good,"Typical day at work involves answering calls and emails, attending to meetings and providing customer service. I learned to be more flexible, more patient and how to properly build good customer relation."
good,"good team building "
good,"Convergys is a good company to start at, it offers plenty of opportunity for advancement, benefits which you qualify for after your first 90 days, a stay bonus, incentives, etc. There are opportunities for management and a more professional environment overall but the job is what you make it and can be either a very good stepping stone or a career."
good,"- Great place to work! "
good,"Great place to start working and take advantage of opportunities that are out there, of course you have to be willing to be prepared and hot and get that opportunity cus nobody will ever just hand it to you."
good,"A typical day at Convergys was you come in, work and leave. the other employees were nice and so were the managers. Overall atmosphere was a beat bleak however considering employees were not allowed contact with the outside world while on the floor."
good,"No political issue, people see you equally regardless of your position. Everyone is friendly plus the company offers a stress-free place. Clean facilities."
good,The TDM was a phenomenal manager and was the sole reason I was there as long as I was. Other than that the culture and job was that of any other call center.
good,It has been enjoyable working with Stream. Sometimes you're faced with tough and difficult customers and sometimes easy ones. The day will not go by without some fun on the sideline as the team sees to it that we will not have a boring or dreadful shift.
good,"Its been 4 years 8 month working with the largest companies in india for service sector , concentrix has given me the best exposure in my life , lot of learning but you need to learn work life balance . Its really poor"
good,"Convergys offers great security. The only reason I no longer work there is because of the supervisors. When an advocate needed help with paying off a device the supervisors were barely helpful, and the floor support isn't any help."
good,"1 of the best BPO companies in Bacolod. I'll never forget the friends I met there. The building, the physical work environment is fine, I wish they added sleeping quarters though."
good,"Convergys has a professional atmosphere. Training wise, Convergys is one of the best. Training will definitely shape up any employee, may they be new to the industry or not."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Pude aprender diferentes programas que se manejan en un call center, ademas de las tecnicas para hablar con el cliente y que la llamada no sea aburrida pero sobre todo hacer que el cliente se emocione al saber mas de los productos."
good,"This was a fast-paced customer service based company.  I thoroughly enjoyed working for this company, not to mention all of the free items we would get based on sales.  The managers and teams made it very enjoyable."
good,"It's a call centre so what can you expect? Target oriented but if you want to make money, this is the place to be. Paid over time and rewards that will fill you heart and your pocket."
good,"My experience was awesome "
good,This was my first job. I was an undergraduate back then so I wasn’t really expecting anything. Life in Convergys was trying at first but my nesting period was made easier because of the people. The people and the culture in the workplace are good. I had to leave to finish my studies but I would recommend Convergys in a heartbeat. Fun times indeed.
good,I joined as a customer service executive For the process AXIS which deals with different loans of a customers. I worked for a voice process where in we clear queries of the customers through call.
good,"While everybody is taking calls, there are assigned groups that will entertain us on the floor such as dancing, giving snacks. The Team Leaders are fun"
good,Enjoyed my job with Convergys. I feel the leadership could have been better. Training should consist more soft skills and longer on computer skills to better enhance new employees experience.
good,"The job is fast paced and stressful. Take 60+ calls a day. I did not like the heavy emphasis on sale, as I felt like I had to lie in order to get sales quotas met. People calling in for technical support are generally not in the mood to buy more products from a company."
good,Convergys was a good place to work the pay was great. But it is vert easy to get burned out on the work. Specially when mandetory over time was tacked on to your schedule. Management was okay the coworkers where there to work and provided a good escape to an otherwise bleek Environment.
good,Convergys is a very great place to work at as the job is very easy going. The wage is not very good but is not as bad as other companies. The staff and colleagues are very nice and friendly
good,I always looked forward everyday to work and talk to the customers.  I learned how to deal with people and to take care of their needs as far as their services.  It was hard sometimes to deal with their emotions when customers don't get what they expected.  But had to stick with what is offered within their accounts or what they could qualify for.
good,My position is a work-at-home job but the training and work is not what I was expecting. I would prefer a slower process to help absorb the work I am doing.
good,Employees are not aware of policies nd no job security employees are taken out at any point without any excuse. Managers are supportive to their Dr's nd colouges
good,"It was a job it paid the bills. the employees made the time there fun, and enjoyable. It was late hour shifts at times. They had their own little snack store there as well which was amazing it closed at 8pm but it was awesome they had one."
good,"Laid back position , friendly staff, help was there if you found yourself needing some fine tuning on particular subjects or topics that you were falling short in."
good,"You make the best out of the  opportunity you are given.  Lots of room for growth, you just need to put in the time and effort."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Convergys is the best place to start advancing your career in enterprise level environment. management extra procedures some time distract you but if you remain focused on your job you will enjoy it!
good,"Convergys probably isn't a bad place to work for, I think the problem at my location is the client. The point system that convergys does needs to be taken away, it's not the greatest."
good,Converygs is a good place to work full of good people not the best wage and when you do hit bonus there a lot of reasons to have thst bonus took off you
good,Concentrix is a good company to work for.  Agents are very helpful one to another. Everyone works as a team. Team Leads are always there to help everyone succeed.
good,Uma das melhores experiências que tive até então. Fui muito bem recebido e a empresa e tive ótimas oportunidades de me desenvolver e buscar crescimento.
good,nyc conpany provide no life balance but still its ok try to improve....they train you well and policies are nice but keeps on changing.....rest is ok ok
good,"Fun place to work teams that competed with one another. Bonuses monthly which was sometimes more than my bi weekly pay. Met daily goals and quota often exceeding my expectations,"
good,It's important to understand that the quality and environment of the work has everything to do with the contract and client it's being supported. I've been on contracts that were disappointing and have been on contracts that were exemplary.
good,Learned a lot of information concerning the Surface device and Windows 10. Really enjoyed the management and training. All support was closed down in the US. Pay was very low with no incentives. Loved the daily routines and the feeling of satisfaction when resolving technical problems.
good,"Good place to work for if you are very self motivated, as it's very unlikely you will end up with a manager that does their job well enough to spare time to help develop you. My most recent role, i spent a lot of time justifying my role to people, and battling others to do their own jobs. If you work in operations things can be better, you get to hold people accountable and move the needle. If you work support staff you'll have to battle getting operations on your side. There are a few good managers out there that understand what each role brings to the team, but if you end up with someone who lacks vision, you'll be in a constant battle to keep them on a good path.  It's really random what type of team you'll be working on as the culture is about producing results, with process consistency coming second. Which is a shame because the process's they have are really good, how they teach you to coach agents, and the tools available are really positive, but many managers utilize them poorly. They are their own worst enemies."
good,"Hardest part of the job: the customers"
good,"Good corporate culture. Company was truly focused on providing excellent customer service, and exceeding customers expectations. Company was very helpful when I was off for a serious health problem."
good,High call volume but and easy and supportive workplace. Right off the highway. If you don't mind coming to work and doing the same easy tasks everyday this is s good job for you.
good,Convergys has provided me a lot of opportunities. I've learned a lot from my leaders and mentors. It has a diverse culture of learning and growing. They develop all of their employees to be leaders.
good,"buena empresa  diferentes cuentas  , personas buenas y trabajadoras"
good,"Worked in convergys India for 8 months, it provided me an opportunity to work and a good knowledge. I learned a lot about management and handling call. Time to time there were many appraisals and my work was appreciated."
good,"Good transport facility, friendly environment, helpful management. The environment is very competitive but easy to go no work pressure to exhaust your mind. It should work on employees upskilling aswell, not employee centric"
good,"Just a brief review with some nice points here, take it with a grain of salt either way as it's my own opinion."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"It was a good starter position, but the compensation is much less than other call centers. There is a very high turnover rate  because of this. Most use it for initial experience, then move on."
good,Would train incoming employees of the systems and products. After a four week training would transition into a two week on the job training on the phones to help better them on the phones
good,I believe this company is good for newbies to start their careers. They have good training managers and nesting programs that focuses on each trainees.
good,"Une entreprise permettant vraiment un épanouissement, l'ont découvre le milieu de l'entreprise assez agréablement, on s'y épanouie également, la hiérarchie porte sa confiance en vous, maintenant les conjonctures économique mondiale avec une concurrence rude rende le travail ardu par moment, cependant une équipe agréable est là pour vous aider en cas de besoin. Les horaires peuvent parfois êtres source de contrainte mais encore une fois une équipe à l'écoute de chacun."
good,I did have a great time learning new knowledge and experiences at work. The limited time for training gives me a hard time adjust because it was my first job.
good,This is one of the best company in the corporate world. There is a good environment. Company taking care of employees they provide best security and also they provide more opportunity to learn and develop our skills & experience. Very good scope is there in future.
good,"This was my first company and one of the best fun workplace. Great management, great friends. The hardest part of the job is assisting rude customers and the most enjoyable part would be the team buildings and bonding with colleagues."
good,Take calls at call center and have learned alot of information in health insurance. Busy circumstances at times but enjoyable parts of the workplace is being able to help others.
good,"The company itself was good. The experience you will have depends on the management and how they operate in your department. In my case, the promotion and advancement in career will take a while. Our managers during that time are friendly and approachable."
good,"This company is where I started my career, even tho I dont have an experience before they gave me a chance. This company accepts fresh graduates and they will give you enough salary."
good,"Taking calls constantly was stressful and the pay did not accurately reflect the job or what it required."
good,My previous company provided me a good opportunity with regards to enhancing me skills. I had so much fun working with my colleagues and doing such extra activities on my company
good,Big company no room for growth. I had to resigh cause i can see myself in the same spot for a very long time. Management is great. Human Resources is easy to approach.
good,"It was a great experience working in this company, I was able to developed my skills to a certain stretch and I was able to manage and identify the strengths I have in delivering a customer service experience that would set a bar."
good,Concentrix is a good company to work in but don't expect promotion so easily !! Even if you're top performer on the floor then too you have to stick for atlease 2.5-3.5  Years to get an opportunity !! What I would suggest is to move on after 6 months !!
good,Working with convergys before was exciting and fun environment though it's really a busy kind of job but it's just fine since the people around you was funny and willing to help you when you need help about the job.
good,"The hardest part of working in a BPO industry as Recruiter is not being able to get everyone a job. Also, this industry requires you to work fast, and you need to get everything done in just short span of time. On a lighter note, it so much fun to work with Operations and Clients -- I love the fact that you are helping the company earn a revenue."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Good place to start your career as fresher."
good,"Decent job for a fast learner and they have great benefits plus room for advancement "
good,"Loads of emails and calls, follow ups with customers for activation of plans. Learned how to deal with customers over the phone and about networks. The company has great environment with gyms, table tennis and pool tables to refresh your self in free time. Hardest part is when you have back to back calls but then the you also realize how quickly the time passes."
good,"Excellent working atmosphere and the members of the institution was very supportive and motivating, I overall had a great experience in the company but is disatisfied as my process(idea service+) got shutdown all of a sudden and they failed to ensure me a job in a different process."
good,"Great management but low salary. Awesome people and they are very easy to be with.  The workplace also was very friendly. However,  sometimes pressure will sucks you even in to your nerves."
good,"Educational and excellent training ,  Overtime optional gives you a chance to make more money.   Work with a lot of nice people in the community and aslo selling a great product which is Directv."
good,"Convergys is a decent place to work, you're in the AC all day just talking to people. If you can talk nicely to people over the phone, keep your cool, and just remember basic info its the job for you. I have worked here for 5 months now with no call center experience and I have to say its one of the better jobs I've had. The pay isn't awful you accrue PTO as soon as you start and everyone is generally pretty nice. Unlimited optional OT as well."
good,I had fun working there and was able to progress quickly! Although I did not make anything extra for training service reps. I did enjoy the job and customer calls.
good,"It's a tough job depending on which contract you work on. The people around you are what makes or breaks it. Most people don't make it a long term career, but if you play your cards right you can gain some very valuable work experience in more than just taking calls. If you ask for development and you're a good employee, you'll get it (although it may not turn into a promotion)."
good,Convergys is no longer in Cedar City and there were some agents that went to work from home. The work from home atmosphere is not as easy because the supervisors are extremely critical.
good,The job had many pay incentives and raises. The were many opportunities for overtime. It was always  interesting customer called from all over the world.  The company was a nice place to work until it closed down in Baton Rouge.
good,"This job allowed me to grow as a person. They always encouraged us team leaders to woke with our teams. This help learn more about time, this will help me for life."
good,"I enjoyed working for convergys, very great place to build your money up. The was very understanding when it comes to life emergencies. Training was great!!!"
good,"Working with Convergys was definitely a life changing job. I have to thanks Convergys for giving me the opportunity to learn everything and anything relayed to computers."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Good place to work and excel yourself. No problem in working. Working hours has increased but salary has not.. As it has capping which is not good for people who work hard.
good,You get to learn from your mistakes on the set of the call and when another call comes up you are already aware of the mistakes you had on the previous call. So get to handle the call faster and more efficiently  making the subscribers happy and satisfied.
good,"It was a learning field and a batllefield. I had a wonderful experience working with everyone, every people I encountered inside and outside of the work place."
good,It's nice company for work. But now it's not  employee friendly company.  The best part of this company is transportation. I really enjoyed to work with convergys.
good,Convergys was a very competitive and stressful workplace since it was a very rigorous job with many tasks to fulfill. The managers are always in contact with their team overseeing that the workers do an excellent job assisting the consumer. There was a lot of socializing between the employees and we got along like a family. The company had raffles to reward the workers with gifts. In special occasions the meals were offered for free.
good,"Really not much to say, I liked working here. Everyone was nice, and the company culture was relaxed and supportive. I just wish they paid a more competitive salary."
good,"Convergys is  a semi stressful job. Customers having problems with business and personal orders can get out of HAND. Its a nice place to work and for career advancement, and would definitely recommend for anyone to work with them."
good,"Very nice people to work with. Work was fairly slow-paced, however. Management was lax most of the time. Work hours were strict and had to be fulfilled."
good,"It's was easy money but stressful , good community. Floor support was good at the time time not because they would make the customers wait when they would tell us not to."
good,"servicio al cliente en español, inglés. horarios fijos pero se pueden cambiar dependiendo de la necesidad. posibilidad de bonos por desempeño"
good,"I worked graveyard shift at Convergys but I never complained because I'd rather stay late at night than to woke up early in the morning. I've learned a lot from this company because it made me a better person, confident in facing different kinds of people and most of all I value customer. I never had issues when it comes to sales because I am always good at it because I mastered our products very well."
good,This company is my first call center experience. I learned a lot of things in handling stress more effectively. It helped me improve my interpersonal skill and talking to people professionally. This company gives me satisfaction when it comes to benefits and incentives. It is highly-cultured and peaceful environment. People are nice and very friendly. They know how to give their people recognitions.
good,Company wanted to diversify and they hired me to grow the new channel. However they lost so much market share they could not fund the business. It would have been great
good,"There are metrics that must be met to retain your employment, training given. Attendance policy is on a point system and strictly enforced. There are many perks you the company"
good,"took payments over the phone for comcast cable service, answered billing problems. was a very competitive, high paced and stressful job. enjoyed the work, but needed more time to train"
good,"Phone calls to numerous businesses"
good,"I really enjoyed working here, i learned a lot about customer service here. Everyone was amazing at training me and gave me great confidence heading into my next customer service job."
good,I opened cases for customers when they called in asking for assistance with repair costs. As a Team Leader I had agents  that reported directly to me.
good,"good work life balance, better co-worker. Enjoyable workplace, Hardest part of my job is my job and my manager. I learned that do your best every time because someone wanted you job too."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,the management try to make it fun and upbeat but it is a very stressful job. you are expected to meet certain sales goals and if you don't then you will have a hard time no matter how good your customer service skills are.
good,"The company has opportunities to advance, there is a lot of change but not many opportunities to grow financially. The pay is the number one reasons agents leave."
good,"Overall it is not that bad of a place to work, however when I was there the scheduling needed some improvement. My manager was awesome he was very approachable, and there was a little bit of room for advancement if you pushed yourself hard enough."
good,Awesome experience for being a part of this organisation. Lot of options to learn along with work. Opportunity to grow depending on your experience and performance
good,"Working with Convergys had made me a better leader, however due to the lack in contract accountability, many people lose their jobs in this place. I had a great time until another project came in, replaced previous and left many employees without an option, it was either look for something else or change schedules, cut in pay. etc."
good,Work is on a shifting schedule and as always in the evening. We cater to UK customers. What I  have learned in this company is valuing work. We are given all the trainings needed to enhance development. The hardest part of the job is how to really keep up with the customers needs. The most enjoyable part of the job is being one family.
good,It was a pleasure to work with the organisation . Good management and  total job security fun working environment . There is also good growth in the organisation.
good,"I loved how this company worked with you in any situation. I learned a lot about food preservation, proper preparation, and how to read expiration dates. the bonus was being able to trace the manufacture if their was a problem with the food and solving the issue."
good,It is a good company for people who aims to have a job and at the same time do other things such schooling or a full time work. It provides a happy environment for all the employees.
good,"* high call volume "
good,"The account itself is toxic, after a few months working, it will make you question why you wake up n go to work everyday. The management however will raise their voices and may scream at you, but at the end of the day, they make sure you have more than enough motivation to wake up and go back to work the next day. The management here has the biggest hearts."
good,"Latest company that where i am currently employed managers ,human resource management and deputy .managers will treat you like family.Very competitive"
good,Concentrix is good place to work but there is no job security in this company and their performance appraisal scheme is not very attractive. However company provides cab facilties which is very helpful for their employees.
good,Good working environment which will help you enhance your skills. Co-workers also help you in times of help. The most enjoyable part of being in this company is their benefits.
good,"I had not worked there for a long duration but still what i felt is,"
good,The job is really simple and it is a fun environment. There are a lot of inter office politics that go on behind the scenes and there is a lot of gossiping that effects workers and their families.
good,"My Review is limited strictly to my Process, I have no much idea about the other process in Concentrix."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"After realizing we weren't going to be selling cheese of any kind or quantity, I quickly adapted and got behind the idea of being a Customer Service Agent for a large cellphone company. The trainer was awesome, she did an excellent job training us the best she could (That was easy!). After training we were put on the floor where, if at any time we had a question, there were many people working floor support all we had to do is flag em down and they were right there to help! The customers were fine with being put on hold so much. I fancied myself the ""Dirty Harry"" of customer service and you're allowed to decorate your workspace. I had an open hand on a spring that said  ""Fees"" on it and called myself the Fee Waiver. I'm a contractor now though. All in all a great place to work!"
good,"The job can be stressful because you are dealing with angry customers all day but the coworkers that I've had are very nice and very understanding. And on certain days, a mexican restaurant would come in and serve us!"
good,confidential agreement in place cannot divulge information it is a good place to work flexibility in work scheduling sometimes need to work on stat holidays.
good,"Less that 8 months of working but its worth it. It gives you a good understanding of the tasks, responsibilities and skills involved in customer service work. We Interact with customers. Process information in response to inquiries, concerns and requests about products and services for customer satisfaction."
good,Not much to say. Easy employment. Management needs improvement. Work environment is in need of improvements. Advancement opportunities are available. Keep to yourself and go home!
good,"the people really make the environment and the inadequate training an rude customers make it stressful, management can be poor but most are hired from within if you're looking for that"
good,"As a tips would like to say best in accomplishing ourself if you want to be. Just because this company give best accommodations, good environment. Best to start your life as if u want kick up your life"
good,I would probably say that I have had the most enjoyable stint when I became part of the pioneer batch for one of their accounts. I was able to meet new friends that share the same passion as I do.
good,"Ive worked in Sutherland for almost 2 years and it's the worst employer ever. We're required to work for 10 hours everyday and they are not allowing us to have leaves which is our right. However, in convergys, they have better working environment and compensation."
good,"Answering phones/chats, helping customers. Fast paced job. Management is there to help if you have any questions. PCI friendly company. I've worked here 7 years and only thought it would be temporary."
good,"Day to day answering calls and assisting customers. People here are friendly. I've spent 7 years here when I thought it would be temporary."
good,Overall good but sometimes the things are not so smooth depending on the process. The work environment was good enough thanks to the team members. The cafeteria is also hygienic and good. A bit of concern regarding the transport department
good,"The job role itself is standard however the way the place is at higher level makes it difficult to stay long term, there seems to be very little communication between higher management and staff."
good,Convergys is a good place to work. They provided me a job when I first came to Tennessee and I have been there for 5 years. Employees should feel like they are appreciated more.
good,Productive and fun workplace.I love the BPO industry.The perks and benefits available.I like the fast-paced working environment.I like the career path it is offering.
good,"Great company to work for.  If you want to advance in your career, this is the place to work.  People are great and it is a good working environment.  Good work balance"
good,Ive learned a lot. My critical thingking has molded even better due to everyday work loads. Convergys lead me to discover my full potential as a employee.
good,"I joined 2 years back as an doc checker and got opportunity to learn other products like payments, finance, claim reimbursement . Learnt many things in finance what are bank line, limits, settlement, eibor rate. Nice experience and learning."
good,It's a good place to work with complete professionalism. I have learned so much from concentrix which definitely going to help me in achieving my next goal.
good,Itis a fun place to work beacuse of your colleagues. Will definitely give career opportunities and advancement. Nice incentives and benefits. Have an opportunity to meet new people.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Management styles needs to be re-evaluated. Several instances where management and human resources did not know how to help someone perform daily duties needed to excel in daily job.
good,"Being a manager means handling all types of agents.Its a pride to see that I was able to promote people through motivation  and encouragement. Its a challenge but it you would be able to see that you are part of their accomplishments, then its all worth it. Been with the Call Center Industry for almost 12 years already provides me all the tools and skills that I need to motivate people,"
good,Salary and benefits from Convergys were enough for the employees to receive. We never experienced disputes regarding our pay and they always make sure that they include all of the computations on our payslips.
good,"Good working environment, met a lot of friends and has career advancement. I love the incentive bonus. Must increase the basic salary and compensate well tenured employees."
good,"Convergys's leading presence in the BPO industry conveys stability. It is easily ranked as one of the top 3 call centers in the Philippines. Work hours can be any shift of 9 hours. I've learned how to manage performance, coach effectively, and facilitate engagingly at Convergys. The workplace culture in our program is customer-centric. Everything we do is for the customer. The hardest part of the job is achieving a work-life balance. Sometimes, jobs require you to work long hours - up to 12 hours! But the most enjoyable part of the job is how the company takes care of its employees. Employee engagement is a top priority."
good,I had an awsome and great experiencn with Convergys. I worked as a TSR for almost 2 years and it's been great! I had supportive superiors ang workmates and one of the best things during my stay with the company is it just a 10-15 minutes travel time going to work.
good,Can be helpful to balance work life with social and there is room for promotion as well as picking up some valuable skills and experiences but the work is very repetitive and becomes boring very quickly.
good,"It is a Great company to work for, I just wish they had a wide variety of schedules. Also the pay is not worth the job they want you to do. I also wish there was an easier way to earn back Attendance points."
good,my workmates in covergys are the best. but the workload is sometimes too much for me. got sick because of the time of work.the management is good and considerate
good,"All I can say is that, this co. has an amazing Job Culture. Apart from that provides good exposure to employees in term of promotions to Management functions. As this is a BPO, employees are required to work in shifts and shifts work are not preferred by all."
good,i learned how to communicate with peoples and how work within the group. how to respect for our senior employees.we have to work along with our team inbetween we ask some decision to other employee for getting more idea about the work
good,the people make the things we do as a staff worth while.  The part I like the most is when an agent light bulb goes of and they finally get it.  This is the reason I love training .
good,"Handling customers issues "
good,"It was great working at Concentrix. Loved the environment and good place to start a career. Good management and friendly colleagues."
good,"Day shift so it's great!"
good,"Management doesnt have any interactions with their employee's thats why most of your tenured agents were going out already of the company. Incentives are not competitive, even salary is not as well. Facility wise, very comfortable."
good,"Concentrix was a mediocre job. I have advice for anyone working in one of the tech support positions. Train yourself! Practice on your own. Do you want to be promoted? You're going to have to practice in your own spare time. Spend time learning how to use the device that you're providing support. Go to the device's website and study hard!!! Training someone over a webcam is not enough! Trust me, you're going to have to train yourself. Managers make the real money."
good,took calls and upgraded ch to earn incentives and more pay by selling the items to ch. calls were busy yet very manageable and easy due to repeating the same thing
good,As I worked for two year I learned a lot here as how to work with a new team and process and team work is always good for any organisation. I enjoyed my time in concentrix and really thankful to provide me a plate form to standup and feel confident but as I think that changes are necessary for every one to grow personally and economically as well that's why I looking for a change.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"No one was as serious as I thought this job would require, little management, and support, only good thing was the training. People who worked there were disrespectful towards the members, and the systems were the worst and always out of date."
good,"This was my first call center job, and it definitely helped me to move on to bigger and better things. Convergys was vital to my success moving forward"
good,It is ok place to work if you are single with no one else in your life...the pay is good...but the company kinda control your life...they add extra required time in your shift as well as reduce your lunch by 30 minutes without notice. It's stressful because of you are not meeting metrics then your job is in jeopardy...
good,I was in the training class when I came down with a case of vertigo and had to resign. I liked what we were doing but didn't really get a chance to do it with live customers.
good,Typical day at work consisted of Customer Service at the call center. Decent work environment. most enjoyable part of the job was the great scheduling.
good,I have worked with some fantastic people and got help when. Ended when I first started.  My managers have also been fantastic balancing the client and staff well.
good,"Call centers can be very stressful, the management and supervisory staff at Concentrix Bremerton were awesome. They made work enjoyable and gave notice to over achievers or as people became more skilled, basically they showed us we were appreciated in a workplace where the calls coming in, appreciation was sometimes hard to come by."
good,"gives you skills even if you never worked at a call center, great staff, schedules are flexible, fun place to work with  lots of opportunites andprovides lots of training for personal development"
good,"Auditing & business facilitating"
good,"I was actually very content working there.  I liked answering phones and thought I was good at it.  I even had others tell me I was good.  But, when it came time to certify a bad call was selected and I was let go.  Too bad their loss."
good,"Belfast has many call centres, and staff move from one to the other on an extremely regular rate. Whilst it does really depend on the contract your on what kind of experieince your going to have."
good,"1. Job Security"
good,"Work was really interesting and each every single scenario of our work was a learning curve and enjoyable..."
good,"before it became Convergys it was Stream Global Services, at Stream we had a very good incentive programs and different perks as an employee. you will never be bored because they have gaming room and a gym. But when Convergys takes over, everything is gone now. Convergys is just typical company that would make a great employee leave."
good,Great healthcard. Pays on time. Government taxes are paid regularly. Management still needs improvement. More pro client than pro employees...........
good,We have open door policy which really help us to voice our concerns. They have given me an opportunity to be an SME and support roles which helps me to overcome my shyness.
good,"Typical day at work: provide technical support for inbound calls regarding tracking packages/software support."
good,The program I worked for was Comcast. I worked nights and it was so much fun. They did have some incentives and perks. Very easy to be trained and on the phones in as little as two days.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Manage the team and its performance, Monitoring and feedback to better performance. Ensure that the SLA is meet and drive performance. Meeting up with reporting Manager to report any issue or team performance and improvement plans. Trained on the process as Leaders as coaches. Good environment as we work as a team and help each other as we work as a team to meet the clients requirements. To convince the team to go and achieve the extra mile to meet clients critical targets at times. To prove our creditably."
good,"The Job of an Associate Trainer is a challenging one, you are one stop shop for all the required information for your Trainees, and management. The job has its own share of challenges and fun."
good,The job is one that dose requires diligent time keeping and commitment to the job if you don't work with them they wont work with you but if you do work with them they will work with you.
good,"The training classes they held were fun and very informative, once out on the floor you know what to do and how to handle everything. But after a while some of the floor coaches would pull you aside and tell you to start selling more products or they will write you up."
good,"Great company management changes too often, great shift flexibility. Overall good company management should do better with their decision making, there should be more contact us options for employees. There should also be an appeal option for survey metrics that should be more so escalated to upper management rather than the agent directly. Good work incentives program! "
good,"troble shooting / at&t contract. at& t computer, tv, and internet selling and activation. was a call center setting took call throw a dialer. and some product selling"
good,"The typical day was taking incoming calls from customers with routing needs. I learned how GPS and mapping worked. Management was helpful. There were people from all parts of the USA. Even though we were in North Carolina; in the training class, out of 19 people I remember less than10% were actually from North Carolina. Stress came when there was some sort of high scale tragedy, hurricanes, snow storms, ect. However we were well trained and had sufficient tools to successfully assist the caller. The majority of the calls were customers who just purchased a new vehicle, so they called in excited, and happy."
good,Your workload is not well compensated. The management should take care of its employees so that attrition rate would be lesser. Profit sharing is surprisingly unacceptable.
good,"Good in Learning "
good,Overall good company .. Hmmmm it recently took over the CRM part of IBM..  This is my second job n it was good learning experience for me..
good,The work can vary depending on your project. What makes this place awesome is the people you work with. I miss them already.
good,"At work, the people around are helpful they made it easy for me to get through with my problems. however, the schedule and time is a bit difficult its not fixed and you must need to prepare yourself for a lot of changes. Glad I made it though , because Im really typical with my time- make sure that I will not be late at work."
good,"For the freshers it is the best company to begin their career, and career growth is high and very good team and process work,good working environment."
good,"Here I learn a lot about leadership via training,lots of opportunity to enhance the skill. Management also encourage to participate in such kind of training which enhance the skill not only supervisor also for the associates."
good,"• Maximize revenue generation to reach long and short term financial projects (i.e. data collection for billable/non-billable hours, forecasting, budgeting, etc.) "
good,"Converges is a good company they keep their words for employee growth , they are not going to through out their employee in one go they have bunch of process so if a candidate will not fit in that they are going to move candidate to another process with no conditions and during the time of new training they'll continue pay and other benefit as it is."
good,Answered calls in a timely manner regarding many issues. Promoted sales and created revenue for the company. I learned a lot about prescription drugs and handling customer inquiries. Management wasn't too bad although there is some room for improvement with the team leads actually being able to assist staff with issues. Workplace culture was very supportive and friendly. Hardest part of the job was definitely trying to deal with things that weren't apart of the job scope. Most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help people and my coworkers.
good,"Working with Convergys, or CVG as we refer to it back then, was really a great experience. The people you\ll meet there are so nice and they are willing to help you with everything."
good,"Worked for 6 months here so far, the people are great, the work is acceptable, the contract I am on is solid. My PPM is awesome (not all of them are, though) and the work is easy."
good,"I do like the job but it doesn't pay good enough to be getting yelled at, i learned alot from this job that the customer is not always right and theres alot of identity theft"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Had a good time with Convergys. Colleagues and officers are approachable. The hardest part in the job was upselling but I learn alot of techniques and strategies from tenured agent and from Team Lead by doing side by side coaching or barging in.
good,"I learned problem solving skills, expanded my skills on customer service. "
good,"When I started at this Company everything was awesome, with the training experience and the team that I was put in. The work environment is friendly and fun."
good,People are easy to work with. You can easily approach the bosses. I believe most of the BPO company has their own downfall and what's good with Concentrix is that they hear your voices. they ask for improvement.
good,It's a great place to start for people looking for entry level call center customer service positions. Very social and independent environment.
good,"Convergys is the right place to work , job environment is also good but as far as the salary is concerned that is very slow as comaped to other companies so try to be on the right track"
good,"Professional environment.  Inbound call center, contracting out to multiple tech related telecommunications companies. "
good,"This job was a great place to go to work when re-entering the work force.  Hours were flexible, training was good, the project I worked on was fun and easy."
good,"With every call center, there will be good and bad. At CONVERGYS, it's really easy to get caught up in negativity which is the gateway to an unfulfilling time. I remain cordial with everyone, but keep to myself and it's the best job I've ever had. If you want an opportunity, CONVERGYS will give it to you. They truly believe in promoting from within as coaching is the foundation of operations."
good,"Although the job was strenuous having to work with different kinds of clients, Convergys made sure that employees were well- compensated. Annual appraisals were also done to make sure that top performers were given due incentives."
good,This was a 24/7/365 job. I just wish they had more of a balanced work/life situation. The people I worked with as well as my immediate supervisors were great.
good,"I loved it and really felt like i could advance but my team lead wasn't too friendly. Felt like she discriminated against most of her team. She was very rude and did not like to help or coach me to be a better sales agent, not that i had any problems. She did not like taking escalations from customers either. I really wanted to help my customers to the best of my ability, but i felt my team lead did not want to help and solve their problems."
good,"wroking at convergys is my biggest opportunities that everyone dream, my experience working in convergys company give me a lot of leaning and excell my knowledge and mold my ability to face some different people."
good,Can sometimes be a pain but its a great place to start your customer service experience. The building did have bed bugs at one point and sometimes people's systems will be down.
good,"It was fun working at convergys as the work culture, environment and colleagues all were up to mark. The incentive system was good and we used to earn a lot through it."
good,It's very tiring but enjoyable and the work environment is very good. My co-workers are very friendly and I can say that Convergys is a very good company
good,"A lot has been said about Convergys, and it does have a very well deserved bad reputation. However, the good outweighs the bad, for the most part. Many of the perks include paid time off, that you accrue as soon as you start work and are generally able to take when you need. There is also unpaid time off, which is basically a way to call out without being penalized. As for actually calling out, another perk is that they do have a very lenient attendance policy. You get one point for each day missed, but you don't get terminated until you have reached 12 points. They do a lot of ""earnbacks"", which means that if you miss a day and accrue a point, you can make it up, thus not getting the point."
good,"very good workplace, though you will have nothing but irritated Customers on most contracts as hold times are incredibly long. The Typical person was on hold for 30 minutes before reaching a live person on the contract I was working on."
good,"This job is wonderful. The staff are some of the most caring people I have ever had the pleasure of working with. As with any job there are a few people who you will not get along with, though it is the worst  when those people are in management or supervisor positions. Over all I have had great experiences being employed by Concentrix, formerly Minacs and would recommend the company to many."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"working with convergys was a great learning experience.It taught me everything.There could not have been a better start, as it is the first company i have worked with.The team leaders and team mates were amazing and very helpful."
good,"At Convergys, a typical day at work included signing into your computer about 5 minutes early so you did not get a point for being late. For a while you could only have 8-16 late occurrences a year but they bumped it up to 12-24. I learned that I need management that works with me because we had a weekly meeting where I was told to improve but was not told how I could. I reached out to a supervisor instead of a manager and found some ways to improve. I did find it enjoyable how I was surrounded by great people and the feeling of satisfaction you get from helping people and making their day. It was the best feeling you could have had. All in all, its a great place to work short time, and for some long term, but not for me."
good,Thumbs up for this company as it is able to meet or even exceeds the standards of a continuously growing company. Benefits given are all good. Colleagues are professionals especially the top management.
good,"I liked working at this job because I was good at my work so I reaped the benefits handsomely when payday came around. In regards to the Job culture, I believe they let anyone work here for the most part, which can be a good and bad thing, As with almost every call center in america the people are very negative and most people are just here to get the hourly pay not even attempting to get the commission bonuses, I think most people thought they were unreasonable and unattainable. But I loved a challenge. The management team is pretty competitive and do what they can to keep it lively. Be careful however because they can be underhanded sometimes in regards to competitiveness and they definitely have favorites. Attendance is very important here. If you can stay consistent they will work with you and pay you well. Oh! They love to promote from within."
good,"typical day was preparing and setting up meals for large golf tournaments"
good,"Getting a yearly appraisal is great however promotions are too slow and the politics is really unstoppable. "
good,"Being in the call center industry I learned a lot from handling people, customer service. management staff, and most of all  improving my personality and perspective  about managers and how to become a leader that inspires is what  l learned from Convergys."
good,"I was working as a Customer/Sales and Technical Support in Convergys Philippines.This is one of the biggest company in our country. I also have experience in administrative jobs. I am very good in communicating with other people. I am hardworking, patience and very keen/detailed to my job. I have a visit visa for 3months which will expire on January"
good,"Being part of Convergys is fantastic but growth in the hierarchy is very Medium. If anyone wants to learn or applies his/ her knowledge this is the right company."
good,The overall management and the infrastructure is good. Environment is encouraging to work hard so that the targets can be achieved.
good,"make calls"
good,"Great place to move up from the starting positions, great career advancement, fast paced ever changing environment, managers always have the ""open door"" policy. Co-workers are always eager to help one another with best practices and feedback. Great abilities for improving linguistic skills as well as hearing what the issues are rather than guessing. Working within a factory for many years and coming to a call center I have learned communication skills 10 fold as well as multitasking and how to overcome bias and ignorance when speaking on a phone with clients and actually hearing their concerns and sometimes dissecting their language and words to get to root of the issue. hardest part of the job is being confronted by a disgruntled customer and maintain a calm empathetic approach to resolve the issue. Because of this type of call I was able to have a better understanding of using tone and choice words rather than be confrontational, and this actually works very well. One of the most enjoyable aspects of my job is just following procedures and stopping social engineers from attaining proprietary information. sometimes though it is not always that easy, I will be honest with you. There are times where the pressure can be a bit overwhelming on the job, and my best advice is to remember ""one call at a time"", Use your support system and try and remain calm when you feel like you are in the hot seat, because this will happen to you."
good,"I did not get past training, due to mental issues."
good,"Work at home in your pajamas. Very friendly and helpful coworkers. Training is an adjustment, as everything is done virtually on the computer. Once you get the hang of communicating through chats and shared screens, it is easy. Great option for person looking for alternative ways of making money without leaving the house."
good,"It's my first job and it is not what I expected it would be. The job is toxic, requires us to do multiple work with low compensation. Though incentive is great the job is overwhelming and very stressful."
good,Worked for a couple different contracts with company. Most is technical support assisting customer with fraud issues and alerts with account. Great company to work for.
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with most. I also enjoyed how accommodating the company was in regards to dress codes. It was casual."
good,"Ive learned a lot especially taking care of our customers concern and resolving the issue that the customers facing. And putting the smile on your customers face by helping them out. The hardest part where we need to compute each and of their expenses however, we get used to and i am engage by handling that kind of situation. Co-workers easy to be with."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"I am glad to join Convergys .It is really great place to work in terms of professional and financial growth.I learnt a lot since i joined ."
good,worked there on three different occasions was overall a very good place to work. Staff very knowledgeable and for the most part ready to help. good break schedule but only one paid break and only half hour dinner.
good,Training was easy. It was pretty simple as far as my job duties. Most of my coworkers I came in contact with were very nice and friendly. Lunch could have been longer since the lunch area was really small and no one had time to leave to get lunch.
good,They pressure you all the time to sell. Yes that is part of your job but at the same time you can't always make the sale. Not everyone is a brilliant salesperson that can word everything correctly.
good,Such a great experience. I learned to be competitive and think out of the box. I was able to build self confidence and improve my communication skills.
good,"I found that the job as a whole was enjoyable, however, it does not match my personality type. I found that work related stress was starting to affect my overall health. Would recommend for those who can deal with complaint/issues well and not take anything personally."
good,"My superiors in this company were very supportive to me and they wanted me to be regularize but suddenly there is no slot for me to be regularized, that is why they let go of me."
good,"The people I worked with in Convergys were some of the best people I've ever met, however the management was some of the worst I've ever experienced. I did however enjoy the job role."
good,After working there for three years I've seen lists of ups and downs but overall good company to work for the thing I would change is following thru on what they say
good,Es un trabajo que exige grandes jornadas laborales y tiempo nocturno.
good,During the work their many thinks to be learned which are usedful in my life ...During the job their will be the satisfaction because customer also get satisfied with us
good,"Customer Service demands diplomacy and soft personal skills. I possess these skills, plus a healthy sense of humor. Patience and intelligence are essential tools as well. I enjoy the satisfaction of dealing with problems and solving them, or at least achieving a workable solution. I work with very accomplished people, supervisors who are generous with their assistance and guidance. The compensation is too low for the demands and skill sets that are desired."
good,"Working at Concentrix has always been Fun and very much Comfortable , i wouldnt be here for almost 3 years if not. They taught me a lot of things when it comes to customer service, being patient and keen on others concern. My co workers are very friendly and accomodating as well. The hardest part of the job i believe is that you  can never tell what attitudes and grievances the customer has when you receive their call and you need to adjust whatever temper they got within the call. The good part of it is when you resolve their concerns and problems....hearing them acknowledging your help and even thanking you wholeheartedly feels very much fulfilled it takes away all the stress and negativity in you."
good,Very flexible work environment.  Colleagues and management is spread out around the country making communication difficult at times.  Management does not micro-manage and trusts employees to get the work done.
good,"I loved working at convergys, I learned so much from that job. The benefits were great. We got to work with a few different companies. Each project was a great new and exciting experience."
good,I am working as verfired for maruthi insurance..i enjoy my work very much and i complet all my task. my work is enjoyabl and i have no complain about my work and job..
good,"Typical day at work is picking up the phone and providing great customer service while trying to sell your customer a product, what I've learned on this job is how to better assist consumers and talk to them more professionally. The hardest part of this job would probably be trying to sell something to someone who does not want what you are offering them. The management is great, Co-workers are great and the most enjoyable part is seeing how you can affect someone's life in a positive way."
good,"-daily activities for all the employees"
good,"Convergys is a good company. However, the reason why I left the company it is because of the graveyard shift. I didn't have tie anymore with my kids since I am asleep during daytime."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Convergys was my dream company and it is considered as the biggest private employer in the Philippines that's why I feel so grateful and honored to be part of that prestigious company. "
good,"It's a good place to work, but the pay is very low. Great place to get some experience! The hours are good and the contracts are fun and interesting. The hourly wage just doesn't pay the bills."
good,"Overall was an great learning experience, I learned a lot from this company that I still use today. One of my most admired things about this places was the environment it was always about having fun while making sure the customer's very satisfied."
good,Great place to work at and the people are wonderful. Great location and advancement.Awersome work enivorment and great location.
good,"i enjoyed learning to support products I was not familiar with"
good,"Everything is fine- the facilities, the compensations, the benefits, the allowances, the incentives. However, the career growth there is very slow. You can't just apply for the positions you want since there are few job offers but so many pending applications."
good,"Coworkers are mostly mentally strong; call center work quickly weeds out the weak and unrealistically chipper."
good,Its a good starter job to get you off your feet. Its the place that could help you get your first car and establish a home to live in.
good,"At work what was expected was angry customers, in which we the representatives learnt how to deal with; how to calm them down. The management was alright and co-workers were friendly."
good,Great place to work once you get to understanding your job you will be fine. Dress code needs improvement tho. And hiring should be a little better
good,"had a great training program, truly a customer driven company. flexible work schedules. work was rewarding at times. Had a great promotional features for employee like rewards for excellent service to customers."
good,"- involves daily routine but very nice workplace to work for "
good,"i loved the way i got expose to every Technology at Minacs. An elegant customer service system for dealing with inbound ticket requests from most channels, phone,chat-and In Person"
good,"This is a good company. They give very easy ways to earn extra money, but the starting pay is horrible. For the amount of work you do and the pressure that you are under, the pay should be much more. Other than that this is a great place to work. I like it alot."
good,"Handle questions via phone addressing billing, upgrades or troubleshooting  issues for telecommunications, cable and technology "
good,"Convergys is where I gained & develop my skills & knowledge but at the same time, no room for career growth. You really have to invest time & effort before they can acknowledge you."
good,"We have sleeping quarters exclusive for the Command Center."
good,"working on this company is really nice, its just that the hardest part of my job is my travelling hours. im from bulacan and everyday im travelling for about 2 hours, depending if its traffic or not.but the most enjoyable part of my job is we just keep on doin the same thing everyday"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"A typical day day at work would be fun and interesting the opportunity to talk to different types of person it builds your character on how you deal to every person you will be talking to. Learning to adjust to the way management handles and office mates attitude is important. Learning to adhere and accept is a must. Passing metrics will be difficult at first but eventually you will get the hang of it and if you hit your metrics, you will surely reap your reward"
good,"Convergys is a great company, though they must at least increase the basic salary of the agents. Nothing so much, that's all."
good,My co workers were the best part that i had here. Everybody is so helpful that anyone can easily adjust and like the work environment.
good,Enjoyed the people that I worked with.  Hardest part about the job was the constant changes in the program that you worked on and not enough training for what you had to do
good,Career goal builder. Enjoyable working department that boost the morale of the co-workers to further along the company desires.
good,The Company is fun to work for never really a bad day in work. Can get very busy at times but that is the same for everywhere. The mangers are very good and very fair.
good,"Pretty high stress for minimal pay, but the work itself was enjoyable for the the most part. Hours were flexible, and there were automated systems to track and apply for time off."
good,They work with people really well to make sure they can work with and accommodate all of the employees needs. They only had two 10 minute breaks Although that was just the dtv project witch is the better of the projects they have to offer.
good,"Convergys is a good entry level job. Typical day at work is answering live calls from customers all day. Learned to multitask and progressively work on my own self improvement. The supervisors that work with you are great, but the operation managers are ""stiff."" It's all black and white with them, however, that is expected from a job with high turnout. Co-workers come and go by the week, but are mostly enjoyable to work with. The hardest part of the job is to constantly keep improving yourself to increase your performance as an agent. I really enjoy job seeing the improvement you've made as an agent, and how much more you can keep improving."
good,It was a okay place overall. I loved my job as a representative but my manage was the least of my favorite part coming to work.
good,good job good pay a lot of changes on  a daily bases some good leaders with some who were not would suggest  a job there good benefits health and life insurance
good,"The pay is good, and management is pretty good as well. The hardest part is dealing with screaming customers on the phone and trying to de-escalate the situation so you can try to help them. The company seems to be family oriented and helps their employees out with time off or getting overtime when it is available."
good,In this job I was to engage with clients and understand their needs and react accordingly with the tools that were provided. I learned to communicate effectively with my peers on scheduling in order to meet service levels and company needs. Management was always willing to work with you when it came to scheduling. Hardest part of the job was being able to adjust to the change in scheduling. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with great people.
good,"Convergys is a company that develops skills and potentials thru series of leadership, Management trainings and online courses."
good,"Overall experience with this company has been average. They have wonderful employees to work with, and offer great benefits and incentives for job referrals, however they do not have the best time management for working with staff in regards to home life, emergencies, and other responsibilities. "
good,I was working here as a vendor for Microsoft. The work culture was same as Microsoft. Great place to expertise your skills and technologies.
good,"Everything was perfect until Convergys acquired Stream Global Services. Convergys changed a lot to stream. HMO, Program stuctures etc. which i beleive is not a good idea. Sometimes agents efforts are not recognized. The bosses are getting richer and richer with less efforts while the agents are just the same knowing that they are the ones consisting and contributing to the programs."
good,in-bound call center for multiple lines of business.  Friendly management.  High turn over because they hire just about anybody.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Working in Convergys has been very helpful to my career advancement. I get to work with people from different nationalities such as Canada, US, India, UK and the others. We highly value diligence and easy resolution on which I will be able to carry with me that will be of help on any circumstance I encounter. In CVG, there is passion for work and teamwork is needed on a daily basis. Although, one must be able to stand on their own at times. CVG's also has a very competitive environment and sometimes people get frustrated if goals and deadlines are not met. I am glad to have worked for this company that puts excellence over anything else."
good,"The goal on a daily basis was very cut and dry; take as many calls as possible in an 8 hour shift while giving the customers the best quality service as possible.  I learned a good deal about dealing with many people from many walks of life.  I also learned a good from, not only the management and support teams but also a good deal from the more veteran co-workers."
good,Receiving and greeting the customers as they walk through the doors and providing customer service to each individual.

good,Wonderful to work with the company. It's a very good platform to start your career. You can apply through consultancies or directly visit the premises.
good,"Job is fair, easy and sometimes fun. Management can be rough to handle but depending on who you get as a team leader and how you are as a person it will go great. Great pay and bonuses."
good,It was a Pleasant experience in bpo's where i learned to speak with controlled and effective mannerism of giving solutions to customers.my communications skills got well n well everyday as i dealed with all type of people ...
good,It was a good place to work at. The company itself did not care for the agents. They just cared to make money. The benefits were not that great. They did offer 41k.

good,Fun environment and excellent benefits. Very good HR team. Fun work place with supportive management. Had a lot of on the job learning in this organization.
good,"On average, Convergys had really competitive benefits for its employees.  A typical workday can be stressful if you let customers get under your skin.  You must develop detachment syndrome otherwise other people's problems become your problem.  Management is typical for a call center where your stats mattered above all else.  I had a great team leader that motivated, but some of my co-workers did not."
good,"Overall Convergys is a good company,Specially in or account they offer good pay. However this past few month there's a change in management and metrics changes almost every month, policy changes every now and then, customers get confused sometimes of sudden changes all the time."
good,"It is a very nice place to work over all, their is just not much room to advance anytime soon. It's a great JOB, I'm looking for a great CAREER!"
good,"Started my day by reading my emails. Checking for any update, inquiries, verification, escalation so that I can cascade that with my team. "
good,"Work environment is very lax.  We can wear what we want and we even had a ping pong table in our break area.  The people there are amazing.  However, management could be a little bit better as they always seem to do things at the very last minute."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"A typical day at work was me being prompt each day responding to a high call volume and helping customers with theyre issues. I learned many different skills and learned to cope with the different personalities I came across each day, on and off the the phones. Managers had to work extremely hard day in and day out making sure that everything stay in line, and my co-workers were all easy and out going individuals. When I was unable to help customers I came across was the hardest part working in this environment, and the most enjoyable part was coming to work in a positive environment and being able to successfully help my customers"
good,"In this job, it is hard since it's all about producing sales through communicating with customers in the United States. There's a language barrier that makes it more difficult however while I'm in the company, I managed to produced a sale in the best way that I can especially if the customer doesn't really want to buy our products. I've learned in this job to be more positive and to communicate well in English but not that much since I'm just a newbie and in a probationary employee in the company. My co-workers there are kind and fun persons. I enjoy my stay there because of my wavemates and trainers when I was in training."
good,"Great start to work in a call centre environment, everyday you will learn something new, product changes..i loved meeting my co workers"
good,"Concentrix Corp is the first Corporate Company that employed me as I used to do Free-lance Business.  Although I had  other job experiences before but I would say that it's Concentrix who gave me a Corporate Identity.  My job in this company has been a comfort zone for me since I've been here for over 8 Years.  And being here for quite some time, it has been a bit routinary and would be boring at times, but I still do my job efficiently.  Our Department has limited slots for promotions as we only have a single organization with limited management positions, but still it's worth having to work with a great team everyday."
good,"Excellent training programs thoroughly prepare employees for the job. Supportive inclusion programs ensure success. Flexible scheduling is a plus. Great benefits for healtcare, financial improvement, purchasing power, and much more."

good,A typical day there was answering calls reguarding a 3rd party vendor. I learned a lot about technical issues and tech support in general there as well as call center ettique. The management was awesome and my co workers were fun to be around. The hardest part of the job was not going overboard in helping the customers out but realizing there is a time to set up for a tech to come out to see them. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people i met and was able to talk with. It was a wonderful experience
good,Great pay. Management not so great. I learned how to have great phone etiquette and to deescalate confrontational calls.
good,"My day involved being on the phone prompt. What i how to get people to understand hands free talking while driving. Management was understanding and great people always make you laugh they did different contest to make it exciting as well. Co-workers was kool.The hardest was to get alot of the customers to understand how important the hands free mintues are and compared to cell phones today. I enjoied the Contest ,management, free lunches from time to time when doing good."

good,"A basic day at the company is clocking in start taking calls you have two fifteen minute breaks and one hour lunch through the course of your shift , I learned top of the line customer service, tech support skills, management is semi ok they can do allot better on educating employees better on benefits. Co-worker are really nice amazing atmosphere. The hardest part is the scheduling and keeping down attendance  points they make it so easy for you to get them but hard to drop them off so eventually they have great employees leaving or being let go because of having to many points even though there stats are at top of the performance list  and the employee with a  bad performance has less points but there stats are awful get to stay , so then it puts the the TL in a hard place and they allot of times have to let some of the best people on there team go. The enjoyable part of the job is actually getting great call from customers who enjoy the experience of the call with you and will want to call back for any assistants."
good,I basically helped all advisors that needed help on the phone and coached them when they were not performing up to company standards.
good,"i find no work hard, its only the way we do it makes it hard. i believe in working hard but in a Smarter way and I believe that everyday is a new days at work."
good,"I enjoyed working from home for Amazon.com through Convergys. I was able to work from home.  This was very convenient during spring time storms, or snowy winter days or nights."
good,"A typical day at work starts off as a fast paced environment that we need to be used to. I learned how to communicate to Australians more effectively. my co-workers are the same as me, trying to learn the ropes and do the best we can to provide a great customer experience. The hardest part of the job is to be familiar with the company's advanced software for handling billing concerns. The most enjoyable part of the job is by the end of the day, I feel fulfilled that I was able to assist the customer and I was able to provide and exceed their expectations."
good,I have learned a lot about myself here. I am very people oriented and enjoy assisting customers in an inbound call centre environment. The hardest part about this job is my current work schedule. It is not currently convenient for my family life. What I love about this job is the people that I work with. They allow you to enjoy your job and have lots of support to perform your job to the best of my ability.
good,"build a good relationship with management and co-mates learned about various types of customer interaction ,retention skills., learned how to enjoy fun with work"

We must answer the query of a customer satisfactorily as fast as we can because our being rated through it. We have a score card and we need to pass it for us to stay in our job. If our score card failed, we will undergone trainings again or worst we will be terminated."

Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"I enjoy this position and would recommend to friends and colleagues. Great work environment, enjoy the people I work with and the work I do is interesting."
good,Convergys is a job that after training you are equipped with the basic knowledge dealing with the needs of our customers. After consistency you learn more and can become proficient in the job. Over time I learned how to greater expand on my multi-tasking skills and better solve problems immediately in working with customers in a timely manner. There are opportunities for advancement if you work hard at it
good,friendly co workers and approachable management. stress free environment with free lunches and good benefits. free movie passes and parties. with incentives.
good,"A good company that you can be working for the rest of your working life. Nice work place, nice people, and even amenities are okay. Hardest part maybe is selling something to the costumer, but you can deal with that since you will be trained form time to time specially if you really have difficulties with it. Its fun working there since people are crazy (in a good way) and management allow us to have fun while working."
good,"-graveyard shift w/ your boss rushing because your team is failing"
good,"Convergys is not a bad company to work for. They will adjust your schedule for school or family issues. They have a really relaxed dress code and liberal attendance policy. The managers appear to care and recognize good performance. "
good,Fun fast paced environment with plenty of opportunities to advance. another great benefit is being able to enjoy one of the best satellite providers for free!
good,"Fast paced, often number driven, with by the book management.  Learned that in a call center environment, you need to be able to put away all morals, principals, and ethics, so that you can keep the customer paying your wage happy.  The customer is not the person calling in for support. There are processes and procedures in place for a reason.  You have to be able to keep in mind, at all times, that the person on the phone is not your customer.  You have to be able, at times, to set aside your own beliefs and feelings when handling calls."
good,"Good experience, not enough money... management was wonderful though. and this company was very organized... they had their .... together. that's for sure"
good,receiving inbound calls dealing with customers and fixing technical issues while recording and multitasking offering sales to these customers as well

good,I have learned a lot especially when handling different types of customer. They have great trainers and supervisors. Every coaching I have there will be always something I learned about.
good,"gained greater customer service skills, great people and great work environment"
good,This is a wonderful company if you are a fresher. I am glad about people who join this company will get good offers after 1 year.
good,"Typical work day for here was pretty easy, go in and clock in then just wait for a phone call to come in since it was a telecommunications job, answering questions about billing and services all shift. Most of the management was helpful and relaxed but some of them were rather testy about the job in general, the co-workers were pretty care-free too and just went through the day doing their job. The hardest part about it though I would have to say is the numbers we had to meet each month, sometimes it was harder due to the economy changing though. The most enjoyable part though was probably the co-workers, if it was a slow day we usually just sat around conversing about what ever topic would arise."
good,"Convergys is all about exceptional customer service to customers who call in with questions and concerns about their Comcast accounts. Customers are very important to every company. For this reason, it is important to develop a great relationship with them. I have learned how to identify customer needs by having conversations with the many customers who I have assisted while working for this company."
good,The company was great to work for and very good reconition of employees that go above and beyond.
good,"You'll stay busy, because the call volume is high. Easy to advance if you do you job well. Also you may receive Quarterly incentives for jobs well done."
good,I learned a lot before i left Convergys i can say that the training and preparations and the efforts that they are giving their agents just for them to learn is totally a great experience for every applicant.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,inbound call centre so I spoke with many types of people with many different types of personalities/learned to adapt to client's needs.
good,"It good get start as a fresher, company has good environment, 8hours work split in good manner."
good,Typical day is being serious and putting a smile on and letting that smile sound through the phones while dealing with your customers. Co-workers are still very sociable and management still tries to have fun buy having incentives for employees while still being very professional physically and over the phone. This is a very enjoyable job.
good,"A typical day would include getting there, finding a seat, getting prepared for the work day, answer the telephone and assist customers. I learned many new things every day. The management was alright, needed to be a little more organized on how they placed the team leaders so there would always be enough help on the floor. The co-workers were just fine, very nice. The hardest part would be dealing with the angry customers and if needing help sometimes it was hard to find."
good,"Client meetings, great management, relationship building"
good,"A typical day at work was very fast-paced and exciting.  You never know what type of personality you would meet on a day to day basis.  The company had excellent incentives for overtime and management was usually available to answer any questions or concerns.  There were different perks for each department such as pizza parties, bowling vouchers for after work activities, etc. co-workers were close-by, ready to help each other out.  The hardest part of the job would sometimes be not having a lunch break during the busiest hours that would have to be given later.  The best part of the job would be the overtime pay that was great, and the incentives to come in on your days off which was spectacular!"
good,"taking calls from Att Customers to review Billing , Troubleshoot Iphones and to assist with self serve options"
good,Good environment when working with tech-support client. Low pay to start but room for improvement within first 1-2 years.  Good corporate culture/structure.  Excellent benefits.
good,They are not conducive to your life outside of work. Not family oriented. Co-workers are wonderful. Benefits are too expensive. And they have no job security.

good,"good place to work but low salary as per work"
good,Convergys call center was very busy and noisy. While being an employee I learned how to handle angry customers and how to manage many different work systems at once.
good,"It was constant work, which is something I love. Data Entry is one of my favorite tasks, and there was plenty of that here at Covergys. The managment team was awesome, helpful, and always available if help was needed."
good,"I was an DSL troubleshooting agent. This was a very enjoyable job I primarily sat at a computer listened to the customer, resolved their issue by reading directions from the computer.  Not that hard of a job great learning experience.  Meet a lot of new people.  The position paid well for me at the time."
good,decent work enviornment. Not much seats open. always giving out over time
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Training was fun and we definitely learned a lot, overall a good place to work"
good,"Good job if you plan on staying there forever, does have advancement, but not guaranteed. Does have some very good benefits such has health benefits and unlimited overtime. Co-workers some are very snobby people there think that they are better than everyone else, but then you have the people that you become really good friends with and they are always there to help when you need it. The management it okay, they tend to play favorites and they also like to pick people out that they don't like and give them a hard time.  The hardest part of this job is having to listen to angry customers scream and cuss at you."
good,"- always has a routine"
good,Excellent work place.  Great Work rotation.  Management could be more considerate in its bonus programs.
good,the hardest part of the job is  having 35 sales per week for you to have  your commision
good,"A typical day at work is hard to describe because I work in very fast pace environment.  I start my day with doing payroll and check my emails from my team members.  I get my few monitors done.  I coach and develop my team members, which is a big part of my job. The management has given us our basic duties which has to be done on daily basis, but the other assignments can be added regularly.  I attend a lot of meetings and training.  "
good,I was a call center agent for 8 years with this employer. I have several awards for customer service experience. I enjoy helping people and making sure the call/issue is resolved  Unfortunately there was no place for me to better myself and the company. There was no room for advancement.
good,Convergys is a call center and I know there are lots of cliques about working in any call center but to be honest from all of the personal and professional opinions I have heard about man different places this one did get some of the best reviews. It is a fun place to work and an overall good environment. They have an amazing leadership staff that is always willing to support you in your work. Though you are sitting in a cubical taking phone call after phone call the great thing is that you never have the same call twice. Every conversation is different which always brings something new to the table. When I was working there I made a ton of new friends that I went on having friendships with outside of work. I never knew you could make a call center job this interesting! They offered lots of different goals and successes here. Anything from raffles to group goal rewards there was always a way to achieve something new. Also moving up in the company is a simple task as long as you put the work in! Which means there is a lot of room for it being a potential career path!
good,"I've worked for Convergys for a total of 7 years and have had good times.  Overall, I had a good experience with the company.  They offer decent benefits, management was easy to communicate with, and it feels fairly secure.  My department had a low turnover rate and I didn't have to go to work feeling stressed about  employment. My coworkers are easy to work with.  The hardest part has to be how short staffed we are, but other than that, it isn't a bad gig."
good,"•             Take calls to assist customers with billing issues and all type of service issues(cdv,hsi,&video)"
good,Converges offers many services to companies who use outsource customer service. Over all this was a good company to work for
good,"my days at work always were started quiet, as the day progressed things got louder and busier. i learned to never underestimate the knowledge of a customer, and to always smile while talking to them, they can sense your feelings about them or to them. my co-workers were all very young and slow paced but fun to be around. The hardest  part of the job was not being able to help an upset/frustrated customer. i enjoyed going to work and learning about the products that we were selling, i also enjoyed getting the calls from customers that just made no sense but were fun to experience."
good,"Covergys is a decent employer, with good benefits, although a highly stressful environment, the people i work with are great and my direct supervisor is a great person to work for."
good,The hardest part of my job on the regualar basis was lack of consistency among management. There were several managers but often job requirements were not made clear and job duties passed out were often conflicting. It just unfortunately made it a little more difficult to make sure the customer had the best experience possible. But I always did the best that I could to make dealing with my company the best that could possibly be.
good,It's a great company to work for if you can make sales. Attendence policy is very leniant
good,"On a typical day I would take inbound phone calls from cellular dealers and run credit checks, advise of deposit amount, and activate new phone purchases. Also I performed changes of financial responsibility (transferring a contract from one customer to another)"
good,"A typical day at work was to come into the building sign onto my station and once I was signed on I was to log into the phone and start receiving calls."
good,"Aditya Birla Minacs is world wide ltd company and Minacs Ranchi is a part of its. My overall experience is fine in this company. A typical day there would consist of sitting and troublebleshooting technical issues and presure by client. The most important thing I learned on the job "
good,"Convergys has the potential to be one of the best places that you could possibly work, but you need to be willing to work. I learned how to better educate adults, assess proficiency and set priorities."
good,Pay skill is very low to the amount of work required. But I good place to work.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Typical day consisted of answering phones, submitting applications for health and dental insurance. Co-workers were fun and easy to get along with during and after working hours. For the most part, management was easy to work with. Hardest part of the job was hearing customers particular situations that would make the insurance too high in premium."
good,Call center located on the far north end of Houston. Many days and nights fielding calls.
good,"Good work culture, good working environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is solving customer issues."
good,"calls all day"
good,"I loved that it was a local company, and almost everything came from Canada."
good,"I start my day trying to log in and pull of 10 different tools on computer, majority of them requiring signing into them, only given about 5 minutes before I have to log into the phone. (it is a very unrealistic task). From then I on, I take tech assistance calls for trouble shooting cable, internet, phone, and home security. I learn something new everyday. The hardest part of the job is the fact that was only given 3 weeks to learn all about the services and how to troubleshoot them (not enough time), and the fact that they know that the majority of the training is on the job (once start taking phone calls). I feel very unprepared for many situations during the day it is stressful.  The most enjoyable part of the day is talking to customers and actually am able to help them solve their problems and connect with them in some way.  My TL doesn't really listen to what we have to say. I work with a lot of younger folks who don't have not learned what appropriate work ethic is."
good,"A typical day at work would be dealing with both customers that are happy about the service provided and not happy about the service that was provided. I learned how to communicate better with a variety of different cultures. The management was very helpful if that person was your team leader. I found that the management at this location did very little to help with any questions or problems if you are not directly assigned to that team leaders team. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with customers that were not happy with the companies service they were provided, some customers would demand refunds or to directly speak with the president/chairman of the company which is not always able to provide refunds or to speak with who they wanted to speak with. The most enjoyable part of the job was having good co-works to speak with and to work out problems ourselves when management was not always around."
good,My role was to help with existing orders for a major online retailer. I kept in contact with customers by phone and email. I had regular coaching sessions which helped me improve as the job went on. It had a laid back attitude which never negatively affected the professionalism of the work place. The most rewarding aspect of the job was leaving a happy customer at the end of an interaction.
good,"I learned a lot of things in my company, management was good and helpful, my co- workers were very helpful and friendly specially tenured people helped me a lot to learn the process and new things about the process, the hardest part of my job was shift timings which was changed every month, I enjoyed my work every time in the organisation specially my overtime in the organization."
good,This is a very business oriented job. It is basically a supply and demand job. Although it was a professional job we were able to watch tv while taking calls!
good,"A typical day of work for me would be clocking in taking in about 50-60 calls on average a day and clocking out."
good,There are so may client projects that Convergys has to offer.  Each month is new and presents challenges.  The first two weeks of the month are the most demanding on the workload but overall this is a great long term career.
good,"Customer Service Representatives Responsibilities Include:"
good,"It is a great company that provides wonderful customer service by trying to go out of it's way to make sure they meet their customer needs good or bad. I would recommend any of my family and friends to call in to speak to any of the highly trained representatives that they have working for them. My co-workers are amazing group of people, and hard working individuals who would go out of their way for any customer and that is way I consider them more like family. The hardest part of my job is trying to meet each customers needs because each situation is different."
good,"Got a fetal"
good,Started my career with one of the best BPO and went through V&A training which is one of the best in industry. It has improved my vocal skills to an extent and just cant forget Navy call list (lol).
good,"Dont work there. They take your soul. long hours, short breaks, no fun."
good,Answer the phones and help customers with directv questions. how to keep my calm even when getting cursed at. My team leader is always there to talk to and answer questions. Things change every day. My coworkers are very helpful when I have any type of questions. The hardest part of my job is to let people talk to me how they want and not get upset or let it get to me personally.
good,Good place to learn the job. Call center Experience is learned here with many leaders who give teaching and not just managers
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes!

good,"Convergys is an International BPO, It is good company,i have learnt ms excel.The management is good.The hardest part of the job is night shift,i am comfortable in evening shift.Fun activities and other activities are the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"walking in everyone greets you, warm smiles everywhere. always teachings of new products and plans we have available. well taught classes. management was outstanding did their job well, coached when necessary, even got on the phones made sales. hardest part was trying to keep up wit all the info constantly switching, got the hang of it though. I loved the atmosphere at the job. made me want to get up and work. being able to help people and know that you just made their life that much easier is the real reward."
good,Working in a fast pace environment. Using 7 plus systems and learning to work with different cultures. Management staff was good to work with and I enjoyed my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was leaving for a new job. The most enjoyable part of work is the work family created to keep the work day going.
good,I love working there the money was really good I enjoyed speaking with others everyday trying to help them out and also love to sale a premium movie. Some days where better than other days but overall it was a good job. Love helping my team get to the top. The most exciting time was NFL Sunday Ticket time we mad more money and others was happy to buy as well.
good,"To take inbound calls from customers of AT&T Uverse. I learned a lot about listening and responding quickly to customers issues. Problem solving skills and seeing problems through to a successful resolution."
good,target oriented and goal acheving place management and co workers both are work dedicated and goal acheivers and very supportive
good,"the was great, in a lot of aspects but not so great in others ( will explain )"
good,"Job has great people and is a good place to get experience with technical support and the management staff at the sites are great. Things above them are a lot more hard to deal with and the job itself can get a bit monotonous but, it is a great work environment the only x factor is the actual actions you are performing as a representative can be great easy and fun or hard demanding and trying just depends on who picks up that communication."
good,Learned alot about packages and helping customers taking inbound and outbound calls.
good,My job experience in Convergys was helpful in my development in handling different kinds of people and dealing with those with not so good characters. The management was okay.
good,"Customer service representatives answered phone calls from Sprint/Nextel customers for various problems with their phones."
good,Convergys was not a bad place to work it had good pay and had great benefits and you could easily advance if you wanted to. Management could use some improving but co workers were amazing.
good,"Typical day at work: out bound (cold) calls to customers of our campaign, at desk all done, using client/customer based software."
good,"My review for Convergy's I did really like it I had no problem working the hours I had a great time answering phone calls from nice Customer's on the phone The manager's knew their information very well."
good,It was more like a sells position which at times would add pressure but overall it was an easy ok job. The compensation could have been better when you make a sell. I enjoyed meeting a lot of different people.
good,rewarding job helping the community. although stressful and fast paced its very worth working there
good,"Very laid back place to work. You are responsible for taking inbound phone calls to sell cellular phones and accessories, as well as home services such as internet, home phone, and TV."
good,I haven't had many troubles since I started here at Convergys until they told us we only have 2 months left to work.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes!

I forayed into Training and quality vertical after working with the operations team so as to learn and develop and to experience the different training needs, challenges and requirements that came with that kind of diversity  because that is what I believe has help made me a holistic, innovative and out of the box thinker.  To get more exposure and analytic approach I then moved workforce management which has added on to my skills professionally."
good,"The call center culture isn't for everyone, but the people I have worked with at Convergys have always been wonderful to me."

good,Learned quite a bit about sales and customer service.  This position allowed me to enhance good communication skills.  
good,"During my time as a customer service representative at Convergys I was able to gain better knowledge of how to interact with people. Even though it was over the phone it gave me an outlook as to how a customer should be treated, over the phone or in person. The most enjoyable part of my job was meet new people on a daily basis such as my co-wokers. "

good,"Working with Convergys is a Great felling as the company provide you a very good exposure and helps you out to be competitive in the market."
good,"convergys is a great company and has a lot of room for growth but depending on the management style they tend to play dirty. the turn over rate is high because they have no problem training a new lot of applicants. learned a lot about technology and picked up great skills working with internet troubleshooting, but didnt feel comfortable with the management and your never really sure who can assist you with inquiries or concerns."
good,i really enjoyed working there .sometimes the customers got to be alot to handle but the overall experince was a good one
good,Everyday I save customers from canceling their plans. I save the customer by giving the customer six months of free text messaging or thirty dollar credit. I learned how to be more patient with the customer. My co-worker are amazing. Different personalities makes the job more fun. The hardest part about the job is the computers because it mess up couple time and it has the customer to be more inpatient. The celebrations we have through out the year.
good,Fast pace. Organizational skills a must. Team environment.
good,Customer service making inbound and outbound calls to assist with issues.

Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,I liked working there for the most part I didn't like most of the floor leaders. There were days when myself and others needed to clock into no seats and none of the floor leaders would let us.
good,A typical day at Convergys consisted of taking incoming calls from sales reps who needed assistance with customer credit applications. I reviewed credit applications and made decisions based on credit and their history with the company. Used excelled customer service and verbal skills to make sure the customers and sales agents were very satisfied with the my service. The most difficult part was working with large business accounts that had hundreds of accounts. It was hard telling the sales agent that this large company was extremely behind and did not qualify. Another difficult part was not being able to speak with customers. Customers would insist on talking to me and I had to used my best customer service skills to tell them I could not discuss their credit or decision with them.
good,"- Mostly Agent outsourcing biz, while I was in S/W R&D dep't"
good,Nice to not have to spend time or money comuting. Overall easy to work and get along with management and coworkers.
good,Always upbeat and easy to do. Co workers are amazing they can always help you. Management is starting to get everything organized properly.
good,I loved my co-workers and the support of the management staff in furthering my career with the company.
good,"Comprehensive training plan that offers continuous training throughout your employment, fun people and great locations. Answer inquiries about warranty, sales and service."
good,"Shift changes everyday, every hour. Learned human relations and pleasant communication."
good,"in this particular job it thought me to have more patient with people that needed help in understanding electronics, or just their monthly bill, and that not all people are the same and that they are human and make mistakes."
good,"Provided customer service for an average of 60 calls or more per day for the client ""directv ""resolved billing problems, order and installations issues handled taking supervisor calls when customer requested them from other reps and providing new product all that while maintaining a score card of time on or off the phone calls ,time percents of hold..

Guaranteed positive customer experiences and resolved all customer complaints. Communicated with vendors regarding back order availability, future inventory and special orders.Also have Work at home experience"
good,"Working there has been pretty fun and interesting. Team leader was always helpful. Only negative I could say would be the pay, for all the different things that agents do at their daily job at least there should be a significant raise or other ways of incentives, once again more subtantial than the ones they have. However, overall pretty good place to work."
good,"I've been working for Convergys for just over a year, but have been on the Cisco project since March 2012. Just like many call centers, there is a ""high school"" like atmosphere in many ways, but there are also the professionals who make the job worth while. My boss has been an amazing asset to my job, and I appreciate that much of the management is approachable and consistent. I do not like the insurance costs, and lack of quality of benefits. But when it comes to a job, Cisco project is a lot of fun."
good,"Learned alot about the pharmaceutical business. Our typical day consisted of answering approximately 270 calls daily. The job really wasn't difficult, I found it more enjoyable dealing with the patients and troubleshooting for the pharmacists and Dr.s offices. I truly enjoy communicating with the public, satisfying their needs."
good,"I loved the money, the people I worked around and the environment. My only complaint is being stuck at that desk for so many hours."
good,"Each day at work is a new experience. I always learn something new every day I am at work. I have learned how to deal with all sorts of customers such as irate customers, the nice and reasonable customers. Customers that speak another language. Customers that do not say much at all. I have experience talking to customers with disabilites through relay operators, TTY, and chatting online with the hearing impaired. The Managers are excellent in coaching us on our perfomance on phone calls. They go to extreme measures working to help us improve by buying learning tools, or providing awards to motivate us to improve. They keep our spirit up, which is important in this kind of work environment where all you do all day is sit at a desk. Co-workers are great too, I always have someone to ask for help when I need it. Hardest part of the job I would have to say is dealing with irate customers. Staying in a good mood can be difficult with some of these calls. Co-workers are also good for keeping your spirit up and cheering you up after these calls are finished. At times we get pretty busy which can also be difficult in having to leave notes on each account we open up. Most enjoyable part of the job is dealing with customers and being able to help them to the best of my ability. It is also nice when I can turn an irate customer's attitude around and have him laughing by the end of the call."
good,"Nice place to work, learned many things from colleagues."
good,"Convergys is a great job for customer service. After being taught there, I am cabable of any telecommunications job."
good,Really liked my job at Concentrix Corp. The people I I worked with day to day are wonderful. My job was transitioned to Concentrix in the Philippines. I was very disappointed l Iiked going into work each day.
good,• Ability to answer calls professionally
good,"A typical day on the job included studying about HIPPA policies and the guidelines we had to follow for being a pharmacy technician, also had to take calls from patients and directed them to where they needed to go, and preformed prescription refills and gave them prescription status'. Management was stable. They had a lot of employees to keep track of, and they did the best they could. But a need for more managers was in need. Co-workers, well you could tell who was there for the money and who was also there to try and put effort into the job. Had to be careful who you socialized with. The hardest part of the job was remembering the laws and keeping your patience with patients and patient family members when i couldn't disclose certain information with them. The best part of the job was the casual wear and laid back environment. It was work but the environment made it more comfortable for the long hours and the stressful days."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"a typical day at work is assisting customers needs being a direct point of contact and helping solving any disputes or problems. Always imporving customer service skills, I was a collections supervisor for may credit..work well with co-workers, The hardest part of the job is not being able to help a customer the most enjoyable part is being able to satisfy a customers needs."
good,A typical day at work was to promote TD bank and to sell products while helping customer's in a professinal manner with any problems or questions they may have.
good,The workplace itself is nice. The hours are varied and you typically sit all day.
good,This job is hard and very stressful. It can also be fun at times. So many diverse people working there.
good,"A typical day at work for me involves being of good cheer and having the will and knowledge it takes to help others. Whether it's providing excellent customer service or simple just assianting a disable client up a flight of steps, I enjoy the satisfaction I get from knowing I'm helping another in some way.I've learned through the years that I'm not going to know everything, but with the help of my team, (co-workers, supervisor, mangers,etc.) we can pull together and get any job done."
good,A typical workday at Convergys is good. I learned to use a lot of different systems and gave me experience through a call center. My co-workers are very helpful whenever I need help with difficult situations and there is always someone close near by. The hardest part is when the policies change all the time so it's hard to keep up with the changes. The most enjoyable part about the job for me is resolving peoples problems.
good,Answered inbound calls for Cingular Wireless customers Multi-tasked between 10-15 systems Offered a sale on every call
good,Best job I ever had on the sales end
good,On an average day I helped customers with their cable services ranging from internet to telephone services. I learned to be a better leader and enjoyed my job to the fullest.
good,- Decent pay
good,"Great overall company. Treats it's employees well. Management was approachable and easily accessible. Company was flexible with schedules if time was needed because of college, daycare, etc. Great, knowledgeable and friendly co-workers."
good,"answering incoming calls , leran how to sale new lins of busssiness, managed by a team leader,"
good,Early morning shifts.
good,By working here i have learned a lot about computer systems and programs and have been able to connect with people and to better communicate with others
good,My schedule did not add up to what they needed me to work. I was told that after 6 months I could change to day shift but they will not allow me to. I am working till 1am every night and weekends and with 3 boys I just cannot manage that.
good,"The workplace itself feels and breathes like a call center, day in and day out."
good,This job is good call center to start off at if you have never worked in a call center environment.
good,"A day at work here involved logging on to my computer, having about 10 second to get ready and then nonstop calls all day. Which is was, that's what I signed up for. The awful part about it was when you got a call that you couldn't help and when a manager came over to help you they told you they weren't able to help. It was awful seeing people stuck with 300+ dollar bills for activating a feature they didn't even know they had. But those calls were few and far between, so it wasn't all bad. A call center job is a revolving door so people were always in and out all the time. It almost felt like the managers were just people who had managed to work there for more than 6 months. But they had good hours and a great lunch room."
good,This company is an outsourcing call center and is almost always hiring. When you get a job with them you are pretty secure and they are actually not as strict as some other call centers (may vary on which project you work on). But the work is call center work so you need to sit for long hours and be fine with repetitive work. Also shortly after I joined this company they changed their policy on paying employees making it almost impossible to receive a permanent raise.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,First time that I have worked for a call center I would say that the company haves good intentions to make the employees job easy. Appreciate the company's point system to make the shift bidding fair. Two paid breaks and a 30min Lunch.
good,Friendly evironment Fun Place to work. Client oriented company that still is able to focus on employees.
good,"Company compare to others best in salary ,work time, Holidays , promotions , paper less work 70% work is easy full digital nice to work here.........."
good,You are train on what can happen on a call. Can more forward in the company quickly. Get so help with information that can benefit you. Are able to ask questions and get answers to for company interests.
good,The inside of the building is very modern with lots of colors and modern furniture the cafeteria has good food and a pool table. The job isn't so bad as long as you can over come the fact that people are sometimes going to call in and be angry but you gotta let it slide right off or you'll not succeed in this job.
good,"I love the job, it is very simple and laid back however, the commute everyday is taking a toll on me. I would like to find a job a lot closer to home."
good,Working at a fast pace and at the same time a fun working environment. They value their employees by providing fun activities to make work enjoyable..
good,It's a nice place and the people are always willing to help. But if you are used to standing or walking a lot in a job it's a some what difficult job to adjust to.
good,"Very fun and very productive, very competitive workplace, and everybody respect each other. A lot of fun and memories about this place. In this place I truly understand how to work as a customer service representative."
good,"Low pay salary but as my 1st job in Canada, it was not bad over all. I had great supervisor who was there most of the time when I needed any help or ant customer issues."
good,"While I would prefer more advancement opportunities, Concentrix is certainly a cool place to work - where you can work from home and select your schedule"
good,I have been with Concentrix for 4 years and I have received 2 promotions. This is a great company to grow within. I just wished they paid more money for the work that is having to be done.
good,"A nice place to work nice environment within teams"
good,"I was happy working at Concentrix, the staff are divers and helpful. My pears were team players which makes learning so much better.  the salary could have been better but still a great place to work."

good,It has been stable with a good support group.  I take customer service calls and work on offline projects.  Their is always opportunity for change or advancement.   Good management team.  I recommend it to any looking to start or get back into the work field.
good,"This company is a nothing but a call center with a great Microsoft process."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Needs improvement on how they handle situations like people going awol due to stress level from the management. They need to calm down or they'll lose more employees overnight. But other than that compensation and benefits meets the employees needs
good,"Answer phone and assist customers over the phone with any concern about telecommunication and up selling products. Providing knowledge and new products available. Troubleshooting with software and hardware concern over the phone when needed, Billing concerns and adjustments if necessary."
good,People are welcoming and management is good compared to other companies. We are provided with good incentives. Promotions are always available for agents
good,"Very Good place to start your career and a fun and productive place. The Salary compensation hike is not bad, It has there own products in Tradefree and Mobility."
good,I've never had too much of a problem working at Concentrix. I did enjoy the challenge of the first contract and that as long as you did your job the didn't give you a hard time and could get bonus. Management was cool and the culture was great. However we would be shuffled around contracts and some would not last very long. And the pay is only average.
good,Productive place for working. Salary offered is less compared to other companies. It is a good place to work. I enjoy my work here. I learnt more in this company.
good,"Lots of incoming calls"
good,"I would reccommend my friends to work with CNX, but with a good management of course. The benefits are good if you are already reguler employee. They really take care of you"
good,"The management is very helpful. Just the pay is not so great. The downside is the customers, some of them could be awful, awful people. There will be some who will make your day, but most are a pain in the neck. "
good,"I had a good experience with Convergys Alabang, I learned a lot specially how to communicate to others and how to proud yourself that you can perform."
good,"There is definitely job security at Concentrix and you are guaranteed to be able to work 40 hours a week with the chance of overtime plus benefits. Easy to schedule time off if needed and accruals of vacation time. Lots of company incentives to win extra days off, money, or other prizes."
good,"The employees are great! Hard working.Good starter job to get into. Job isn’t difficult but very fast paced"
good,"Happy to work with Management teams."
good,Loved this job the pay was just very low. The job takes a lot of patience but is over all nice company to work for. The job could at least pay 15.00 for the work we have to do.
good,"the benefits, allowance, and salary are all good but the work environment can be quite stressful. need to have excellent multi-tasking skills and goal-oriented. however, the management and staff are friendly and very helpful"
good,Learned how to digest structured process upon reviewing inquiries for healthcare providers. Has a good working environment and culture that seeks the highest quality of service.
good,The workplace was very intellectual and very cultural diverse. The hardest part of the job was honestly not the customers it was the staff. The most enjoyable where the incentives that the job provided to those who met monthly obligations for the client.
good,It’s definitely good for a seasonal job. Anyone has a good chance at scoring a job with this company. No benefits are offered for the seasonal position. Compensation is good for training and after training.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,It is a very fast paced company. You can be transferred to a different account once the need for the current account declines. The working hours depends on the client’s request.
good,"I have a very time working with convergys/concentrix. I love the ambiance, the people, the management. I learned so much from my experience, they taught me a lot especially in dealing with difficult situations."
good,"Provides great recognition and appreciation to its employees. "

good,"Concentrix is an excellent company that is for the most part willing to work with you and accommodate you when life happens. I've moved several times over the last three years and never had any issue with them. The managers are professional but also show that they are human and genuinely care about you as a person. However, they do keep the companies best interest. "
good,I really enjoy working over there. Great time to improve your communication and professional career. Everyone is super friendly but the only problem is the payment. Apart from that it is a nice team to work with.
good,"Nothing much to say, but I enjoyed my stay in Concentrix. Having my first BPO exp with this company helped me and pushed me to do great. Environment is much appreciated."

Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Even though clients come and go, this company earnestly does its best to keep employees.  If you're lucky you'll get good management, but sometimes that isn't always a guarantee"

good,Concentrix is customer support solution organization that truly empowers every person and organization it engages to achieve more. There opportunities for professional growth in Technical skills and customer service.
good,Amazing People to work with for the majority of staff. However has had issues in the past with new school leavers trying to treat it like a youthclub.
good,Productive Work Place. Every minute is billed and paid for. No time for interpersonal activities. Purpose driven company and work  place. Benefits are good. I like the personal space and skill oriented environment.
good,I would set up customers with new services and there appt dates and time. Hardest part was definitely the people around me it was way to loud and many different personalities.
good,"Durante mi tiempo en Concentrix Nicaragua logre potencializar mis aptitudes de liderazgo, resolución de problemas y crecer como una profesional en el área de servicio al cliente y manejo de cuentas a terceros. Obtuve el entrenamiento, el seguimiento y los planes de acción que me ayudaron a tener dos ascensos en corto tiempo. Dentro de la empresa también tenemos la oportunidad de ser "
good,"El ambiente puede ser un poco pesado en ocasiones, pero aún así brindan oportunidades para distraerse y continuar con sus labores."
good,The people around are approachable and knowledgeable about their work and is willing to help a colleague. Good ambience on the floor and clean environment.
good,"The average day is pretty much an average call center job. You take calls from customers, answer their questions, solve their issues, upsell if necessary, and try to meet your metric expectations every pay period. Once every two weeks or so, you'll probably have a team meeting and coaching."
good,Concentrix is a fast paced company. Can get a little over whelming at times with the frequent changes that the company is makes. Overall is a good company one that you can learn and grow to love. I myself stayed with the company for two years and learned a lot from the employers at Concentrix.
good,"Buona azienda, puntuale in tutto. Peccato solo per la poca stabilità che permette."
good,"Concentrix has taught me lots of customer service experience along with life skills, however the management and quota was a bit off; being punished for not up selling or being able to convince a customer of a sale can be discouraging to say the least."
good,"The work was easy, but the repetitive nature of the calls received as well as the focus on meeting sales goals eventually drove me away. If you can handle being hounded to meet sales numbers and have a general tolerance for a crowd of people constantly talking this place can be a reliable paycheck."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,El trabajo es muy monotono y rutinario pero el ambiente laboral es muy positivo
good,Fast-paced environment. Continued  Learning through consistency weekly coaching. Continued motivational programs and events. Recognition is strengthened.
good,Its fun to meet different types of people from different backgrounds. I always learn something new from them. They also challenged me when it comes with dealing conflicts.
good,Working with people who you've been with for several years and treated everyone as family is one of the most enjoyable part of my job. I left the company for several personal reasons.
good,Overall Covergys is an excellent company that provided ample PTO and UTO as well vacation days and health insurance. The vibe was interesting to say the least and was very sales oriented. They took care of their employees and the HR dept. was excellent. The only negatives was it was an endless stream of screaming customers like any call center is and they had minimum quotas you had to meet even though your job was technical service and billing.
good,Convergys is what it is. It's a good place to work. Good people there. It is a call centre environment where you are working for other large companies on contract.
good,"Working at Concentrix is good, they do have great management. They just are redoing many of the departments since they just new owners. They do reinforce attendance and the work efficiency."
good,I have altitude sickness and the commute up through the pass from Brigham City brought out my migraines. I had to pursue other employment off the mountain.
good,"The hierarchy works hard to keep their employees a float. The managers are educated and dedicated with the companies needs and desires, but sometimes you can see through people's sincerity when they're saying one thing but the intentions for their workers are not as sincere for success. Convergys is a call center and dealing with a lot of people calling in with different attitudes the managers need to be very supportive and consistent in their professional attitudes."
good,"It's a world wide multi national company all over the world having so many clients like HP, UHG, etc."
good,"Concentrix is good. The work place is beautiful. However, some of their computers in the production floor is hard to deal with but can still be worked around. The people here are nice too and they really aim for excellence."
good,"There were back to back calls that were rated on quality.  There were standards that expected to be addressed.  I was fun to try to do the best customer service possible and to meet all the standards during the call."
good,"I really liked working at Concentrix on the Intuit Turbo Tax account. There was always something new to learn, a varity of different issues to problem solve and  the people I worked with were some of the best coworkers. They were always helpful, team players and easy to work with. I missed working with them after the end of each tax season. It was challenging yet gratifing."
good,"To have place where agent can relax like spa."
good,"great learning experience, feel so prepared for any new management job i find! working a 40 hr work week, meeting with employees for an hour weekly, reviewing their calls, providing feedback, reprimanding if and when needed, and building great employees in the process! I learned how to properly handle irate customers and how to build employee moral."
good,How to be the best Onstar advisor and how to WOW the member. Met great people along the way. It was a very positive experience for me. Be safe out there!
good,Very driven place. You make sure you get your job done . I managed to clean two floors alone and would make sure everything was done the right way no matter how long it took.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"The company is great if you work short term, over time the company you start to feel that there is no real growth and you need to move on if you're looking to start in customer service I recommend it, but after time you will want to move on with the skills you learned."
good,"Every day I had to fix technical problems and financial problems to customer, sometimes the depends of situation or both same time, I learned to deal with any kind of customer, that depends of the temper, or how delicate was the situation, I had a good manager and my work place was good and enjoyable,  even when I had tough day I kept the calm and fresh mind for good solutions, my co-workers was the best part they were funny and loyal in every situation."
good,"A day typically starts with very high calls waiting. There, we have to answer all of those calls as fast as possible, which I think is very hard but quite challenging. And for me, that completes my day as a CSR."
good,The overall management of personnel is quite good. There are some issues of job securities. Shift timing don't get usually changes. But That is the nice place to work.
good,I love that company but process was not good. Growth opportunity is not so good. Some employees are working there from last 2-3 years but they did not get any growth opportunity.
good,Company gives the job security to employees. It is nice place to work here.Supportive environment and infra structure is good. Flexible shifts are here.
good,The pay is fair enough and they have many incentives.  Health benefit is great! You don't need to take home your work after shift. Plotted over-time is also paid.
good,"This job, it’s a really awesome job if you can deal with the customers and schedule. The schedule is something you can’t change or choose. But you can always ask days off or half days if needed. Good benefits. You just gotta be on the phones all day"
good,"Awesome company to get your foot in the door for customer service and tech support ."
good,"I worked with inbound customer calls. I enjoyed it very much, I had the opportunity to be able to talk to people all around the world. I had to help troubleshoot services which was a learning experience for me."
good,"I do appreciate those part of the management who takes time to listened with their employees and do extra miles. Their incentives are good. Although, the metrics changed a lot. The working  environment are great on my account. I cannot guarantee this to other accounts of Concentrix. Your collegues will help you."
good,"I learned to polish my customer service skills through many scheduled training and personal assessments with a team leader, and the other employees create a fun work environment."
good,"Being a call center agent is what I can say a very promising job. It's where you can find a lot of different kinds of people working on the same company. I can say promising cause, in a short while that I was able to work in that environment, I saw a lot of opportunity that may be able to use in the future as your edge."
good,"Good working environment, fun workplace. "
good,"I can say that if you are surrounded with good people, work can be very bearable no matter how hard it is. However, if the management is leading only woth their own personal interests, the needs of the employees will always be overlooked."
good,"The culture is winnng. The people are nice and there are a loy of opportunities for career advancement."
good,"i love this job, it was amazing and great, flexible for my home life. i would recommend people to work there. amazing expierence the benfits and the payroll is great aswell."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"The home office offers many volunteer opportunities for community involvement. The Jacksonville office has a large cafe with several meal choices. There are a lot of living spaces nearby, so it is possible to find something close to work for a short commute."
good,"Its a company with great workplace culture. It allows good discussions, and expressions of ideas. Good to begin a career and or pursue long term engagement."
good,"Very busy, fast pace organization.  I really enjoy helping people and knowing that I have made a difference.  The hardest part is being limited in being able to help.  "
good,"Pretty wonderful place to work. They're relaxed on personal time, but very strict on vernacular and time usage. I support their methods, it made for a well oiled machine."
good,daily troubleshooting and billing query . I learned a lot about troubleshooting tho im not tech savy. Management was great and the people on the work place are nice!
good,"productve and fun workplace, employees are treated as family, they provide security on their employees. however, there is a shifting schedule that without further notice to their agent."
good,"Great supervisor good environment . I had a great time at the beginning g but for me person, it began to be repetitive and boring at times. It was easy to excel over other employees I dont know if it was due to less training or experience, but it wasn't a challenge"
good,"Convergys is a great start for me to have my internship. Because of this, I am now familiar in the industrial/office setting. I am now more confident in interacting with other people."
good,"Management have improved and most of the managers now adopt the new respectful boundaries that Convergys endorses. The managers are almost all positive and the few managers who bullied staff seem to have disappeared, been demoted. There is one manager who is not quite in line and still practices a little one-to-one bullying when on-one is looking."
good,"Challenging work as customer service, but engaging and fun. Though the contract holder does not provide good information the management tries to find the most information for us to do the job properly."
good,"This job is an opprtunity to be fluent in customer service, credit card proccessing, and client relations."
good,"When I did work there it was a fun place to work"
good,Though a very well known name in BPO industry but it is bit difficult with work life balance. BPO operations in pressure environment. Job security under BPO operations is bit risky as client data security policy is strict.
good,"The workplace is conducive for working. I liked working there because the company pays well but the emotional and mental distress was the one thing that caused me to dislike working there. It really stems down to not having enough training to prepare us when it comes to  resolving customer issues once we are endorsed to productions already. It's like sending us to a battlefield sword less and armor-less. Otherwise, my stay with Convergys was overall a good experience."
good,"To set the standard in our industry through unparalleled care for our clients, customers, and people. Put customers first. We listen to understand their needs, we take ownership of problems and find solutions, and we go the extra mile."
good,"Assist members with their needs, use multiple computer applications to perform my job. Management worked with me when I lost my spouse to use both bereavement and pto time.  Various ages from just out of high school to retirees still needing or wanting to work. Hardest part of job is meeting quotas, while still adhering to quality.  Management is very friendly, and fair.  Would be nice if we could use our paid time off as either sick time or personal time, so we could avoid building up points."
good,Coaching Sessions are very effective but if you want to achieve something a lot of dedication and hardship. They will put you out of your comfort zone
good,I really enjoyed my coworkers and supervisors. Most of the calls taken were good. Some were fun. Some were challenging. But the rest all I can say is anonymity has its downside and it's ugly. In the end those calls were the proverbial straw that broke the camels back.
good,I enjoyed working at Convergys as it provided a challenging environment.  I met a lot great people that influenced my decision to continue my employment there for 19 years.
good,"good job, good place to work. full time around your schedule with an hour lunch was awesome would work again if i needed to return to the place of business"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Es una empresa con un excelente ambiente laboral que busca llenar sus vacantes internas con el personal activo.
good,"Convergys (CVG) is a place where they employ regardless of gender, age, race or religion. "
good,"Although I enjoyed my time here, the job itself becomes emotionally demanding; further, one feels completely drained at the end of the day following the eight hours of ceaseless calls. The management, teams, coworkers, and other staff were all great."
good,"En Concentrix enriqueci mis habilidades para trabajr en grupo, aprendi mucho sobre soporte tecnico de Windows. Mi jefe me daba reforzamiento cada semana y siempre teniamos dos recesos de 15 minutos cada uno y una hora de almuerzo. El area de recursos humanos siempre estuvo dispuesta para ayudar a los agentes y siempre querian innovar e implementar nuevas reglas a beneficio de sus empleados. La parte mas dificil del trabajo era poder obtener buenos puntos para ganarse el bono mensual ya que se basaba mas que todo en la duracion de las llamadas y debido a que los clientes no tenian mucho conocimiento de Windows tomaba mas tiempo atenderlos y satisfacer todas sus necesidades en una sola llamada."
good,"There are plenty of accounts to work on, I worked on AT&T;s customer service and billing. They focus more on selling than resolving the customers issues. They taught me how to sell products and get over objections. AT&T Account closed."
good,"The Company has a good culture and core values that makes the day to day work less toxic. I learned how to multi-task and do more to be at par with a higher standards set to be apart from others in the industry. "
good,I did learn a lot about Kaiser Permanente insurance.  I most enjoyable part of the job was working my colleagues. The manager I had was great and you were able to talk with him about any issues. The hardest part of the job would have been the call volume.
good,"Fun working with customer on the phone, helping people and solving problems. The community was great, always support available when you had a question. "
good,They provide you with on the job training to get you ready for the floor. They also give you benefits that are appealing. The only thing i didnt like was the floor management.
good,Had good camaraderie with fellow colleagues. They would value agent's feedback and would always have ideas for employees engagement. They know how to reward people by recognizing their hardwork thru employee engagement.
good,I enjoyed working with the managers and some of the employees at Convergys. The pay wasn't great but more or less fair for the work performed.I don't really have more details for this job but the system wouldn't let me submit this form without more details.
good,I could not work with better people. My colleagues are dedicated professionals. As a team we are disciplined and hard working. I owe a lot of this to the culture established by our HR partner.
good,Concentrix is a call center group that aims to please. There are stressful times when it comes to the metrics and amount of calls taken. They are trying to better the company.
good,Good company to start with for a fresher for someone looking forward to a career in the BPO industry. Salary scale not on par with others in the industry when it comes to an experienced professional considering joining the organisation. Incentives structure has remained the same for agents for more than a decade and needs to be revised even though targets have gone up for the last couple of years and have been acheived.
good,"Regular routine work."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,I like the benefits that Convergys has provided me for my one year of stay however I don't like the current  management. Job is so stressful and pressured.
good,"i enjoyed working for this company, very energetic employess around. supervisors were energetic as well, we played games inbetween calls to stay motivated and had weekly contests for incentives."
good,It is a good company with numerous opportunities to grow with in the company. Work culture is good. Most important thing is it is a very reputed company. So facilities are also big. Career growth is certain.
good,I was an agent but i was promoted to admin. Its a lateral promotion with a pay raise. There are not many opportunities to move from agent to anything else unless you want to move to another site. The location is kinda far though and it can make having a life outside of work hard. Its a really pen and accepting environment though. You wont find friendlier people anywhere. Benefits are good if you take advantage of them.
good,A good place to start your career and a great BPO company to experience a lot of things to start your career. Manage was great. the hardest part of the job was getting through the customer about their bills of their account. i enjoyed most of the part of where I helped the customer to his/her satisfaction.
good,The company gives a good training for the employees. Working with the company will give you all the skills for all types of job that you need to handle. The hardest part of the job is the changing of shifts.
good,"Convergys is an overall great place to work at. The employees are very nice, management is very nice and understand about ""life situations"" I would recommend anyone to work there,"
good,We were a family. I loved the account and the people i worked with. The company taught me well in terms of providing excellent customer satisfaction. It was a learning experience for me.
good,"it was fun, the co-worker interact a lot and have a lot of fun, the also have a playroom with a playstation 3 and xbox 360, bu also they were very strictly about the work too"
good,"At Convergy's, I learned a lot about patience. When dealing with patient/customers whom are experiencing difficulty with prescriptions, as the middle man, one learns to be slow to anger."
good,HAving cvg as my first bpo is an honor. Cvg really is a good company with good people it is just that compensation is not enough and the distance will not work with me as well
good,"Pretty good job for anybody who is okay with working a job requiring to sit 8 hours straight doing 200-300 calls a day. It's a good job, get to learn new things if you're not familiar with pharmaceuticals and such. The downside to the job is not enough training and management can be...questionable at times. For me, I only had two weeks of training. It's not enough to completely cover every scenario, which can get stressful sometimes, and I tend to get chewed out from the supervisors from time to time. Calls can get stressful at times, but other than that, it's a pretty okay job."
good,"need to make a lot of calls throughout the day, I learned how to be more helpful, how to cater to the customer more. Everyone is friendly on the floor. The hardest part of the job is fast pace, you got to keep calling people. The most enjoyable is you get prizes when you do good."
good,Everyday at work is a routine and full of challenges. I've learned to go out of my comfort zone in terms  of learning new things. I love the management as there is always proper channeling and communication between the employer and the employees. People are fun in the workplace. Hardest part  of the job is learning challenging and new things but at the same time enjoyable.
good,"Company has good account that can definitely give you an idea that its for long term. The work will really depend on the employee since the campaign that Im in, most did not meet the requirements of the clients so a lot of them were not given a chance to continue. Client are really strict on house rules together with the metrics. Reason for staying will be the people that you are working with and the account itself."
good,typical day consists of retention calls in a fast paced environment with friendly co workers and management. Benefits and compensation are reasonable for the type of work.
good,"Average Salary Range - Entry Level for some"
good,"A great job for entry level employees, a lot of potential for growth. Its overall a great job, must be able to multitask and maintain professionalism under pressure"

I just have that you HAVE to sale to work here because trying to sale an irate customer cable is almost impossible but hickory convergys does NOT think so!"
good,"Job security is an issue, however working in a call centre this is to be expected; clients can pull a campaign with hardly any notice. However Concentrix do offer a reasonable last pay of 2 additional weeks; plus any annual leave owed to you."
good,"Tienen muy claro que para que un empleado sea feliz, necesita facilidades, descansos y actividades."
good,"No real complaints.  Good company, was well looked after.  Direct manager wasn't trustworthy and never transparent.  Other than that, was a fantastic situation."
good,"Good place to work, good management, good working environment. Great break room  and game room for employees. Management plan events for the employees to keep the atmosphere excited."
good,this is a great company. the benefits are the worst that i have come across for such a big company and the pay for the project that i was on should have been higher given we had to do so much
good,"Was a good company to work for, fast-paced and competitive. management was supportive and helpful, good training process, felt wee trained for my position"
good,"I started working there as a phone agent, I was able to advance to the Chat department. It was wonderful, until it wasn't. The company who we had a contract with would change things without warning. The chat department was switched programs, and after about a month of being on the new program was dropped suddenly."
good,I enjoy my time working in the company. Benefits are good and supervisors are good in handling team. They also have website where you can use your points gained in selling products to redeem other products like vouchers and more.

good,My experience with concentrix as my first customer service call center job has been very interesting but I enjoy helping others and I like the overall environment and culture of the job.
good,"Great company, moral can be a huge factor in how a site succeeds. Fast paced, lots of room to be promoted. Calls are usually back to back and metrics must be met"
good,This is a work at home job. You have to have a lot of self motivation to get up and be logged in to the phones on time. I like the job because I am able to help people with issues. I am still working for this company.
good,"manageable together with the activities outside the office and also within the office. Having fun activities to ease stress level. we are also have a R&R to recognize the top performers, family day at least once a year, dealing with great offer of our HMO provider,"
good,"I enjoyed my job and thought highly of my supervisors and manager.  The only problem was they had a guy doing scheduling and he would change your schedule every 2 to 3 months.  I am a single mom and it was very stressful trying to find daycare to adapt to my constant work hour and day changes.  This job is perfect if you don't have children, family or any other commitments. If it weren't for the inconsistency with work hours, I would still be working there."

good,"So a typical day at Convergys, you have a set time to be there, you can only clock in 5 min early. If you try to clock in sooner then 5 min the system will kick you out. Then you have 5 min to get all your programs up and running that you plan on using for the work day.

good,"No power-tripping bosses, approachable support, very transparent company, but there are so many disputes regarding incentives. HR department needs improvement"
good,"I have gained enormous knowledge about corporate world"
good,"My review for the Company of Convergys was a warm feeling, since the employees and employers treat each other as if ""we"" were family and express that thought throughout the day"
good,Convergys is family. But salary is business. Good training environment. Account is not toxic but high volume of calls. Salary can't compensate my family's needs.
good,The company is a great outstanding company. It had several different companies so when one company ended a contract and did not renew you would not be without a job you would simply train and be placed in another existing department inside the Convergy's Corporation.
good,Convergys was a great work environment. Training is paid. The only thing I disagree with and don't think is fair is our shift bids. We shouldn't have to decide what our schedule should be based on policy. We should be able to choose our own schedule because you are most likely to show up to work when you choose what is best for you.
good,"*after buying Stream, the salary is streamlined but it is much lower than Stream"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Honestly not a bad place to work just the goals and shifts are not always the best, like most call centers. The people who work there are great as well as many of the bosses."
good,Nice place to work with lot of benefits of achieving goals. Work atmosphere is good. Helpful colleagues and incentives not at par with huge multi nationals.
good,"This is a great place to work if you like people. The workers were helpful and friendly. I made friends I will keep forever. My direct supervisors wanted me to succeed. Some focused on stats more than development, but they meant well. the biggest down side was the compensation.  They only give raises once a year and it is based on a random stat.  probably the stats that costs them the least.  They claim it is easy to get promoted, but it is not."
good,You answer phone calls and take orders for directv. You suggestive sale and make a bonus off the sale. Easy job if you have patience. You can pick up hours for over time.
good,It was a very nice moment when we were working in that company. Employees were given a lot of care and many festivals were also made in our company.Very fun activities were being done and all the employers were working very freely in the company without worrying and I do not think there would be such a company on Kolkata which is getting freedom like a minacs company. Thanks you
good,"The company have an employee engagement system that is being observed monthly and annually with incentives."
good,"Convergys has great management Personnel, Willing to work with workers. I have learned sales, how different products work by having hands on training,"
good,With the BPO boom in the mid 2000 it was a place which would get you first hand experience of being a robot (pun intended). after attending to over 200 calls a day saying almost the same things over and over again it actually challenges you and makes you interact with people from all corners of the world.
good,"""Friendly and encouraging work environment"" Amazing work culture, they take good care of employee and there requirement. should correct the salary as per the standards."
good,"Its a great place to work, work life balance is there. Can manage the work on day to day basis. Management support is there all the time and we can get to learn minimum things."
good,My experience is very good.it is all day shift including three breaks.i m one of the top performer.work environment is good with supporting staff.the most enjoyable part when i resolved my customers query.
good,"The team leaders and Supervisors are amazing. They were encouraging, supportive and tried to create a great working atmosphere. Agents come and go, but you can advance if you have the ambition to do so."
good,"Best place to start on with your career. Gives you enough of exposure and required guidance to improve your skills in exchange and Office 365. "
good,"Convergys is a good place to work at, people are nice and friendly. an employee will really see the support team working hard.however, career advancement is too slow."
good,"They pay handsome salary to freshers however there is no gradual increase in salary of employees over the period of time and even after doing hard work you would not get that much incentive, as incentives are very low in this company."
good,Offers both uto and PTO. As well as holiday and paid vacation. Offers of full-time schedule with bi-weekly pay with room for overtime. Floor support whenever you need it
good,working with concentrix is very good i have learned a lot of thing in concentrix  the management is very good work culture is very cool. the managers are very co operative.
good,"I have to best team Leader possible, she is awesome and make it worth while to be at Convergys. It can be very busy with calls and then it can be slow."
good,"This workplace had a good environment. it had a poor level for advancement due to favoritism within, this place allow you to have married couples as supervisors, floor management as Mother and Daughter, agents such as family members, dad , mom.. it goes against other workplace where they wont allow relatives to prevent workplace abuse of power. "
good,"sad that the site closed, it was a great place to work, enjoyed the other people that worked there, liked how close it was to my home, seven-minute commute, hated the parking lot and catwalk, learned a lot about different systems, the hardest part of the job was when the systems went down,"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"I have working for 1 years and 3 months I enjoyed a lot to work here as well as management are good they are always ready to your concern, I always recommend to all of you to work in this company and get good exposure for your life."
good,"Convergys is a solid workplace with ever changing sales benefits,though they have moved away from a customer service objective to a sales objective and that just doesn't agree to what I had originally signed up for."
good,The company has a good environment. People are easy to be with but the hardest part is how to balance time. Because I have to adjust when it comes to my sleeping hours. But incentives are really good.
good,Sometimes stressful but the team leads are supportive. I learned a lot of things in convergys and they appreciated my effort when it comes to work. And i'm really thankful to experienced that kind of work.
good,The working atmosphere was very good. the Team leaders and the management was very supportive and helpful to the employees. i learned the punctuality over their. the culture of work place was friendly. the hardest part of the job was work load at month ends and the most enjoyable part of the job was easy works.
good,Work environment was very chill and relaxed.No issues with management nor fellow coworkers. Work was at time over baring. But it was also fairly easy to get the help needed.
good,A lot of new changes implemented in the company change from Minacs to Concentrix. Leadership is more stable cleaner look with the new change to make the work environment more suitable for work production and still be comfortable. Some adjustments can still be made to make the environment more professional and also a wider range of positions for more opportunity to expand in other areas.
good,Convergys is one of the pioneers of call centers/bpo industry in the country. They will handle you well as an employee and you will never think twice in joining such a professional environment
good,"The organization's culture is conducive to learning, and provides an open environment to share your ideas, and implement them too. Good for those who want to learn and innovate. Not a 'pay master' though."
good,"Workung here has been an amazing journey. I have learned a lot of things which made me the person I am today. Though schedules are hectin, I can say that it made me a well rounder person and easily adjust to whatever life throws at me."
good,"Busy and productive everyday, happy co-workers, approachable supervisors, gives you the best job experience or internship, good working environment, comfortable workspace"
good,There's always activities to  break the work routine  performers are being awarded. Leadership on-going trainings. The recruitment process was organized well and the training schedules.
good,"It is a good company. They have day shift available, it is a people friendly. They have a good paying job. They value people and clients. Scorecard focused."
good,The company itself is wonderful. It is the account that is hard and needs your full attention. Company benefits are way beyond your expectations. You just have to learn to balance your time.
good,Always meet new people to communicate with and help them solve issues. Come to enjoy the culture with lot of people working with. Fun going out with co-workers after work.
good,"I have learned a lot about my skills and opportunities. Because of my job, I've acquired good skills in English and communication. I've also learned good customer service."
good,"Working for Convergys has helped me to gain experience as an advisor right through to team manager, working with blue chip clients and also supporting advisors"
good,"Working in Convergys India , as a fresher was great experience.The training and management was well organised and experienced in handling in different situation."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Convergys provides you the platform to perform at your best abilities and enhance them at the same time. Open forum to discuss new ideas and on time promotions.
good,They do not focus on employees they just focus on more and more production. Its just like work and go home. You get the salary which is lower than the market standards and there is no fun at work. Not at all
good,"Convergys is as very enjoyable job to have however it is not in the career path i would like to go down. My role is to help customers resolve their problems with a high customer service standard, and rebuild trues between the customers and EE."
good,This is a fun company Convergys has proven to be a fantastic place to work. I am not currently employeed and they have taken care of me greatly. There is always help when i need it and great advancement opportunity.
good,Ambiente de trabajo internacional. Gente joven. Mucho compañerismo.
good,This job is great it easy to do and very fulfilling however it isn't an equal opportunity provider and i think that would be due to staff rather than the company itself .
good,"Its a good company, just has to work for your life balance. Alot of benefits come with the company being my first call center it is great experience in work force."
good,"Minacs/Concentrix is a typical place to work, meaning it had a big turnover for employees.  It made it hard to learn new things because of being pulled back to cover phones."
good,I enjoyed working for concentrix. The Team Leaders were great and they really promoted people being moved up in the company quickly. Unfortunately the pay isnt the greatest so i decided to pursue other opportunities
good,Convergys is a company that has a continues learning program. They have ways on how to make their employees become best if not better at what they do. They provide constant training that will help their agent be their best at all times.
good,Company only paid a portion of what you were worth since they outsourced for other companies. Could work for the parent company and make much more money.
good,Good company to work with. Just the management can be a bit better. I am working with this company for the last six months and the experience is quite good.
good,I had a lot of fun working at Convergys when the management was more relaxed. After it became 60% of our job to make sales it instantly became an overwhelming amount of stress. The management are wonderful people and like to help you out when you need it. I also didn't like all of the mandatory overtime every single month.
good,"answering phones, having meetings and solving problems for our customers. Patience.  management was always checking in seeing how we were doing what we need and how to make the job better. having to change what I was doing due to the contract being lost.  Working with people and great coworkers"
good,Ok not bad environment but management never trust their employees. As well as their is no value for the people who work over there and also they support only those who is in favor for them and the management.
good,I enjoyed the culture and helping people on a daily basis. I love the high energy call center environment and friendly people. Overall it is a great company to work for.
good,"A typical day in Convergys consists of launching multiple systems to manage many accounts, attending the morning brief to find out what the company needs from me on that day then we go to our desks and begin following leads, creating leads and answering inbound calls for based on business to business sales.  "
good,"I work with a team of 15 Support Engineers and 2 Escalation engineers. "
good,"giving resolution to the customer's concern."
good,"Nice company with healthy environment. It was a wonderful experience to work there. I have learnt many things from the organization like selling, time management, dealing with clients and many more."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Manejo de herramientas con responsabilidad, buen entrenamiento, relaciones interpersonales, excelente ambiente laboral. El proyecto en español cierra el 03/30/2017 por eso no continuaría trabajando en la compañia."
good,"Lot of work, Scope of learning how to interact with different people But no time to do any other activity."
good,My experience working at convergys was great. It was a friendly environment which didnt have me feel intimidated when starting. Overall it was a good work experience.
good,Immense learning and the management is extremely supportive. Its an open door policy which allows employees to speak their mind freely. Feels great to be a part of this Organization.
good,company is good with proper management system. there are some days when we had to work on full day without any breaks looked in to 8.5 hours in system.here i learned about how people react and worked under pressure and know how to complete targets with in a particular time. here we also do lots of fun activities specially on friday which we call fun friday
good,"en la cuenta en la que labore en concentrix se manajaba un excelente equipo y ambiente de trabajo, como en todo lugar tiene sus pro y contras, mi horario de madrugada me permitia estudiar mientras laboraba lo cual hace que el plus sea bastante grande sin embargo muy cansado. puede mejorar en evaluaciones"
good,"Its great to be a part of such a Brand that provides the good culture. "
good,"- Management is supportive."
good,A great addtion to the learning curve. vast client base. chance to explore various customers. timely reimbursement of incentives..chance of growth a high too
good,"It was tiring, but fun and great at the same time. I've learned a lot of things there and it nurtured my career and provided me enough experience, even though it was only for a few months."
good,"Being able to work in a call center made me more open to different kinds of people with different personalities. It taught me how to deal with unexpected situation. I love my colleagues. They motivate me to work hard. The hardest part of my job was the changing of schedule every month from night shift to day shift and I have to adjust with my sleeping cycle every month. The best part of being in a call center is hanging out with your colleagues. You get to go out of town, party and mingle with your friends which is really cool."
good,Just t just breathe and keep it moving. ....its not always bad you meet some of the most interesting subscribers as well as co- workers. .its just like amy other job..its not perfect.
good,"I have really enjoyed work at Convergys, they have a good policies in place, and great management. I have been able to put into practice several things that I have learn in my academic carrier."
good,Good work environment...could be more flexible with school schedules or family emergencies.  Training could be more extensive...but overall a good place to work
good,"Working from last 9 years need a change. Joined at WFM MIS EXECUTIVE LEARNT ALOT"
good,That company was the great. The insfrasture of the company is very good. I have learned many things and many lessons from that company.
good,Overall a good and productive work place. Good infrastructure and facilities. Management and hr team is not up to the mark. No work pressure. Overall a fun place to work.
good,"fun workplace and friendly environment, lots of good people. good stepping stone for career beginner. the management's are so approachable and you will not feel being left out."
good,"The training is not particularly good but after a month or two on the floor you will generally have the hang of it and it becomes an easy and often stressful job. Management is pulled from agents, often a little too quickly and they often don't have enough training either. Security can be a problem with contract loss but they do go out of their way to keep employees and move them to other contracts if possible. A good boon is you never get called in, shifts are constant and steady and when you go home work stays at work."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Convergys is a great place to build your customer service skills, starting as an agent and then moving forward if you are interested, you will interact with different cultures all the time and make some good relations with your coworkers."
good,"The job itself isn't hard. I worked in BBWC doing welcome calls. My only issue with that department is our job is not to sell products but focus more on setting up accounts, but we still have metrics to meet as far as our sells, which I don't understand. The benefits are good, the management is okay as far as team leads. The management higher than the TLs is pretty perfect. They'll listen to your needs and work with you as much as possible and resolve any issues you're having pretty fast. The pay is good, the commission is also good. The only thing about commission that I truly loath is if the whole department doesn't meet its numbers, NO ONE gets their commission. That truly gets on my nerves because my money shouldn't depend on everyone else's numbers, but it's not as bad as I'm making it sound. We normally meet the numbers each month. "
good,It is a good place to work with. It offers opportunity and career growth even to non-graduates. You have to adapt to changes though.
good,Beginning of Carreer with Concentrix is the good Platform to learn new things both Technical and functional in well orgainsed manner
good,I Had learned a lot about the sale at ATT and Helping customer found the best solution to fix the problem. Learning different products to sell to the customer's
good,"Convergys has provided work life balance by adding activities that are out of line from our usual operations. this is to ensure that employees get to enjoy our stay in the company."
good,"The management is actually strict when it regards to customers information. Training's are knowledgeable, Communication skills are surely enhance as well as direct supervisors are very helpful."
good,every one is tired of hearing complaining customers but if you know how to get on their good side and put those numbers up is easy and great time with commission and company events
good,"A typical day at work for me consist of completing and sending reports, checking attendance greeting my team and at times putting out fires. The management team is solid and the break area is adequate at best. "
good,typical day is very busy it was a call center. Received min. of 60 calls a day. And also had to do some training for new employees
good,you would come in log in your computer and all your programs that you would need for the day.Members would call in about various questions regarding there medicare benefits.The managers and team leads where very helpful in any questions that we had. I learned a lot about insurance mostly about medicare and the process of reading claims info. I really enjoyed the friendly work environment and getting to talk to different people everyday.
good,First job but I learned so much from the company. The experience was nice and the knowledge and learnings will surely help me in my everyday living.
good,"One of my all time favorite places to have worked! Opportunities for advancement are there, I was promoted twice in first year. Great management group who care about developing and rewarding their teams."
good,"It's my first time in the BPO industry and Convergys have given me a lot of reasons why it is a good decision to work in a call center. Although my health struggled a lot due to difficulties in adaptation, I never regret that I worked in this company."
good,"Great experiences.  They are the result of inspired thinking and design that tranforms the mundane into something memorable. they offer their employees excellent benefits to support their professional and personal growth and well being. However, salary does not satify my needs."
good,I was working as an quality advisor in Convergys. I had a nice time and it was a friendly environment to work with. My job role was to audit calls and provide feedback to agent in lacking areas.
good,TJ's is a great place to work. There is a fun atmosphere and caring employers. They are very helpful and not afraid to work themselves to get the job done.
good,"busy, fast paced environment with many opportunities for hard workers. job requires you to deal with many different personalities of people and how to deescalate customers. Team Leaders are very approachable and willing to help anyone succeed in the industry.  there are several different break rooms, lounges, and a cafeteria available to every employee. hardest part of the job is hours are not very family oriented. best part of the job is all the benefits that are available to every employee."
good,"great place to work however with hundreds of jobs lost with 2 weeks notice there was not very much job security, however the management and advisers working there create a great atmosphere"
good,Challenging but a very knowledgeable workplace. i have learned a lot from this company and it helped me improve my communication skills and taught me various things in providing excellent customer service.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Overall good. Work life is good, growth is less enough. Have to work hard to go up to the level. safety of women is considered to the core.Its a productive place to work in."
good,Great working environment and management was helpful when able to be reached. Benefits and company policies were easy to understand and forthcoming. Loved the workplace culture and the incentives Convergys applied. Hardest part of the job was when people were upset and calling in. Most enjoyable part was when the computers went through random system issues.
good,I've learned a lot if new things. Especially when it comes to customer services. a better understanding on how to communicate well with every customer. understand their culture and respect each other. Our trainers provided us a lot of helpful things that definitely we can use not only in our job but also to our everyday life. I enjoyed working with my teammates and trainers. The most enjoyable part of the job is the Mac calls scenarios. The hardest part is always be active and travel everyday.
good,The work setting is relaxed just as well as the dress code. Has a strict rule in regards on what can be on the production floor.
good,I worked here twice..first time was dreadful but after a while it was alright. I made many friendships and met many people. Work enviroment was great just the job itself kind of sucked. Having to deal with whiny customers and pretending to care is not something I'm used to.
good,"Apart from the long and sudden changes in the shifts, the experience was quite nice. The best place to start with if you wish to excel in the BPO industry."
good,"Gran ambiente laboral, y muchas opciones de crecimiento, fue una de mis primeras experiencias, le brinda muchos entrenamientos para estar preparado."
good,"My experience at Convergys Thane was good.My job was to help Australian customers in solving their problems related to Dial up "
good,A very good company to learn and start your career with. Package is less but work environment is fabulous. Growth is guaranteed if work hard. Personal and professional life balance is present
good,"Convergys es una increíble y flexible empresa, tiene un ambiente tranquilo y social, sin embargo el crecimiento personal es bastante limitado. Para una persona que le gusta ser más dinámica y proactiva en más de un ámbito laboral, convergys no es precisamente la empresa indicada.  Convergys es la empresa indicada para quien busca estabilidad y flexibilidad."
good,Great band to work with but no life remaining as 24*7 shifts and don't get time for yourself. Everything is sorted in CVG. Loved working 4 years there.
good,I started with Convergys and after graduating from training. I was on the production floor for only a month before getting promoted to the Trace Department
good,The benefits are good so as the people working in the company. They are all polite and fun to be with however the rules and grading system of the work is not that fair.
good,"Very flexible work hours"
good,"The company invests in training, good facilities and people engagement."
good,"Concentrix is one of the best to work,according to me.My Expirience of working over here is very good.The management is very good.This company provide us the job security too."
good,"Answering phone calls from the U.S. Providing the best option to the customer and giving the best service. Graveyard schedule. CO-workers are fun to be with, teamwork is the key and commonly known for their large eye bags. Hardest part or should i say most challenging part is to hit the metrics to get commission. The most enjoyable part is when you hit the metrics for the commission and talking to kind foreign customers."
good,"Una empresa seria y responsable, con muchos beneficios."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"On a typical day, the job isn't for everyone. The job is very stressful and the turnover rate is high. They hire full time and there are benefits but the pay could be better"
good,"On a typical day, I take calls within my working hours and have my breaks on a given time. My day revolves around with my co-workers chitchatting about events that happened withing the week."
good,"It's great for fresher to start up their career and also yes they pay great compared to other companies. The work place is fun, the manager's are helpful, the cafeteria is one of the biggest cafeteria I have ever seen in the organization and yes overall its a great place to work and also yes the working environment is great."
good,pretty good job to get experience in meet a lot of people during training but a lot of sitting through out the day just taking call after call no breaks if busy but other than that you do get a 30 minute break.
good,"Hard working people, good team spirit across all functions. Recognition and rewards are good. Good chances of growth if you are a fresher. You can see the steady pace in all departments. You'll make a lot of good friends."
good,"work was fulfilling as well"
good,"Monitoring calls and providing feedback to agents"
good,"System glitch, delayed salary due to system merging, slow internet connection, Team leader and regular TSR are secretly involved in wrongdoing-connivance-"
good,"you always meet really nice people along the way, its rewarding because they your performance is good, you get prizes or money! thats in top of monthly commission + referral bonus"
good,Convergys was a great place to work. I learned valuable lessons about being organized and time management. My coworkers were amazing and always friendly and sociable.
good,"The company is good, depending on the team or department lead if they will be treating employee's fairly, no bias and will not depend if the employee is close to the boss when it comes in deciding whom to promote to an specific position."
good,the only here is when you have disputes it will be back very very long time and for back he dont care how many have you been working for them.! Good management team good people to work with.
good,It was great being at Convergys. We looked forward to a new day. I hada great time with my coworkers and my management gave me a lot of support and encouragement.
good,"I liked working at this job because I was good at my work so I reaped the benefits handsomely when payday came around. In regards to the Job culture, I believe they let anyone work here for the most part, which can be a good and bad thing, As with almost every call center in america the people are very negative and most people are just here to get the hourly pay not even attempting to get the commission bonuses, I think most people thought they were unreasonable and unattainable. But I loved a challenge. The management team is pretty competitive and do what they can to keep it lively. Be careful however because they can be underhanded sometimes in regards to competitiveness and they definitely have favorites. Attendance is very important here. If you can stay consistent they will work with you and pay you well. Oh! They love to promote from within"
good,"scheduling is my biggest concern "
good,"Tive oportunidade de conhecer muitas pessoas, inclusive fiz algumas amizades lá. A empresa prezava bastante pelo trabalho em equipe e pela diversidade. Em contrapartida, nos 5 meses em que estive lá, fiz parte de uma equipe por onde passaram 4 líderes, onde um deles não refletia a mesma animação e empatia dos demais colaboradores, mas isso é apenas um caso isolado. "
good,"Walking through the open doors was a breath of fresh air, great company really upset that I left. The trainers were fun and didn't feel accomplished until you learned the information."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,I never thought that working in BPO Company would be fun and exciting untill CVG hired me. They have a very tidy work place and engaging programs for their employees.
good,"Working as a windows technical support is a challenging job as you will be talking to different kind of people and help them troubleshoot their issues on there windows but it is very ful filling once the issue was fixed and you know that you provide the best customer services experience to them. What i have learned on my job as a technical support is to be more patient as we are handling different kind of persons, time management as we have fix the issue in a timely manner and also to be a better and wiser person. It makes me easier to work as my co-workers is fun to be with and they're like my second family. The hardest part of the job was handling an irate customer but i was able to resolve there issues in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is when you know that all your efforts was paid off when you see that your customer is happy with the kind of service you are providing to them and of course when the people around you helps you to be a better person, that was priceless."
good,"Will get much time to learn about the product and Process. Very friendly atmosphere and helpful. Management providing cab facility, entertainment,food Festival from management."
good,"Great place to work if your looking for diversity.... Great learning experience. With a job like case management you will know with in the first week after training if this type of job is for you. Plenty of opportunities for advancement and plenty of overtime to be had. Varied shifts, so there's same thing for everyone. Also Great insentives."
good,"Having great experience with concentrix (Google) . Have learned lots of things like Google adwords , how google earn money ? , What's main motive of Ads and how to create these ads . Management and Co-workers are supportive ."
good,"The account that I'm with now is a new account for Concentrix, hence it's a more challenging one than what I had from my past account which is a Bank based in the United Kingdom."
good,"Working with convergys is always a delight."
good,"awesome workplace. great co workers and managers, basing on my department. convergys is an awesome workplace. the hardest part of the job was the shifting of schedules. aside from that, everything is okay. the most enjoyable part, team building."
good,I really enjoyed working at Convergys but when we change to At&t they started messing up with pay.  The benefits is great.

As in team, we cooperate together go get the best option on how to solve the problem that we might sometimes cant handle it individually. We also actively communicate each other and share any new knowledge and best practice.

I will never forget all those friend who are my customers in Australia and New Zealand. I wish that i will visit them one day. It's hard for you if you make relationship with your job but the end of the day you has to leave it."

Upbeat uplifting attitudes taht mad for a very productive work enviroment"
good,I had a lot to recover during my time at Covergys. I was recovering from an abusive relationship as well as a medical condition and grieving the loss of a family member in addition to adjusting to being back in Canada after three years living in a foreign country.  I was overwhelmed easily by the kindness of others. The strong community made healing and recovery possible to move forward to accomplish my dreams and move forward with other goals and achievements.
good,I loved working for this place unfortunately it's no longer meeting my needs as far as the scheduling. I would like to work in this field but there must be adjustments made such as training payments.

good,"Como todos los centros de contacto o call centers, se presentan  de una forma muy llamadora, pero una cosa es lo que ofrecen a lo que ellos realmente le quieren dar a la gente, buscan cualquier excusa para no darle las bonificaniones a la gente que trabajaron por obtener las mismas."

good,"Very easy to learn job, not a bad job at all. many advancements. but not a lot of pay difference for advancing. have made great friends with co workers and generally everyone there is nice and supportive"
good,"It is very self-fulfilling and self-motivating when you know that you were able to assist and help someone with just simply doing your job. But doing an extra mile would be much more especially if you get recognition/s and knowing that the one you helped has been thankful enough for what you've done for them."

I've learned many different personalities. I've learned how to make irate customers become less irritated when they talk to me. Management is very good."
good,"I worked as a technical support representative, my job is to fix issues and manage frustrated customer, and in behalf of that, we are required to sell, and we are required to satisfy them, but how could I do it if our access is very limited."
good,"Very busy place to work in and very active schedule where weekends required, too much to do with so little time for information updates"
good,"The most current role I held at Convergys was technical support for AT&T Wireless. The typical workday involved answering questions and educating customers on data usage or other issues.

I also had opportunities to be a mentor for new employees which I enjoyed very much."

good,"A typical work day was Customers calling us upset that their service were out. We had to find a solution either over the phone, send a technician, or new equipment. The most difficult part of the job was dealing with customers that angry and yelling at you even though you were not the cause of the problem. The best part were my co-workers that became my friends, we stay in contact now even after I left the country."
good,"* Its was Good to Work with Concentrix.ihave learnt Many things from there like pantuality,seriousness towards life."
good,"BUW ist ein netter und zuverlässiger ArbG, die Kollegen sind sehr herzlich und man wird mit offenen Armen empfangen und kann die Kollegen jederzeit Fragen stellen. "
good,"I would take inbound calls for customers whom were having issues with the cable, phone, or internet. Troubleshooting was the main idea for all issues, but if non could be fix then I would send out a truck for service. I've learned how the network of cable actually works when having troubleshooting issues. Management was helpful in each field. Co-workers sort of stayed to themselves getting task done. Hardest part of the job was when your not able to fix a customer's issue due to a tragic incident that only tech operators can resolve. Point system, overtime offered consistently played a major view in this job."
good,"Concentrix is a call center contractor that works for multiple company's to take incoming calls that the parent corporation is unable to take and contracts out for various reasons.

I learned how to sent customers Emails to confirm certain information that the customer wanted. Some of the supervisors were really helpful and tied to keep me updated of my progress weekly. It is a friendly environment my co-workers were also very helpful when the supervisors were unavailable. Supervisors recognize the agents' hard work by handing out recognition certificates and awards. The hardest part of the job would be trying to keep a call from escalation to higher authority; for example my supervisor. I would have to be very patient with the customers that insisted in obtaining more than what was able to be given to them. The most enjoyable part of the day was getting compliments from the customer for being patient and helpful."
good,"A very tiring day due to heavy call volume assisting card members to make a payment on their credit cards, all their concerns. I think the hardest part of my job is to stay professional despite of them saying inappropriate words. and the most enjoyable part of this job is you just loved what you're doing."
good,"When you come to work, all you mostly do is answer phones and questions from customers calling in with concerns or issues. They teach you all the resources you need and show you where to find answers for other questions that may be asked. The on-the-floor management team is great and usually do their best to make it a less-stressed work environment. The pay is on the low end of the spectrum compared to other companies who have their representatives in same or similar positions. In the limited amounts of time you are able to talk to your co-workers, you can end up making long term friendships since there is nothing else to do except talk and type notes. "
good,"Great place and people management really good. just wasn't for me regretfully."
good,"Plenty of advancement opportunities within the workplace.  Has a positive atmosphere, and management really does care about its employees.  The nature of the business can sometimes cause layoffs etc, but Human Resources and Recruiting do their best to find new opportunities for all of the employees."

good,"all the co workers were very helpful,good company to work with,learnt much valuable things from my seniors."
good,I thought the job wasnt too bad.  I worked as a supervisor in customer service.  The hardest part was that there were no real repercussions for employees.  Employees felt that they could basically do anything without management writing them up.
good,"Great company to work for! Stability, mobility, and growth potential available if you want it. Training, coaching, and leadership support all lead to a solid work environment."
good,"Being a technical support specialist a a call center allowed me to fine tune my customer service skills.I was able to assist customers with a wide array of issues from billing, to problematic hardware. I did not have an opportunity to get to know my co-workers very well because of the individual work environment and staggered scheduling."

I must say that the kind of work I had was not that easy because that actually a very challenging work, but then again I was able to survived because really work hard and of course through the support of my team. I was lucky being part of this company."
good,I can say that working with Convergys is a very pleasant and informative learning experience for me. They provide us with the necessary tools and training that we can utilize in our day to day work experience. The work environment as well as our leaders and co-workers give us all the support we need in order for us to have a harmonious workplace.

I learned how to cope and handle angry, annoyed or frustrated customers. I learned the basic troubleshoot steps for different web browsers. I learned how to identify and provide solutions more quickly. Management is good. Co workers are fun and kind. Its never a bad day at work because of the people who work along side you. "

Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Working at Minacs was ok. It can be a great environment depending on how you look at it. If you like helping customers and don't mind the irate ones every once in a while and you can put up with the management then you'll do well. This job has a huge learning curve at the beginning for the first two months then this job is a breeze. Can get extremely boring as in most teams you are very scripted and say the same things over and over. The incentives are very nice if you meet them."
good,"A typical work day consisted of taking in-bound calls from hundreds of clients a day and filling theie medications to be shipped out in home delivery."
good,"I've spent more than 5 years of my life with the company and they have been the most fun and rewarding years of my life so far. I've met a bunch of crazy but awesome people who made life in and outside of the office fun and exciting. I've been given the opportunity to be recognized and mentored by such great people. I've learned a lot about life: how to set priorities, how to empathize, how to listen, how to be sensitive, how to be accountable, how to care for lives, etc."
good,"Working for Convergys as a whole was amazing. Great benefits, prizes on the production floor, bonuses monthly. But the line of business is stressful, scheduling is awful, and the stress of taking calls all day long and hearing people complain is awful."
good,"Concentrix is a great place, lots of opportunities - New growth and overall a great place to start up your career or build on it. "
good,"I found that working from home was great, it allowed time during breaks to do little things, I never had to worry about forgetting my lunch, how much gas was in my car, or where I was going to park once I got to work. A lot of people talk about working in there PJs however I didn't feel comfortable with that. I felt that being dressed to work gave a feel of being at work and helped to maintain that professionalism. "
good,A typical day at work will be answering consumers questions and concerns about their experience with the products. I have expanded my knowledge about hair care products and view things in a different way verse my professional experience as a stylist. My co workers are very friendly and willing to help when ever needed. The hardest part about my job is because I am a cosmetologist I can not see the problem with the hair and want to help physically to solve the issue. I enjoy being able to use my knowledge and my education is not going to waste.
good,Convergys is a solid stable company and a great place to get your foot in to the call center industry especially if you have plans to get in to management. Like any job or industry it has its challenges and those who typically speak of Convergys in a negative light are those who truly do not have a skill set suitable to take calls from customers which is the entry level function in a call center.
good,"A good work Environment. Managers or TL's are very helpful,"
good,"We work on software called Quickbooks, were we provide both technical and accounting support Quickbooks USA customer ."
good,"typical day at work was trying to find a place to sit and if you went on break hoping your seat was still there when you got back. Have to keep your lunch on you at all times because it may not be in the break room when you go on lunch. You would answer phone calls. The worst part of the job was answering the phone and having someone yell at you right off the rip before you even say your name. The positive to this job is that it paid well, you got bonuses at the end of each month, and you got health insurance even though it cost an arm and a leg. the thing that made me want to actually go to work everyday was the people that i worked with, all were very nice and very friendly. and at the end of training when we all got split up we managed to still chat with each other on our breaks."

good,"If you are just out of college, then Minacs is the best place to learn, and grow as there are lot of opportunity through IJP"
good,"It is by far the most laid back call center environment I have ever been in.  You can dress casual, management doesnt breathe down your neck about schedule adherence and the people are amazing and down to earth.  Unfortunately, how management runs things arent always the best.  After getting promoted to a team lead I was forced to share desks and move to different computers for three weeks straight!  The equipment they gave me didnt even work right as I was forced to have to replace my keyboard twice in the first week."
good,"A typical day at work would be to log into your systems and your phone and let the calls start rolling in. Usually back to back calling, handling the needs of AT&T's customer base. Breaks and lunch were very strictly timed along with expectations of the job. Management was team oriented and more individualized that way. Got along with co-workers well. The hardest part of the job was the work load, though after spending time there it became much less of a problem. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help people in need and hearing their satisfaction for it."
good,"I take emails, review the issue/emails, respond to customer's inquiry. My co-workers, especially my teammates was fun to be with. The hardest part is having grades to pass every week, trying to save my grades everyday.

good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes!

The hardest part of the job was encouraging the customer to trust me to fix their issue."
good,"Daily duties include Training and coaching advisers, payroll, training, and call flow adherence."

good,"I was assigned to a back office account under a Healthcare provider. At first it was difficult for me to adjust since my course doesn't suit with the work I am into but with patience and perseverance to learn,I was able to adjust. With the account that I belong now, I was able to learn medical terms and tools used. I also learned how to multi task especially if you are in long queue, you still need to work on other accounts for you to meet the end of shift target.

good,No one has job security at Convergys. A lot of gossip and favoritism.
good,"A typical work day at Convergys really depends on the project, but answering phone calls is common to all the projects.  While taking phone calls can be repetitive, each customer issue is different therefore providing some variety.  Prove that you are good on the phones and management may give you different assignments as they come available."
good,"There was quite a lot to take in the 10weeks of training, I learned quite a bit about the way, the current are delivered to our homes, and about the different prices the packages. My co-workers were a whole lot of fun, We had a lot of age cultural and race difference, The hardest part of the job was paying a young lady whom had a 2 yr old, and whom was trying to work a part time job to get us to work on time.(We Were on A Point System)"

Answer inbound calls from existing customers with regards to their satellite television services, assist with billing questions, equipment orders, small technical issues. Also suggestive sell on every call and offer qualified discounts or promotions. "
good,Mentally bracing yourself to here people or sometimes children lag on about the service or quality of the a phone that they have. At times the callers can cause a lot of stress.
good,"Have to review company email to see if there any changes promotions and of course get all your stuff up ready on computer. Once your day starts, you have calls after calls which you are only allowed couple of minutes before your stats get affected.But have to make sure you've done all that is required from each call. I learned to listen, think of a solution if not look for it, mainly keep track of my time, and to multi task. I enjoyed working with all the employees at convergys, they are all different wonderful people. I've learned that when I can't find a solution that i can rely on them to help me. Management is good they are on top of you to make sure your stats are doing good because if you fail your whole team fails and that reflects on the manager running that team. Hardest part for me was keeping up with all the changes if it was policy for them or third party change it was hard to keep track of all of them."
good,Training was timely and helpful. All questions that I had were answered and I was well prepared to work on the main floor. Supervisors meet with you occasionally in order to go over call management and quality. There are limited supervisors and on a busy day it can be a hassle to get one when you need them. Getting over time and hours were easy to do. The rules are the floor seem to contradict themselves at times.
good,"You start the shift at 12.00, you join your campaign of about 10/15 people. You form a circle and the manager start felicitating everybody who reached their targets, those who worked hard and encourage those who did not reach their targets putting it down to bad day. This briefing encourage everybody and enable those who did well to be felicitated by everybody. we applause each other. the ambiance is great. then you join you desk. You start doing your job. At 2.00PM it's the lunch break for half an hour. There is a canteen. Then the second break is at 3.45PM and  then 5.45. "
good,I received great benefits from Convergys for my entire working time frame.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Got good onsite opportunity."
good,A performance based job and individual as well as team based job.
good,"Enjoyed working in Convergys @Lake Mary, FL"
good,Convergys in early Q1FY15 bought over Stream global services and it's strong management team has handle merge quite well. The performance has maintain keeping clients happy and no Wagers or benefits lost keeping employees happy.. Although the work is fast pace and demanding our peers and co-works always have a positive attitude and keep a fun environment.  Hardest part of the job are the new aggressive revenue and gross margin goals.
good,"I enjoyed working at Convergys. The option to grow with the company was available, but we did not do a good job with employee retention. More recognition to employees would go a long way. We had a good group of managers."
good,Nice company to work with. A management team is really good. All are very supportive.
good,Great place to work. Would not work there if you tend to headaches/migranes alot. You will be wearing a headset for answering phones all day.
good,"Daily facilitation of new hire agents. Great co-workers and management but compensation is very low, and it is very difficult to obtain more compensation."
good,"I really enjoyed working at convergys, i got along with all co-workers and enjoyed helping when i could. this is a tuff job to do and alot of people didn't make it."
good,"Great experience, meet new people and assist with different projects."
good,"I really enjoyed working at this job. Customer service has always been my specialty, and I am skilled in working independently and with a team. However, the management made statements on certain issues and they were untrue, or not followed through on. I do not feel that there was room for improvement, or advancement. I feel as if my opinions and ideas were not taken seriously, although I feel it would have assisted the company monetarily."
good,"A typical day at Minacs involved catching up on the latest incentives General Motors had to offer.  I learned a great many things in my tenure with Minacs, mainly about the car industry, marketing and how best to retain customer business.  The hardest part of the job was being confined to a position, as there was rarely room for advancement.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the creative freedom allowed when corresponding to customers via e-mail."
good,Always a chance to make extra money. On job training. Room for advancements to move up the hardest part were suggestive sales
good,Management gives the support to employees in their day to day work activities. Good learning
good,"Typical call center 9-9 1/2 hours and you could be working 3 days before a day off or it could be 10, repetitive scripted calls, people at work are great, the benefits are alright."
good,"the people are great and work really hard to help you reach the companies goals,never any drama, as the work goes there are some good days and then some very very tough days"
good,"Empresa com bom relacionamento interpessoal entre os pares, tem bons benefícios, e vasta oportunidade de aprendizado."
good,You have to have a very flexible schedule to work at convergys. The pay and benefits are awesome but some of the management and employees are not!!
good,I loved working here. Would still be there is the center I worked in had not be shut down.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes!

good,"Used the time effectively and efficiently."
good,"Fun place to work, they try to make the best to make you feel good. "
good,"A typical work day would be me coming to work and doing my job."
good,Training provided was first class.  My job became considerable more focused on targets despite being customer service based.  Loved the people I worked with.  Not much room for development unless someone leaves or is promoted ahead which was a little bit of a disappointment.
good,"Clock when you get to work, only having 5 minutes to get all applications up and running left all a little short on time to start taking calls from the employees of AT&T. I would take orders to set up all the Uverse and Directv. Help the customer by answering any questions concerning the set up and execution of both products."
good,"We process customer complaints with their insurances, we logged it in the system and then our onshore partner which is the next handler will process it."
good,Set schedule which was nice. Lots of people working there but lots of turn over. Customer service department was strong.
good,"Customer called about their Cable not getting all their channels on their Master Bedroom and their Family room and was trying to find out why they was getting the channels. They Billing information was updated and they were on time with everything at the time. So i asked question about the cable boxes to begin my troubleshooting to get the issue resolved. First i had the customer tell me what channels there not receiving.And whats on the tv screen. and How long have they been experiencing this issue. i told the customer to unplug the tv for 30 sec to a powercycle on both tv's the plug them back in. waiting for the signal to reach and try them channels again. Then when that didnt i told them im going to send a Intialize hit to the box. Usually takes 5-7 mins to fully finish intializing. I learned the Billing the billing system, and tools for the job. Management wasnt all the great to me because i didnt understand some parts of the job. and i wasnt getting any help from as much as needed. The hardest part was getting cross train with one day of training but i made the best out of it. the Most enjoyable part of my job was being to be on the phone all day taking to various people around the United states."
good,"supervisors in my department were great, fun and always helpful. More importantly they were good with understanding people's problems, took the time out to listen. Hardest part of the job was not working pass 8 hours, the job made you feel like you can do more. I enjoyed being around a group of people who weren't snotty, rude or immature. Everyone was fun, great to be around them, loving and caring group."
good,I had fun working here. Good for a person who just started a family. Overtime was available when needed or wanted. Able to switch shifts with peers. Customers could be rude but that's expected with call center jobs.
good,Favorite part of the day was working closely with my peers to make things around the office more efficient
good,Cafe on site so you didn't have to leave the complex on breaks and lunch's.
good,"My day starts with a pre-shift team huddle where we share updates and best practices. Later I assign the schedule (target) for the team. I also perform some quality checks on the work done by the team. I also do multiple analysis of the data to prepare the report for the day. At the end of the day I send the reports to the client."
good,"good place to work, management is decent. do the right things and its an enjoyable place."
good,"I love call center management and this job really helped me find my leadership style and passion for motivating, training, and retaining employees."
good,"The typical day begins with an analysis of the account load to determine an effective strategy to contact everyone.  My client database contained people in the United States and also foreign countries in Europe, Asia, Australia, and South America.  After deciding who needed to be contacted, I would analyze the workbooks to advise the partners and end users of expiring service contracts.  It is my responsibility to ensure everyone is aware of the consequences of a contract lapsing.  "
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"* Busy day with number of issues will be challenging"
good,"overall good work experience and nice co workers,work as a team."
good,"A typical day at Convergy's would include logging in to the network and phone lines then answering customer service calls the entire work day. It could be tedious at times and strong people skills as well as patience were a must for this job though, as the customers calling customer service usually had a problem that needed fixing and could sometimes be quite rude on the phone. Other than that, the feeling you would get by fixing the problem was a good one. The Management was more individualized as there were teams of workers under one manager and they rotated the employees between the teams every so often. The hardest part of the job I found was dealing with the really angry customers, as there is just not pleasing some people. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I was able to please some of those really angry customers. My coworkers were good people but there usually was not much time to interact other than to help or get help from them."
good,I learn many from Convergys. All management people are helping us to grow our career. Good platform to introduce our skills and improve from our mistakes.
good,I enjoyed my time at Minacs Worldwide. This was an organization where the CFO promoted a youthful work environment and growth. I had the privilege to start my career at this organization and I must say that I learnt a great deal. The work life balance is great and the management is understanding to your needs as a strong contributor.

good,"Great place to work, lots of daily challenges to keep you on your toes.  Management team is very supportive and always willing to help."
good,"My current job at On Star is a good one.  Overall, I am satisfied where I currently am.  At On Start I have been able to build upon my customer service experience and have learned more about sales.  The most difficult part of my job is being stationed in one place without being able to get up and move around, but I have adapted quickly.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with customers, ensuring they are happy and satisfied."
good,Handling frequent incoming calls for national customers. Solving customers issues or concerns.
good,This job is a job that management takes to seriously is all I can say.

good,"I really love the atmosphere at Convergys. I love being able to make sure that people loved their new vehicles and making subscribers happy. However, I did not get as much help from management as I felt I could use."
good,"At first I was very skeptical about this work-at-home opportunity, but after researching more about the company I learned that it is a replicable business that has been operating for many years. I have learned to really enjoy myself at this job and it is very convenient. I also like all of the money that I am saving monthly on gas, lunch, and clothes."
good,"A typical day at work in Convergys consists of various interactions with Co-Workers and client representatives and is generally very hectic."
good,I was a customer escalations manager.  Learned how to deal with angry people on the phone.  Loved co-workers and higher managers.  Hardest part was keeping your cool while people yelled at you on the phone

good,"Helped customers with manual and automated directions, downloaded minutes and sold upgrades from standard to package w/directions and downloaded minutes to OnStar Hands free calling."
good,"One good thing about Convergys, specifically to the account where I belong to which was Citibank, is that information and up-trainings are properly and timely cascaded and conducted to its employees. The company provided competitive benefits to everyone. it has a friendly environment and the supervisors and top-rank management officers can easily be approached. I learned to enjoy the customer service job because I myself is a customer that's why I always strive to give every customer a delightful experience as much as I wanted to be treated. At first, it was difficult to adjust to the work culture especially that there are varied types of people surrounding you. However, I learned to deal with it since the company have a strong sense of importance into inculcating the values of having a balance between work, life and play. I am very proud that I was once part of this company."
good,"I enjoyed working with Convergys so far.,"
good,"I started out working for Cincinnati Bell and a portion of it was sold to Convergys so I transferred to that company.  We printed, processed, stuffed and mail telephone bill to customers.  I had at very nice and knowledgeable boss and my co workers where fun to work with, we enjoyed our job.  I retired from Convergy early doing a buy out program."
good,Rewarding call center experience assisting customer with client support.
good,"Productive, warm environment, professional colleagues. co-workers were like my second family; personal relationship was built. the company's benefits were superb. hardest part of the job was meeting the quota for collection and some metrics required; there had seating problems/concerns. every time our bosses gives perks, games, rewards as motivation for us to work better were the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,Talking with customers through a customer service number.
good,take callings from At&t customers with questions about their bills and new service.  we work in cubicals and all of my close co-workers are like a family.  we are team wildcats.  the hardest part of the job is hearing peoples personal problems about why they can't pay their bill.
good,"I have learned :- Team work , How to talk with people in good manners & how to convince them & made them satisfied."
good,Managed up to 6 Team Leads to ensure their Representatives were fully supported at all times.
good,Convergys was a great place to work over the summer where I gained valuable knowledge and skills. Also gave me several opportunities to move up in the company as well. A typical day was answering about 40-50 calls a day assisting customers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the speed of the system but this got better with experience. Not much interaction with coworkers due to our assigned seats.
good,"Ipical starts with high call volume, and every customer has question, some very easy to address others having to really listen to the customer as to address they're needs"
good,Lots of great opportunities within the company. Great work ethic as well.
good,I started here very young and took every advantage to learn how this type of client services company works.
good,The people are excellent and the work is rewarding. I have been able to take many training courses to help me to improve on my management skills.
good,Convergys was a very fun place to work answering the phones all day talking to such different types of personalities and problems.  Each day was a new adventure with so many diverse problems that you never know you're going to get into until you answer the next call.  I enjoyed working for a copy who not only has polices and rules for you to follow but also enforced them to all employees not just one or a certain shift or team member.  It made the environment very fair.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes!

good,"Minacs is a good place to work at if you like to talk on the phone and  input data. The hours can be long but there are perks. Some days we have events such as bingo days, freezie Friday. All in all it is a good place to work. I learned a bit more about excel spreadsheets. Some of the management was not always on the same page about training but overall they were good. The hardest part would have to be sitting for long hours. "
good,Learned many things about vehicles and what features work in the veh
good,"Fun loving people around, good to work over here. Able to learn about managing skills, to handle difficult work in time."
good,"The point system is poorly set up, and clearly biased. Some would get fired at the point amount they said they would fire at, and some employees could accrue 20-30 points and still be working there. Good money if you are a student who can work 40+ and not need to call out or leave for family emergencies"
good,Had to make sure I kept a consistant balance between call volume and reps to answer calls. Did scheduling ahead about 2 weeks but also had to staff in real time. Was responsible to meet the clients Service Levels and Convergys budget for staffing.
good,in this company i get to learn more and my communication skills is been good now then before
good,"Good to work there but I am looking no growth over there & I am board to take calls so I want to change my current job & I have good typing speed so I would like to join in Back Office job."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of approximately 4 hours of escalated calls and the remainder was helping regular customer service reps with any questions or concerns they had with interactions they were dealing with. I acquired great Customer Service as well as great De-escalation skills while I worked there these past 5 years. The management was always very friendly and helped with what they could when and if needed. My co-workers were also very friendly as well as comfortable to be around. I never hesitated to ask for help whenever I needed it. The hardest part of that job was helping the regular customer service reps understand policies and how they worked but in the end, it was all in how the resolution was explained. I would say the most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction of knowing I either helped a customer resolve a minor or major issue as well as an agent through a tough interaction or just with basic questions."
good,"I learned about how to handle situations for  customers calling from different countries with questions and concern. "
good,"I usually work on 9 to 18 shifts, managing technical/account support for italian customers of EA Games, though 3 diferent channels: phone, chat, emails."
good,"30+ year old company with 70,000 employees. Work-at-home environment is enjoyable. "
good,"Once i logged into my system I immediately start answering calls and helping customers with their issues. One thing i have learned working at Convergys is that you have to have patience with the customers regardless of how angry they maybe with their issues and I have also learned to stay humble as well. My Team Leader was not the best team leader st all. She was very disrepectful. I Reported her to her supervisor and as well to HR but she still did not change, but my co-workers were a blast to work with. If i had a question about anything, they were there to help. The most enjoyable part about my job was making my customers happy once i resolved their problems. "
good,This company gave me the opportunity to learn what I can do by my own....
good,Certain TLs and perks are great. It's hard to advance and the point system is crazy.
good,"I learned how to deal with Bell Aliant customers in various ways; such as troubleshooting, and inbound calls."

Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,I enjoyed being able to assist customers with their DirecTV account management and bill pay. The working environment was fast paced but not overwhelming. I learned many computer programs that were beneficial to quality performance.
good,"Very busy workplace. The company I was contracted out to answered for OnStar. There we handled a wide range of calls providing services such as lock out assistance, roadside assistance and emergency services."
good,I took inbound calls from DIRECTV customers. The best thing about the job was the people. The worst thing was irate customers.

good,i kind of enjoyed coming to work because you never knew what kind of subscribers were going to key the On star key in their vehicle.
good,"I worked with customers to assist with cable, hsi, or phone repair issues. I learned a lot about repairing different types of equipment. The managers were always there to help out if needed. Co-workers were great. The hardest part of my job was frustrated customers but i always got them to calm down. I just enjoy working with people."
good,"Handle inbound calls. I learned on how to deal with different customers and on how to troubleshoot a mobile phone. Management is also good, but there are times that we are forced to do overtime, but I do understand that because its a business need. I had a good relationship with my colleagues too. Hardest part is when doing overtime. Enjoyable part is when receiving incentives for a job well done and also the sleeping quarters does have big bean bags and the most exciting is free movies while working."

good,A typical day at work consisted of handling multiple cases for customers and dealing with service managers at dealerships.
good,Great continuing education. hours are great for families and the facilities were very user friendly.
good,"Overall working at this company was quite enjoyable. I was able to advance quickly into a management position. I was also given an opportunity to try different departments within the company. The biggest issues surrounding this place were varying directions given by different supervisors and working under a point system to which very few, if any exceptions, were made."
good,"For the majority of a typical day I would be working with the 20 to 25 direct reports on my team. Reviewing their prior day's attendance and timecards, attendance management discussions with them, montoring their call quality and coaching improvement. Data entry of weekly ""scorecard"" information for each team member, delivery of the scorecard and coaching for improvement."
good,As far as the position and the job I did a typical day at was busy and full of excitiment because you never knew what kind of customer you would be speaking to next. I love helping people understand how to do something that seems hard for them or frustrating so doing technical support worked out great for me.
good,Convergys is a ok company to work for. Some of the goals are not realistic unless you have to lie to the customer. They do expect you to be as good as a employee that has been there for 4 to 5 years.
good,Good company. Got chance to work on lot of Microsoft technologies.
good,"A typical day at convergys you help people with troubleshooting, you learn to deal with difficult and angry customers, and how to calm them down. The coworkers are amazing. i love meeting new people and getting to know them."

good,i love to work in such gr8 environment n mgt are always supporting and we all had a gr8 knowledge about the finance market and mutual fund.
good,Answer calls get sales. Show up -work hard. Some management could use people skills training but some were amazing. Co-workers were great resources - made great friends. Hardest part of the job- getting verbally abused by customers unable to disconnect. Most enjoyable getting to talking to so many different people & fixing their issue's.
good,A typical day at Convergy starts off with a lot of phone time and ends the same way. You have to long into our phone and about 10 different programs all before 9am or before you get your first call witch can be at 9am or a little after.

good,"Excellent place of work to learn more in different fields of business. Got to be close with alot of co-workers. It was scary in the beginning with having little computer skill. Trainers and co-workers make you feel comfortable-that you can accomplish this and not be nervous or scared doing it. One on one is avalialbe to you when it is needed and trainers are aware to look out and make sure the people being trained understand what they are doing before going on to something new. I personally found this to being an asset with this business. Also co-workers were there to give you a hand whenever needed. You get confidence in yourself and before you know it you are helping others, where you never thought you would be able to."

good,"fun, in terms of activities and employees party and team building"
good,"I really liked this company when I first started training I had a great trainer. Overall this company was honest, sincere but for me the training to fast pace and not enough help when you get stuck.  My first trainer for Turbo Tax was great the second one not as much. "

good,"It was a fun place to work at. The job was stressful, but my manager was extremely supportive and my colleagues were great mentors as well as wonderful friends. The hardest part of the job was of course the sales and the type of product that was being sold, but the experience was very rewarding and insightful."
good,"very good company to work with, earlier working with convergys which is merged with concentrix during 2018, that's why I started for looking change but I repealed on my decision."
good,"It was Good experience to work in Concentrix "
good,Its a good company to work. The job atmosphere and the mangement is good. The salary package offered for the freshers is very less for the location. Job security is good.
good,"management are very competitive, they let you deliver results which are sometimes very difficult. big compensation. nice working environment. fast-paced"

good,"stressful work but it is fun since I can satisfy my customer"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Concentrix is a nice job. They have shift variety. You dont work later than 8pm. The company is understanding to personal issues. Management is very helpful.
good,This place will work for you as long as you put the effort in. Great progression available and a company that you will enjoy working for. Basic salary as with a lot of contact centres could be higher but that is why your performance depends on your commission. If you perform well then you will earn a lot more and it might be more than you think.
good,This company is full of really friendly people. They have a nice break room also you get commission from sales. Very good area nice and clean relaxed environment
good,"I have worked in Concentrix for 8 months and i had a very great experience there. My trainer and Manager is very cooperative. The salary was good for the fresher as compared to the other company,"
good,This was a seasonal position with potential for being kept on. I had an issue with my insurance license so got started late with selling and was unable to meet goals.
good,"One of the best companies in Cebu. "
good,"Ambiente bom, descontraído e estimula o crescimento profissional"
good,"I was satisfied with my job with the company during my time. I was lucky to be in the morning shift for the entire 3 yrs that I worked there. It also helped that my teammates were very approachable and fun to be with but at the same time, competitive. I was a newbie in the BPO industry and didn't really know how things worked but they built my confidence. My supervisors also helped me improve my skills and discovered some potential abilities I didn't know I had."
good,"Right from the President of Concentrix till the last personnel, the 3 Values of the organization was well driven. The Leadership intervention, Rewards and Recognition at concentrix was best in class."
good,"Convergys was a nice job, working for apple great, the customers were nice as well. i would of loved to work for Convergys,but the pay was not what i was looking for. I spent just about a year and three months with Convergys"
good,"you job will be hard, it will be stressful, it will feel pointless, however, you get a sense of accomplishment in the fraud department that you would not get in the CX service part, CX service is nice and easy if not constant."
good,"Concentrix has a lot of good opportunities for people looking to work in that field it’s up to you on how hard you would like to work, but if you work hard and pay attention you can make it there"
good,"EPS is the the place where we should start our career."
good,"I learned to be detail-oriented and to think three steps ahead about what I would be asked. That will help me in this client-driven role because I’ll always have prepared, well-thought-out answers to questions they haven’t asked yet."
good,I happen to be in the ISM account which was really hard for me but I enjoyed learning a lot but I'm not comfortable being the night shift that is why I resigned after 2 months.
good,"Multicultural, co-operative management and proper work environment. There are multiple jobs in Concentrix also opportunities to get in other departments as well."
good,"Sr. CSE."
good,"I have worked in concentrix for more than a year. Work environment is good, will enjoy working over there. Great team members to work with. Nice office."
good,"You do gave job security at concentrix, most staff and management are very down to earth and helpful. They offer tuition reimbursement, referral bonus, and have gift raffles for referrals and job statistics. Always get 40hr weeks, job placements have sales and non-sale departments. If you quit, resign or even fired they do have a good rehireable policy. Training is long, Job repetitive."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Relatively good place to work depending on client."
good,"Pay could be much better, especially for mid-management. The culture is great though. They promote from within as often as possible. Reviews are honest, but graded harshly."
good,Really enjoyed my experiences at Concentrix.  2nd call center and well organized workplace set-up. Constant training; clean and well laid-out floor plan.
good,"I can say that the company has good benefits and they are concern on their employees especially when it comes to health."
good,"You will get all the support for your personal advancement and growth. There are training to support you. The shift itself is really long though, for 9.5 hours per day. Growth is a bit slow."
good,Es una buena empresa para crecer y tener una buena experiencia
good,Awesome company to work at. Work culture is beautiful.  Management is good and friendly . Low pay scale yet work culture keeps you going................
good,"I feel like concentrix provides a wonderful opportunity to many people. They have a sustainable pay. Also, they have wonderful benefits including vision and dental insurance. It also provides a 401k plan and paid time off. If you have a background in customer service this job would be wonderful for you."
good,"I do not have much to tell about the review. I worked only for 6 months there and I worked in a company of concentrix situated in USA. The salary given was too less, compared to the work pressure we were put into."
good,"Good in managing employees. Competitive salary and bonuses........"
good,I liked working there just got laid off. I liked working at my own pace. Would work there again if I had the opportunity. Only thing they need to work on is the pay.
good,The environment was pretty good. Since it is a call center focused on customer service it can become a bit stressful at times. Not too bad though. The pay is definitely worth it. Spanish speakers who are willing to take Spanish calls make an additional $1/hr
good,During my time here i learn a lot about systems that i would not normally run into on a daily basis.  The training i attended was decently paced and provided good in depth knowledge.
good,"I've been at a location for a little over 6 months now. The job is definitely fast paced, requires a lot of emotional and mental strength, and can easily bog people down. It's a call centre, it's not for everyone and your experience is going to depend on your attitude. "
good,Even  I started from a scratch and i dont even have a background in call center  they managed to train me well in a well manered environment. People at concentrix is very friendly too
good,Working at Concentrix was a great oportunity of learning of the different campaigns I was. The people around you is very helpful and they do worry  when you are struggling with something. The hardest part of my job was keeping calm whenever I had a mad customer yelling at me.
good,All though the environement is stressfull it is still a great place to work at and start a career. I honestly loved working there eventhough I faced many challenges
good,"The work environment and my other colleagues made me stay in this company for about 2 years and 6 months. Without having these fun people, I won't stay any longer"
good,"Loved working st Convergys, received good training, atmosphere was pleasant, fast paced, always busy."
good,I worked for Convergys that is sold for Concentrix. I worked for a very competitive project called Comcast. My experience was great and always ranked on top in customer experience.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,One of the best BPO I worked at.  Compensation is fair and benefits are good. They provide conducive work environment for agents and managers are mostly down to earth and approachable
good,Working for this company is great for beginners looking to get into the call center world. It offers greats benefits and has a good environment. Good place with good people
good,"Concentrix offers legit work from home jobs with full benefits.  The pay is not great, but the job is convenient.  If you are looking for for a job that allows you to work from the comfort of your own home, this is a great place."
good,"Since we are working on graveyard shifts, time is very flexible. Good Management and nice people to work with. There's also cool sleeping lounges and pro employee."
good,"It was encouraging to achieve new goals everyday. It's a good place to start your career in private field. The only issue is you have to manage your time for your other basic works, because you will not get enough time for that. But overall a good place to learn."
good,"A typical day at work in logging onto the computers and getting into taking calls and assisting clients in solving their technical problems. I learned a great deal about computers and how to deal with customers and how to better talk with people during this job. Management was really great on the lower side but the higher ups had to manage multiple contracts so sometimes they busy for long periods of time when you were trying to get information from them for something. One of the hardest parts of the job is having queues where we had to take calls nonstop for long periods of time but still try and find time to follow up with other customers we worked with before. I really enjoyed the learning experience and helping my coworkers find better ways to handle things and take less stress off by organizing their time better, as well as training new employees."
good,I am working here from September 2018. When I urgently need a job then I join this company. There are many employees working together. There is very friendly environment.
good,The managers are great and they understand if you need off for any problems. Everyone is easy to get along with in the group that you work with. You may do the same thing for 6 hours (doing surveys over the phone) but it is an easy job.
good,Coworkers were nice and enthusiastic. The support of the account I was assigned to was impeccable. Would have loved to work longer if not for the shifting schedule most often than needed.
good,I enjoyed my time at concentrix while i was there for the most part. You spend an entire 5 weeks in training. It was boring but it was paid even if we were let out early. Management is good and take any issues you have seriously. Really care about the employees. Overall the work is boring and dealing with frustrated customers all day everyday can be tiring. However if youre a good worker with good stats they do give bonuses and gifts for your hard work. Not the worst place to work if you can deal with a lot of stress.
good,"It's not as bad as I originally thought. Has a bit of a reputation in the town for being a bad place to work, but I seen few negatives while working here. Team leaders are all nice and the training provided is great (I was trained by Fionn - who gives 100% effort to train everyone and bring them up to speed. Goes above and beyond to make you feel confident on the phone and always up for a chat) "
good,A healthy relationship with your co-workers can be your motivation even if the job is stressing you out. The higher-ups can be easily approached. The most challenging part is when you need to push yourself to get the target score for the month and the most enjoyable part of the job is of course you get to know people with different lifestyle and share their experiences.
good,"Es una empresa muy buena, con posibilidades de crecer y horarios flexibles"
good,For freshers it is a good organisation to start with. On job training is provided to enhance skills of the executive.work culture is good .salary is always on time
good,"It has been very good role for the last 10 years.  So great to always be learning new tech and information with the contest changes."
good,I received good salary but the schedule is very inconvenient and they focus mainly on surveys that the customer answer and yet we cannot dispute it whenever the customer gives a negative survey for us.
good,"Concentrix   is a good  place to be with  as a working   environment."
good,"A typical day consists of logging into your computer, signing into your systems, then answering phone calls and assisting costumers with any situation that is presented to us."
good,"It’s a good place to work, great people, the company provided insurance, paid time off, but the salary wasn’t enough. Human Resources team wasn’t very helpful."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Has a lot of involvement with employees but still see a lack of skills and not that of a environment that everyone wants to grow with. People need to understand their ethics and work rules and then act accordingly to the business requirement. Need to work more on Cost optimisation and Revenue maximisation.
good,Excelente ambiente de trabajo y cultura laboral aunque no remunerado correctamente para la carga laboral que llevan los empleados generalmente.
good,"If you have a good work ethic you can progress. Started as a Fraud Advisor, helped new staff during training, moved into quality and coaching, delivered workshops, gained leadership skills, moved into a recruitment role. Built relationships with all staff and management and received superb support when required. Made some life long friends that I miss dearly. Concentrix provided opportunity to be challenged and to grow."
good,I'm still here and i love what i do. That's saying something all by itself. Great starter job with many opportunities for those who really hope to succeed.
good,"Overall friendly place to work. Lots of support in chat rooms,  once you get used to it. Manager was super! Wish they had more training before putting us on calls."
good,Job was easy. Co-workers were fun to work with. Inbound calls were not nearly as stressful as outbound calls. perfect job for someone that is still in school and wants some extra money for the weekend.
good,"it was fun working with the people inside the company, but the company itself for me lacked in some aspects where they could be tagged as inefficient or just getting their company name pleasant to hear"
good,Good work environment relaxed can dress casual  i learned a lot about customer service and how to use different computer programs the hardest part about this job is the calls some people are rude.
good,Loved it for years but there were issues with management at the end and being super sick during a really slow period were nothing was going on and I wasn’t needed to teach any new classes but I got fired for a surgery that I had that went really bad and took me awhile to recover from.
good,"This is a great place to work, as the culture is very welcoming and accepting.There are many opportunities to advance within the company. No micro managing here."
good,"Over all good company , however they need to find a way to maximize their resources , in addition to building expansion since they are a growing company."
good,"not a bad place to work. it did have its own challenges but came with great rewards ."
good,"I was with Concentrix for almost 3 months, and although I eventually cracked due to sitting for 2-3hrs straight at a time without leaving your desk was too much for me, this is a great company to work for. Team Leads, trainers, and other management want to see you succeed and will work with you if you are willing to show you want to be there. Great corporate culture and amazing/friendly co-workers. Pay is pretty good for a call center in NS, but it is hard mentally if it's not a job you are actually interested in. Extra pay for after hours and weekends isn't bad either."
good,"I had a good time working with this company as I had the opportunity to work in a morning shift, never ever had to work the graveyard shift which is a huge plus as I am well-rested."
good,"We are to answer customers inquiries, help customer understand their bills and answer to their concerns over the phone and try to upsell products as well. This job really did help me improve my communication skills and at the same time taught me how to care for my customers."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,They offered different programs and benefits for employees were good. They also had perks and incentives for employees. It was fun and interesting and there were rewards for doing a great job.
good,They gave enough training prior to on their system.  The only problem I had was I had no contact number to let them know how sick I was. They had an automatic calling. My supervisor did not give his number to me like he was supposed to for when we called in. I left messages at the regular convergys number and the training room. Yet no one called me.
good,It’s a very laid back job your sitting down all day at a computer with your headset answering customers questions and fixing customers technical diffulties with their devices...it was the cable department so it was pretty much trouble shooting and helping out with technical support...
good,I've learned a lot in my stay in Convergys. My manager was very supportive and very approachable. The processes are clearly rolled and implemented efficiently.
good,"It’s a great place to work, it has great benefits and great hours for anyone wanting to work. They also have paid time off but you can’t use it the same day."
good,If you can handle the pressure to perfom then this is a great place to work. Don't come looking for an easy check becaues it won;t be easy. The actual work is fine but they do not train you enough for what quality of work they expect from you. If you have previous experience then you will do great.
good,If you can manage working at home it’s an amazing job with mediocre pay. For the most part if you follow the scripts you will be fine. Leadership is active for work at home which is nice.
good,Convergys management needs strength and improvement with communication and consistency. The opportunity to advance is there however it’s about who you know and not what you know and what are your capabilities.
good,"It was a fun place to work, it was a serious work environment but during breaks we had a pool table and games to play, TV's to watch all around, Cafeteria had good food made fresh every day."
good,"This job allows you to discover the things that you thought you never had in you. You'll discover that you can step out of your comfort zone and be exposed to different cultures and nationalities every single day. Everyone in the office encourage you to perform to the best of your potential. The only thing that's quite difficult is your graveyard shift and it is quite expensive when you commute daily. Regardless, when you are in the office and the customer acknowledged your efforts and was satisfied, you'll be commended by your bosses and even give you a token of appreciation."
good,The hours pretty decent. Work fast paced so you stay busy and that helps time go by faster. Employees friendly management laid  back as long as you’re doing your job.
good,"The environment was good. Coworkers, OMs, TLs, and SOMs are all approacheable. They are willing to assist you if needed and they train you to be able to stand on your own. Over all, it was very nice."
good,"It's a third party customer service call center, and sometimes the jobs there are seasonal or part time. Can be very frustrating, but for an entry level call center or for kids just out of school its a great place to work"
good,Good place to work but is stressed at times have to calls in a timely manner or you can get a written warning and you get written warning if the customer didn't like the way you handled the situation.
good,We spoke to pharmacy technician to help the with the patients insurance information so the patient can obtain their medication. Its very stressful if you are not a phone person.
good,"A fast pace environment, suited for people with sales skills.Good salary for the right applicants. It is a fun company to work for. It is like working for one big happy family"
good,they value their employees and treat them with care and respect. The facilities are kept clean. the management cares and understands that life happens
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,The workday starts immediately and I learn something new almost daily.  The Team Leads and co-workers are friendly and helpful.  The company is stickers for breaks times and lunchtimes.  There fun times like pitch-ins and group decorating for holidays.  The hardest part is having to change shifts or bid for a shift every 3 months.
good,The company is totally good it's just that it's so far from we're I live..........................if can transfer this site near in taguig I'll do it thats why I stayed for more 3 years and counting
good,"aspiring and really great environment to learn skills in which you would  greatly benefit , you in the financial future ( becoming self employed) or having a deep understanding of the work load involved in accountacy and its many different ways in which to account for your money investing into your lifetime equity.  "
good,"I really enjoyed working at Concentrix. Management consists of people who worked their way up from the bottom, and are very kind and caring individuals. Management is very focused on ensuring that their team members have all the tools and resources needed to be successful on the job. Best management staff I've ever had the pleasure of working with. Concentrix provides their employees with extensive on site training on their policies and procedures. You're set up for success when you walk in the door, and if you do have an area of improvement they make sure you get the extra training and coaching needed to get over any obstacle.  They also allow you to maintain a sense of individuality and appreciate the uniqueness of every individual. If I had to discuss a downside to working there it would have to be their scheduling. There is no budging when it comes to adjusting your schedule to help suit your  home and personal life. Schedules are performance and tenured based and if your are a new employee you are stuck working the worst shifts. I've known several very talented and bright people who had to leave the company because they couldn't work around the schedule to help accommodate school or other priorities. However, if you're able to work whatever schedule they give you, then this is a great place to work and you'll get much satisfaction with the job roles given to you. Bright side they often bring in catering for everyone as a reward for everyone's hard work!"
good,"My overall experience with Convergys was outstanding. We were provided opportunities to advance to higher positions in the workplace. I became an Senior Advisor within six months of employment. The benefits that were provided are great, provided healthcare, 401k, etc."
good,I started on the floor as a call rep. Advanced to their SME(subject Matter Expert) team the advanced to the SME lead. in a matter of months. The data base for AT&T was huge but logical to navigate. I then advanced to Trainer and I had the best people of them all. The Floor managers all wanted my trainees. I taught them not from the books but from actual experience and had them in the Data Base from day 2 navigating it. This made them great call rep's. I then moved to Team manager. That was a very rewarding position I wish it had never ended.
good,"I've handled Financial account (Bank in UK) where were dealing with closing and merging of bank accounts. "
good,"fast pace, resolve issues I enjoyed talking to new people on the phone. I learned how to explore the internet a lot more. I don't like the high turnover rate."
good,"In Convergys, they don’t discriminate employees by it’s religion, race, culture, gender and even background for as long as you are capable of doing things that would help the company to be a better version."
good,"Good training environment. With the account/LOB where I was assigned, the people were not so approachable especially if you are a newbie. Some superiors were also biased. The company itself is great but not the management."
good,"This Job was good, you have a better salary, though it has a tight schedule especially when you have a graveyard shift. I learned everything in this job, how to deal other people, how to communicate in the other part of the country. And through this job, I learned to boost my self confidence which is very important to me.And my most enjoyable part of this job was the time i had my incentives."
good,"i enjoyed working for concentric, the management was supportive and co-operative.i stated as a call advisory only for IOS, Later i was trained for support for OS for mac. I liked taking OS calls as it was more challenging."
good,It is a good BPO company. you'll have a great superiors and the hr staffs are kind and approachable. It is not hard to be friends to anyone in the office even the security guards.
good,"Workplace was really amazing."
good,This is actually one of the best jobs I ever had I met people from all different areas also people from different countries. The staff and management was very professional
good,"As an IT support, we start the day with a Huddle then logging in to the system to start receiving support calls via phone and chat. Resolving issues with software installation and business application. With frequent consultation with SME."
good,"The company has a very dynamic structure and outlook."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,This was a great company to work for. I ctually miss that job! The pay was great. The entire facility was nice. People didnt come to work complaining about being there. People came to work and was happyto be a part of a team.
good,"Working at Convergys as an agent can be demanding and sometimes monotonous. There are advancement options and those options are worth working towards. Once you move up in the company, you will find that the days are less boring and added responsibility helped me want to come to work every day. Unfortunately myself and many others were laid off at a time when licensing changes had to be made. It was unfortunate but I was able to get a severance package and find other work fairly quickly."
good,"I enjoyed working with the crew.  The training sessions and Coaches do their best to keep a dry subject entertaining yet informative.  The new faces and changing job description kept me on my toes.  It can be a a bit tense at times so,  if you want to sleep through your days.... stay home!"
good,"It's a good company to work for in terms of call center work.  Rarely do sales usually the contracts are tech support or inbound customer service.  They operate in a legal and healthy workplace environment.  I'm not saying it's perfect but they do strive to plan activities each month and occasionally have pizza days, timmies days.  You never get yelled at by staff, always conducted professionally.  Hardest part of the job is just back to back calls sometimes for weeks before you get a break."
good,"This company has strict policies on privacy, therefore, all personal electronics MUST be kept off the floor at all times. For those who came during hurricanes, we were awarded pizza parties."
good,"Upon Working for this company I felt they where a decent company. Had multiple Trainers when trained. Very fast pase, adaptation to ever changing call script high volume inbound call environment.. sales and navigation. Management was good. Compensation could be better. I worked both BBWC blue button welcome call and Navigational Specialist."
good,Hard to work at any call center and this place is no exception it will suck your soul away but the people are nice and will treat you with respect but you will probably gain some weight and lose some hair while you're working here
good,It was an okay place of employment. The management could've been better. When I first started they never stated that we had a certain amount of time to get things in order before the program ended. Or that the program was even temporary.
good,"If your looking to switch jobs, but need the call center experience, then this is the place to go to get it. They will train you for what ever account you get assigned to."
good,"Must have very good multi-tasking skills, Must be able to handle lots of questions and use several systems at once. Need to be able to sit long periods of time."
good,"Nice job, I look forward to helping the customers, good location, nice benefits and great environment. The pay was ok, but it could have been better. ."
good,"Good leaders, good team mates, good work ambiance, might be stressful, but we got friends that we can call families. Salary is good , but sometimes add'l got delays"
good,"Convergys definitely looked out for its' employees. Even with certain issues that arose, my Manager and team were more than willing to help and overcome these with me. Every manager I had met held an air of confidence, yet were human and could make jokes and small-talk easily. I do not regret leaving the job due to personal issues, though if I were to go back to any place of work, Convergys would be it. Benefits are astounding, though the constant calls does leave one a little numb to social interaction."
good,I have had good times working with the leadership team of Convergys. It gives me so much time with family and fair to its employee. It provide fair opportunity to everyone and is a good paying employee
good,"This company has taught me a lot of things and was able to mould my skills to better, mature and has given me the confidence to look for the growth of my career."
good,"They off good education, and good training for Technical Support. They are willing to work with people with diverse backgrounds. Will work with you on you schedule."
good,"Concentrix is a very friendly workplace where every one will love to work and stick on. The management and the company policies is the highest inspiration for us to work on. A typical day will be made easy by the brilliant team work that we do. It is a place where we can improve our soft skills, computer knowledge, management skills and many more. The most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers and the break time that we spent together discussing much of the challenges that each one faced on their workstations and with different new topics keeping in mind about all the confidentiality that we need to maintain as per company ethics."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Convergys is one of the largest company I've been with my ability to deal with customers solving their issues really hone me and trained me well. Dealing people with different culture is really a challenge and that's what convergys gave to me to be confident on resolving customer's issue and giving them satisfactory customer service.
good,"The workplace culture was very nice; I felt like we were a big family supporting each other's back everyday, our team leads were always willing to lend a hand if we encountered some difficulties with our task, and the team building helps us to felt more energized to face a new challenge ahead."
good,"Great company to start off your customer service career with, they offer tons of training and advancement ops. Will provide you with info on getting discounts and incentives through their reward program. Great first job for me learned a lot."
good,The company has great incentive schemes. Salary given on time. Great leadership trainings provided. Its just that mandatory Rest day over time is implemented.
good,dealt with customers through the phone to help insure their cable internet and telephone service were working properly. good team leaders helped a lot
good,"A typical day at work consists of coaching sessions with agents, approving timekeeping and addressing any scheduling needs.  At Convergys I learned how to give and receive feedback in one on one as well as classroom settings. Communication skills are key in this type of work place. I have learned how to time manage, think outside the box and how to lead as well as follow when the opportunity presents itself."

good,The job itself was very laid back as long as you Came with a positive attitude and ready to work it was easy.Come Put In your hours and go home at the end of the day.
good,Convergys manages calls for a cellphone company. Most are inbound calls. When you are hired you will receive training and also take a training course. They are very thorough in their training.
good,"I worked  in the convergys 5 days a week, I have 2 days off. Its good because I have a lot of time to do my responsibilities at home. I learned to be patient when givibng services to the customer. I learned to used calm voice when talking to them. I become more friendly regarding to my co workers.  I have good relationship to the management. The hardest part of my job when you encounter high rate customer because they used foul words and they are shouting. The most enjoyable part of the job are when we have outing We go swimming in different province in the philippines."
good,"Even I'm still a newbie, the company already taught me a lot of things when it comes on how to do my job properly. Team leaders and managers are very supportive whenever we need help if we are confused on what to do with our customers. We are provided the necessary support like tools, documents and proper training for us to execute what we learn to our customers."
good,Coming in with a positive attitude is key to staying positive throughout the day. Learned a lot about sales and service as well and learning how to address customers with proper tone. Hardest part of the job was pitching sales.
good,"I work in the health care customer service dept. The job can be challenging but is a good job overall. The company offers PTO and you can build time off. The 6 weeks of training was paid, there are not many companies around offering training these days. They offer full benefits. There are some really nice people there that are always willing to help."
good,"Cada quien buscaba hacer su trabajo de la mejor manera posible, sin embargo los supervisores tenian conocimiento limitado y en unos momentos los agentes tenian que buscar soluciones debido a que los supervisores o sabian que hacer."
good,Learn how to deal in corporate world. Very energetic and helping environment. Proper guidance given by managers as well as motivation.Best learning platform for freshers
good,If you like talking to customers and learning about how credit card works its very intresting i dont like to stand on my feet very long so have an oppunity to sit or stand was good for me
good,This job is the same as the iOS job. Everything I stated in the last review stands as the same for Convergys. iOS was just a project on the Convergys platform.
good,A condusive atmosphere to advance. It was a professional and customer satisfaction driven environment. Although our clients would occasionally leave our location too quickly it was a chance to show excellent customer support in new fields.
good,The management is good and the salary balanced with how difficult the account. Work and life balance. The people are very friendly. This review is only based with the experience that I have with my assigned account
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,I enjoyed working at Concentrix very much. This was my first experience working in a call center and I learned both good and bad things. This specific location was sort of a mess when it came to management. Half the time it seemed like the managers weren't entirely sure of what was happening on the floor and most were not present. IF you are good at being able to independently balance your workload and keep yourself focused this is a great place. For those looking to have your hand held throughout the work day this might not be the best choice.
good,"This company had some great features the salary the security and the workplace. But there is one thing that is not clear to me is about the incentives that they need to give. I mean we work hard for it. So that we will get what we need to earn. But their reason is ""that's the only incentive budget that we have"". At the first place they should not announced it to everybody that this is the amount that they are giving if we can get the job done."
good,"Overall I give 5 star to Concentrix daksh. The best part of Concentrix is. You can easily find best people. Most of the senior Employees are supportive. Specially when you need it more. For example, while handling customers queries.  Best place to work.  IJP selection process is worst."
good,"with the company I would say its fun to work there but in the account  our manager was not fair enough."
good,"I learned how to be customer-centric and suggestive, two lessons everyone should learn in today's workforce. Management was helpful, but HR is bad about dropping the ball and not following through on commitments."
good,It was a good company to start with a lot of focus on employees welfare. However the management was weak with less projects and less career growth opportunities.
good,"The first thing you learn walking through the door at Convergys is that the pace is very fast, The company makes it their primary mission to satisfy the customers of their clients. This drives a focus on not just being knowledgeable and pleasant but but expedient while not allowing the customer feel as if they are rushed. It can be a tricky balance at first, but the experience is well worth it."
good,"Working a convergys was exciting. I applied for the job right after high school and it was a great starting point. The pay was very decent at the time and hours are very flexible. A typical day at work would be very fast paced. Call after call. From locating places for customers to answering billing questions there was always something to be done. Management is not as hands on as most places are, you never really interact with them at all. Its a very diverse atmosphere."
good,"This is a low-end call-center with various technical support contracts."
good,"wonderful coworkers and an outstanding supervisor, will do everything in their power to accommodate you and your needs! will provide you with adequate break times, and will work with you through any problems that arise that conflict with your schedule."
good,Convergys Corp has a wide variety of culture. I was a great way for me to start. The company allowed me great opportunities after relocating. I've learned a lot that I've been able to take with me as I advance in my career.
good,Agents are well compensated. Added skills provides complexity allowance in addition. Facilities are quite old. But the only negative thing I never enjoyed is transferring to different teams every month and sometimes every 2 weeks.
good,Concentrix  proved to be one of my most challenging  position the job thought me and advanced my already known skill to better and advancement my Tech studies and career objectives fulfilled. It was a bomb working there.
good,I did enjoy my time at Convergys overall despite the few hiccups I encountered. It was a new site so there were bound to be some issues and all things considered they handeled them pretty well
good,"worked on cust plans promotions and sales offers, assited with billing. warranty claims and trouble shoot there services and invoices. walked cx through programming there phone and helping them assist with billing."
good,"would work around schedules for school"
good,"I got to learn a lot from using computer, printer and Virtual reality. I answered emails and phone calls and provide customer support. The management was pretty good and I felt it was easy to talk with my team leaders."
good,"Good company to work with as they provide flexibility for application support engineers to work remotely."
good,Working in Convergys helped me in my confidence and tolerance for irate customers. Pay is good and many incentives are given specially on holidays. Good working environment
good,"I had a very good training for 3 weeks."
good,Excellent place to work. The dress code is extremely casual and the environment is very laid back. There is a great career path to management with comprehensive training.
good,"I really like this job it has great health benefits and management has been very good to me . But they are getting rid of my department. And doing away with directv. So the time has come for me to find a new, better job"
good,"Company allows growth and they are pretty much open to any suggestions, ideas and has open door policy which allows all employees to voice out what they feel about the company. Work place is employee friendly that offers competitive salary and lot of benefits. In some instances, there would be a time that vacation  leaves are being denied because of the work load but overall they still manage to keep employees well compensated and treat everyone with respect."
good,Should restructure the benefits for advisors. Good management but not too confident about the IJP process. HR should think more about employee engagement programmes specially the middle management.
good,"It was quite hard and difficult yet,  fun, challenging and knowledgeable environment. I learned how to deal with wide variety of people with different attitudes and personality. In terms of Management, I can say that they are handling their subordinates properly. Having a different culture in a workplace can affect the relationships between workers in terms of beliefs, however, this serves as stepping stone for me in order to be mature enough in understanding the people around me, earning respect from them in response with yours, is a sign of good communication. Good communication justify success."
good,"My typical day at work begins by checking callback commitments assigned to me.  Taking supervisor/manager's call while assisting agents on the floor with their calls.  "
good,"Great place to work. They really work with you and help you learn the company. Wish I still worked there and advanced. Hopefully I""ll get another chance to work in a place like their great experience."
good,"My time at Convergys was great. The training and support I received was very good. The pay and competitive nature was enjoyable. My only gripe is that you are required to make a sale on every call. We were a call center for a major cell phone company and we were required to attempt a sale on every call, no matter the contents of the call."
good,"Enjoy the job very much due to a injury had to take sometime off and did not complete training. Even though I was told to return to a different training on January 3 when I did they had already completed the emergency training I needed and was starting to get tested on live calls, with this occurring I did not return to work because I felt like even though I had the right documentation I should not have been put into a training class and tested when I did not have the proper training completed."
good,I feel Convergys gives you a good platform to start you career. The environment and management helps us to achieve more.It help us to turn dream into reality.
good,"The way Convergys handles their agents are well taken  care of. You meet and connect with your teammates, your leaders, your clients, almost everything. There's even a healthy canteen waiting for you in every floors awaiting for your preferences. The devices they use are acceptibly so-so. "
good,"Good position for those who are fast learners and people friendly. Competitive pay. Paid training. Good work environment, although there is a high turnover rate."
good,"The Company has a good international reputation in their line of Business. They have a good career growth path and gives equal opportunity. However, they have a difficult Scheduling shift, Since all of their clients are from a different time zone."
good,"Fast paced, challenging environment.  Trainers were very thorough with getting you inculcated with AT&T protocols and procedures.  You were always given an opportunity to show what you learned."
good,The culture when I worked there was very corporate but all of my managers were understanding people who respected your time outside of work. As a young man with a budding family this was important to me.
good,"day work used to be hectic , sometimes happening sometimes frustrating."
good,"Convergys is the best place to work, we are here to help our client, in order to provide the service to our clients customer. It's wonderful time, and I learnt many thing here."
good,Convergys is a great starter to temp job to build yourself up. If you want to learn about dell and troubleshooting this is the place to start no doubt about it.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,This is a nice place to work and good work culture. It’s an employee friendly organisation. With making safe and secure working environment. Overall nice place to work
good,Concentrix's environment is also good for all the employees. Their salaries are also good. It was my contractual basis type job. But I enjoyed every moment during my job. Seniors are also well behave.
good,A typical day for me would be to come in and log onto the computer and start taking calls. 
good,Its very good platform to improve our skills but coming to salary it is average package and we will get tremondus support from supervisors and also there is incentives based on performence
good,"People Management,Training and Development Skills,Monitoring,Calibration,Meeting SLA, Metting Quality Target.Handling the Team,Reporting,KYC AML,Coaching & Mentoring"
good,Near where I live. Training was superb. Trainers were very good. People there were nice but sometimes ghey force their agents go take a mandatory OT. Great place though
good,"I enjoyed working at Convergys because I learned something new everyday, not only at work but my day to day life. I got to talk to amazing people all day and help them out even if it was for their tv services. I also got to be a Coach so I got to teach the new agents how to do the job properly and efficient and make some kind of a difference in their life. I love the fast paced and having a challenge, and I just thoroughly enojoy customer service."
good,I enjoyed a lot made all nice friends the management is helpful but lot of pressure in etisalat apart from that everythin us really gud..cafeteria s nt tat grt
good,The typical day at work is taking in calls. Resolving customers issues. The things I learned are being patient and be confident. Management wise is not really good. The hardest part of the job is being stressed because of the numbers of calls. Most enjoyable part is meeting new people.
good,"A typical day is leading a morning meeting, monitor agents who are struggling to get sales.  If an agent is struggling, I would live listen to them and provide feedback while on the call with hopes to get the sale.  I would also pull a struggling agent off the phone and provide one on one coaching to improve success rate for daily performance as well as overall performance."
good,Me gusta mucho la experiencia que he podido adquirir en este lugar.
good,"Nice place to work in."
good,"Every employees were helpful, supportive, regardless of the score. I have learned to support the juniors any time i we know any information regarding the issue.."
good,"With a good team leader, the team will always move forward. Can form a great bond within a team, thus resulting in a successful team in a call center industry."
good,I met different people from all walks of life while I was working here. Convergys gives prime importance to its clients and also to its employees. Employees are well-compensated.
good,The job was fine it had flexible hours and the crew and managers were extremely professional and kind. The teachings of the company was fantastic I was able to learn everything I needed to within the first 2 weeks.
good,"i had a lot of fun with the company, especially how they treat their employee, its like were really family. i remember when we went to Batangas ( province in the Philippines ) for team builder , we exchange words , secrets we played  games. it was fun .. that's one of the things that i remember when i heard the word DISH CONCENTRIX"
good,The last manager I had was awful but the place wasn't that bad to work at. I met some really great friends there and I gained experience in a new career field.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"I'll forever cherish the time I spent in this company. I'm glad this was my first BPO experience because as toxic the account I was in might be, CNX has squeezed out skills I never thought I had."
good,"At first productive and fun, then it changed dramatically a lot commission was limited, no more fun activities or barbecues event. Pension retirement contribution was eliminated"
good,Talking with customers you received really mad people and then some really happy people you just have to listen to the customer and help them calm down while you help fix their issues.
good,very good training and very detail oriented. angry customer because of sales pitch . beside it was very relaxing and easy job. employees were kept check with a lot of supervision

good,trobleshooter  of internet connection many calls from  customers with internet problem learn how the internet work. good culture. dealing with difficult callers.

good,"Company has a lot of processes with several departments which helps an employee to explore his/her skills in different departments through IJPs."
good,"stressful but good company getting the sales is challenging, they have a good schedule that you can work you meet a lot of people on the phone and in person"
good,This was my second job.. typical call center.. But the work was not stress filled.. enjoyed working.. taking more than 100 calls a day made me achieve the given targets and customer satisfaction.
good,"Normally I would come in and find an available computer to clock-in on and setup. Once I'm in and got all of my tools opened up, I would log into my phone so I can start receiving calls and handle my customers. It was a fast paced job where everyone is handling their customers in a short timely matter with the highest quality of customer services we were able to provide. The hardest part was probably adapting to different customers because not all will be friendly when calling you. But the best part of the job was when those so-called angry customers are thanking you for assisting them with their issue and apologizing for their behavior. That makes the jobs worth everything at the end of the day, to make people happy when they've had a hard day for whatever the reason may be."
good,"Convergys es en general una buena empresa para trabajar, las personas son amigables y el ambiente laboral es bastante relajado."
good,"good company fair to work for good follow up with staff and compensated well . purchased equipment and timely in reimbursement of mileage. They told us up front it was a contract position but people under contract were not paid vacation and people that were hired as permanent status were given paid time off, was not that way across the board and it should have been."

good,"I loved this organization because it was my first organization in Bangalore, India. Management were very supportive and caring. Their understanding were great. Positive culture."
good,"Its a perfact place to work as beginner in entry level jobs. Good management,"
good,It can be a great career move if you are the type of person who can separate work life from home life. At times it can be stressful but if you have a positive attitude or maybe just thick skin you'll find the benefits more than worth it.
good,Working here was a good experience. Good pay.  Nice people and good hours. Dealing with customers was stressful but rewarding. The culture was one of work hard play hard and most employees were easy to get along with. Management was realistic with it goal settimg and seemed to care.
good,"A good company to work with, exposure to International market,  Nice work environment, Management is good, Growth of career is slow that is the bad part"
good,"Certain projects are fun, the employee workforce is made up a diverse and mostly tolerable crowd. RCI was horrible to work on, their rules, policies, and expectations are completely unrealistic long term."
good,"I love convergys. I love the people I used to work with, the team leaders and the senior operations manager. There's a lot of engangement activities for employees and no gender discrimination."
good,"Pay is not bad, but management is no in tune with the objectives which cause to work overloads in employees. Besides that I'd recommend people to work there but not take it as a place where you can forge a career."
good,I was responsible for answering technical questions for customers and setting up service calls for people who needed repairs. I was fine with the job but a lot of the customers were terribly rude and unwilling to work with you.
good,The work culture is very satisfying. Handsome incentive structures with co-operative personel. The company has a very professional approach with a very good client base. The only dissatisfying part is the long work hours.
good,"Productive, less opportunities for growth, good transport service."
good,"A typical day consisted of a high call volume which I enjoyed"
good,They are big on employee engagement and career development. They focus on building talents from within instead of hiring outsiders. They also help communities.
good,"Great place to spread your wings! "
good,the company is a good place to work. they value their security ans they contribute to the community. they have programs such as donating in the community and that what i love the most here. because me as individual i also love to help the people around me.

good,"Productive, need to be there for a long time, crazy hours. Not for someone with children and alone with no help, would need a babysitter.............."

good,Working in Convergys is fun. I've met different kinds of people who later on became my second family and that's a big help for me to be productive and take my responsiblility as an agent. Things get easier when you  see them smile and welcome you as part of the team.
good,I grabbed more information about Human resources and the payroll system works in the company. I also learned how to use workday tool. The management was very supportive and had arranged lot of fun activities.
good,"Convergys relies heavily on it's team environment for success. This results in very few leaders, and many many followers. An agent has very little opportunity for advancement."
good,"This Industry is for extra income but if we need extra money u have to Do Smart work like achieve all parameters productivity,quality and good feedback from client and uplines .company is good no issue at all But I want to switch because looking for better career and opportunities. Thanks."
good,"a typical day simply involves incoming call being handled about the ONSTAR or navigation instructions"
good,"First of all the company is very good, I enjoyed my work with my colleges and all my TL's and manager were very supportive in every manner. I really thank the company for being very supportive, giving me such a platform to prove myself and for teaching me alot if new things as well....

good,Working at Convergys it is very fast paced and diverse you meet alot of different people. I learned from working at Convergys how to deescalate situations at all times and to be very friendly. Management works with you no matter what the situation is and is always a helping hand making sure that you are doing your best and to exceed what is expected from you. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with different customers throughout the day from different parts of the United States.
good,"Great training allowed me to be comfortable starting as a technical support agent, and they were also very flexible with my schedule. Overall this company was a great place to work at."

good,"Working with this Company is a good experience, the people are nice, benefits and salary are good. It was really a good company, the only thing that made me resign is the location, It was too far from home it will took me 2 hours to go to office. So I'm having a hard time travelling, lack of sleep and bigger expenses due to Transportation."
good,"The company cares about its people. It has a lot of ways to develop its employees. Some examples are training, mentoring programs, performance manage plans, etc"

good,Convergys has been a great place to work. I enjoyed the opportunity to help others and watch them grow over time. It is unfortunate that they have elected to close both the Provo and Ogden locations.
good,"This job is a stepping stone, There are plenty incentives in which it could be more but this job it helps you gain self discipline, it takes a lot to deal with the customer base but it'll help you learn patience too."
good,I enjoyed working here. The hours and schedules can be difficult to manage sometimes. The environment is laid back but still professional. I would recommend working here.
good,"Great place to work. Great management, great team members and great location. Plenty room for advancement. The workplace culture was great. The most enjoyable part of this job was talking to the drivers calling from their vehicles with all types of things."
good,"Everyday is a typical day at work place due to huge work load pressure"
good,My typical day at work is fun because i have a good workmate with pleasing personalities. I have learned a lot of things in working as a Customer Service Representative most especially in dealing with different types of customers with different personalities. The management is good and they do their job great. The hardest part when it comes to the field of work I have is dealing wit irate customers. The most enjoyable part I have experience is giving our customers the most accurate responses they need.
good,This company is awesome on many levels but the most important is helping you become fully employed with a new company for a career. Also they have great detailed benefits for employees. There are a lot of incentives involved with working hours and accomplishing goals.
good,The company is good.but there is noo hikes like some other companies.and there is no othe facilities to the employees.if we will work extra work hours there is ot.
good,"I learned to be flexible and to communicate with different kinds of people. I learned to go beyond what is expected of me. I learned the value of Visibility, Velocity and Vision."
good,"The account where I belong now is really established. We started catering phone and email. Now, we have chat support and the action plans of the program is progressive. Scorecard has been passing month over month due to commitment and collaboration of everyone."
good,"Sitting in a small cubicle space answering phone calls to book room reservations at Wyndham Hotels and Resorts. Management worked very well with others and even with personal situations. Laid back workplace with opportunity to grow and advance. Hardest part is sometimes call flow is slow so time moves slower. Enjoyable is the work environment is comfortable and people were easy to get along with, plus no dress code."
good,"Since it was my first time to work in a BPO company, I could say that it's fun and has a healthy environment. It has a good management. Their facilities was good also. Friendly people and staff."
good,"Head office is surely a great place to work at as compared to factories."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Waking up in the evening is one thing I have already embraced as a part of my career because of the difference in timezone with our clients. During my employment, I have learned that change really is inevitable. One day, you are doing just fine in helping clients with their online orders, next you are being trained as a financial advisor. The best thing that made this change better was that it helped me realize how great I can become not just an associate but be a part of management too. Leaders are pushing through your own career growth. Hardest part of the job is when you simply cannot provide what the client needa because of company policy. Its always very frustrating when you want to help but couldn't actually do anything."
good,It is a good place to start your career and to know more about the corporate world. The management of the company is very good and helpful and you can sortout the problems easily. The workculture motivates you to learn more and more about the outer world. But you should be able to work for longer hours.
good,"I have been with Minacs for almost 15 years. We have recently been bought by Concentrix and are beginning changing the corporate culture to bring us in line with Concentrix's values. "
good,"In the 11 years that I have been with the company, I have had the opportunity to work in a few departments, I am currently a trainer, a  position that I take great pride in. I have worked under several great leaders and learned from each of them. "
good,"This is the organisation where I learnt a lot. "
good,"Managers are very supportive, employee centric, good environment, people here are amazing.... Can have fun while working, extra curricular activities..."
good,"Convergys was my second home for more than 5 years. I realized that it depends on how the management handle their employees. I'vte experienced being down and lazy but when management was changed, everything changed as well. "
good,One's patience is being tested to its  highest level. Each and every employees is learning new things everyday such as dealing with different kind of people from different walk of life.
good,"More working skills you can gain over here and yes we do have fun at work and all celebrations will be great ."
good,Convergys is a brand name and it provides a good growth opportunity to fresher's and all the members are supportive and her helpful. Work environment is pretty cool.
good,While working at Convergys I had to answer phone calls from AT&T customers pertaining to their account with ATT. I enjoyed working at convergys because I got to help customers with self service.
good,So it looks like GM decided to go the cheap route and hire Alorica to work their call center. Concentrix was way better about pay and policy updates. I wished they kept their contract with GM but i hope they find better companies than ones who dont value employees.
good,Convergys us a good company however the salary is not good because of low monthly salary. It needs to have at least high salaray so that the future employees can be more productive.
good,"I learnt the following:"
good,"Mitarbeiter werden für ihre Tätigkeit sehr gut geschult, sehr kollegiales Arbeitsklima, schwierig ist vor allem , immer und für jeden Kunden eine zufriedenstellende Lösung des Anliegens zu finden und auch bei eskalierenden Fällen freundlich zu bleiben. dies Dinge nach Arbeitsschluss nicht mit in den Feierabend zu nehmen und abschalten zu können."
good,"Great Company, good workplace. So much to learn. Great experince to work with. People there are very welcoming. They give goo benefits accordibg to your performance."
good,Everything is good about Company however they pay less that the most sad part of the organization. Its a good Organization to if you are just starting your career however in the long run need search for more options as Because your basic need increases but your salary doesn't.
good,"Convergys is a great place to learn a lot, meet interesting people, and enjoy your job. It has a unique work culture that embraces the saying, ""work hard, play hard""."
good,"Everyday is a challenging day. Since I'm a Tech support here , I really find it as a challenging job since you will definitely use your critical thinking and your patience. However , because of the management and the culture of this company , you will really forget the problems and struggles that you have or had. I really like how this company manage/handle their employees with love and care. The hardest part of the job is on how you handle different concerns/problems everyday , dealing with irate customers and adjusting to new tools especially when you're new to this kind of job. The most enjoyable part of the job is being with your awesome team with your awesome supervisor who will never leave no matter how hard things are."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"During my time there, I did not experience any uncomfortable situations with any of my team leads or other figures of authority. They were very understanding with medical accommodation requirements and were more than willing to help with anything I needed. The only reason I do not still work there now is because of health issues I had begun experiencing during my tenure as a technical support adviser."
good,"Apart from working in this company and great account, found friends, who can talk about anything. Great company to work with and lots of to learn. Trainings are fun to be attending and you get to have real-hands on train to the products"
good,"Great place to work with good work life balance. Respect for individual. Work not very satisfying, but good team spirit and healthy environment to work in. Can improve on employee engagement at mid and senior manager levels."
good,"A typical day a work is clocking in, clocking out and making sure that your job is done correctly. Please note that there will be a change in rules about everyday and you would have to comply immediately or be written up even if you didn't know. The job starts off rough and doesn't work well with school and personal life but they are getting it altogether. I've learned about DIRECTV. The management team does not have it altogether but they are pushing to get there. It is a very diversified environment. The hardest part of the job is getting them to work around personal things and school, and complying to the daily changes in their rules. The most enjoyable part of the job is the compensation and benefits."
good,"Able to promote personal and professional growth. I was able to gain marketable skills and relevant experiences in the corporate world i.e. in retails, sales, customer service and etc."
good,The company is great to work for but the Longview location has poor management. I enjoyed working for the company but had to leave due to the management being horrible
good,"Convergys has a Big set of projects which are BPO Centric."
good,very secure and comfortable place to work.i enjoyed the people there and the pay was good. training was the best part great instructors and very informational.
good,"I enjoyed working with the Company, the environment was good as well as the work perks. The only disadvantage was our pay was not always correct, as such you had to check your pay stub every time you got paid."
good,"As a call center, you would expect more humdrum work than what Concentrix makes its world from. There are many oppurtunities to grow and expand both yourself and within the company."
good,"My profile was a customer care executive so job was to resolve Airtel CUG Clients on calls only. You dont require any technical skills for that just proficiency in computers, their softwares for which they provide you a month training."
good,"This was a very easy job. Answering phones and talking to AT&T customers. On the down side, talking to angry customers was not the greatest things in the world and it was hard to keep my cool sometimes. Management was the absolute worst. None of them were friendly and they all looked down on everyone else."
good,We have a stressful job but they make it balance by having a fun workplace. The are making activities that can lessen our stess and where we can also win prices.
good,"The management was great and I enjoyed my leaders there! I wish lunch could have been about 15 minutes more than it was. But overall, it was a great atmosphere."
good,"When I'm with this company, I learned a lot of things. I was able to manage my time, I can do multi-task and deal with different customers and provide the best service or satisfaction in every clients or customer's needs."
good,Unlike other call centers they provide extensive training and attempt to create an environment were one can be successful. They strive to build a team environment were goals can be met through teamwork and cooperation with management.
good,I started as an agent was able to be given opportunity to move up. they will provide sufficient tasks that will hone your skill. They just need to bring back the retirement and leave benefits they removed.
good,The Concentrix company was very good. The management system was very good with job you enjoy your time. The company create good environment fir employees to work over there. They have so many games on the floor.  Overall it is very good company

good,"Convergys is great place to work, so much to learn and amazing work life balance, ever helpful managers and awesome work culture."
good,Good place that offers overtime. Lacks benefits because it is a seasonal job. Changing of supervisors all the time. HR department does not always say the truth when hiring.
good,"As a BPO professional into inbound voice process,a typical day at work is atending to customers over the phone and solving their queries.It is a new experience all together since I come from a different industry i.e Media.Every call has new challenges and new things to learn.The workplace is supportive starting from team Leaders to peers.The most enjoyable part of the job is handling pepole with different thinking and mindsets and solving their concerns accordingly.The hardest part of this job is no fixed timings and an unstable life."

good,"I enjoyed my overall stay at the company for almost two years. The people there are very professional and engaging, not to mention youthful. The benefits and compensation also was great"

good,It was cool to work for concentrix. Need more opportunities for advancement. The calls weren't terrible. Customers were pretty nice.
good,"There is room to move up but the chances do not open up often. The environment is fast paced and can be stressful at time, they help with schedules if you go to college, and the pay is better than minimum wage. You will build up your communication skills and get a taste of the corporate life."
good,"the account has a large scope of support that i think is not enough for the offered salary, though, i believe that the security of the employees are good since it is located in a very safe location."
good,"This is my first job and first call center company to work with. I have been to Alabang site first and handled two seasonal accounts, both has already ended the contract. It is a typical workplace with free coffee at the pantry, typical commissary. There are guards in each floor which makes me feel secured. Cellphones are not allowed. The management in the site is professional. After a few months I transferred in Makati site to grab the opportunity offered to me before ending my contract in the previous site. Management in this site is ineffective. The site lacks manpower especially in our account that we are required to render overtime everyday."
good,"Convergys really takes training very seriously. The moment I stepped inside the production for the first time I felt nothing but confidence, because our training officers really made sure we knew everything we have to know before we had the chance to speak to our very first customer. They prioritize knowledge over everything else, and they make sure that you know what you are doing so you can help the customer in whatever they need."
good,The company helps me grow and learn a lot of new things. They also provide a good training and acknowledgement every time i get a good sales.
good,The salary is good. I was satisfied with the support they provided during the training and i like also working with the people around me but then the reason why i leave the company because i don't like working in night shift.
good,The working environment was very positive team oriented with incentives to excel as an individual as well as a group. Team leads were there to answer questions and coach when needed so you always knew there was someone who could help you find the right solutions.
good,"A day in work at Convergys involves calling o2 clients and advising what offers are best for them. The offers are in the form off contract phone`s, SIMs and tablets. This job has taught me how to act to the various types of clients in different scenarios meaning I`ll already be prepared for them with the information I`ve learnt. Working in a call centre is hectic at times but I make sure I concentrate no matter what's going on around me. If something in the job is challenging then I`ll take that in my stride, the most enjoyable part of the job is when I exceed my targets set."
good,"A typical work day at concentrix consists of providing fast and efficient customer service to our subscribers that call us who are lost and distraught and need our help with getting them to where they need to be. As well as answering any general information about what our service is, what we provide and how it all works to protect them and there family. The most enjoyable part of this job is going home everyday knowing that I have made a difference in someones life by helping them when they had no idea where they were and thinking they could never get back home."
good,"The work was challenging especially to the newly encountered issues."
good,"I have learned a lot from previous organization and very thankful of them . the management was thier backbone for as a  employee supportive organization "
good,Convergys is a great place to work and full of benefits from the company just not any improvement for a career. Also love the environment to work in.
good,"A great starting job, although it is very difficult to move up the career ladder in this company they do have okay benefits and usually booking time off is simple. Have not worked there since they implemented the new policy/systems so strictly speaking from my past experience. although the management there was unorganized and there is slightly unrealistic contract goals, overall it was an alright place to work."
good,"Concentrix is the type of company that enables you to do the things you haven't imagined doing before. Although it is not in line with my course, it enabled me to improve my proficiency in writing and speaking the English language."
good,"This organization is dedicated to provided outstanding customer support to its clients. However, some projects suffer because team members are not provided access to all the tools necessary to perform their jobs; but that is the nature of outsourcing."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"I would have liked to see opportunity with more advancement beyond current offered positions, and Higher wage opportunities for all lines of business. My hardest part with the company was the lower head count of support professionals for production, this leads to fewer available positions for managers as well as trainers for that line of business. Call center should have more options to substitute for when other clients close business, this creates less room for other job opportunities, for long term employees. My best experience was to being apart of training all new hire agents to be successful support professionals. Training allowed to me to express myself freely, and make agent's experiences a meaningful experience."
good,It is a call center were the agents attended calls from customers with their issues from their phone services and mobile devices. The company was very good to work for.
good,"a lot of changes over the year from different structure which impacts job stability. now we have more organized structure for Q&T."
good,"For almost 4 years and 4 months in the company I had learned a lot of skills in my field as a Sr. Web Developer because I develop/create/maintain huge websites and systems from the client. My colleagues are all great and easy to mingle with. Actually they were all my friend back there in the Philippines. "
good,"Convergys is a great company to work for however the outbound calling culture is not for me. I enjoy the call centre environment, but not the outbound process basically."
good,"sales from lead online. ring customers and offer new products to their needs."
good,"You never knew what time you would have to be in the following day meaning that they could change your schedule time before you get off or sometime during the night. Example I use to work the 10am shift not to long after I had started I forgot the schedule portal before I left so the following morning I was 30minutes late."
good,It's your typical call center environment. The one thing that stood out to me was that every year the vacation policy would change because none seemed to work too well. It was always a mess trying to schedule vacations. We did get raises and there was opportunities to move up in the building. Nothing out of the ordinary.
good,"Overall, Convergys hires everyone without discriminating.  The advancement opportunities are endless and easily accessible.  They almost always hire for higher positions from within. The hardest part about the job is meeting the set goals every month and the fact that they're always changing."
good,Concentrix Daksh is indeed a very employee friendly place to work. The atmosphere us excellent and try have the best managers and supports to help.
good,"A typical day at work begins with greeting my agents and knowing where they are seated to be able to address issues later in the shift, if there are any. The next task is to open email, sort and respond to priority messages. More tasks follow, such as approving timecards, resetting passwords, submitting tickets, coaching, attend a meeting or uptraining session, give updates to agents, perform monitoring for quality. "
good,"Co workers are fun to be with."
good,Convergys Is a good place to work. Always has plenty to do. Very energetic and fun at times. Management is awesome. Willing to work around your schedule and appointments. Family oriented.

Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Convergys has always been a very great place to work. The managers are easy to get along with, very supportive, and hard workers. I have learned that hard work pays off. As a manager I have learned patience and fairness in the workplace. The hardest part of the job is not being fully prepared for the work at hand. The most enjoyable part is helping others. My days currently consist of training agents and handling the struggles of working with multiple different personalities and trying to meet the needs of 20 agents."
good,During my time as a Technical Support rep. I' assisting customer with their problems in connecting to the internet. Also check the billing information.
good,great place to work awesome people chairs were horrible. if you do not mindbtalking all day this is a great job but i would not advise the card delince department to much anger and yelling in one place all day.
good,Productive and fun environment place to work in. Hard work pays off and can progress up the ladder. At times work under pressure however this only makes you stronger
good,"The atmosphere is positive.  Great people working at Convergys."
good,"If you are good at your job, you will be well paid. They make every attempt to hire from within. Attendance is the most important thing they look at."
good,"The compnay is fun because they do have alot of events and they let us be part of it. And there's no barrier or gap between the managers and the employees. Everyone is kinda equal and the treatment is  like friends or ""barkada""."
good,"As it was my first experience for job it was great working with Minacs Ltd, the management was great, it was having a friendly environment which helps in working smoothly and pressureless"
good,"Working on a BPO Industry was had at first as the work on schedule starts at the night you have to change your body clock and shifts differ every month--depending on the management. Working on this kind of industry gave me a  different point of view especially the CONSISTENCY on earning the clients satisfaction and assurance to be able to solve their requests, when you are having a bad stats there is the management that will always has their coaching session to ensure that every agents performs well and as they hear out every concern, the hardest part of the job is doing the consistency as you have to maintain the 3-1 call satisfactory and it is the hardest yet it is the enjoyable as you strive to maintain your pace every day pushing at your best."
good,"Good work environment, great Company to start an entry level job. Any grievance of employees is always given priority. Would recommend this company to anyone seeking a job."
good,A good work place. Team management and bonding is the best part that helped me work. It helped me to put my best effort on customer service. Handling multiple with different concern at the same time.
good,"To provide financial management solutions for small and mid-sized businesses; financial institutions, including banks and credit unions; consumers and accounting professionals. Developing financial and tax preparation software and related services for small businesses, accountants and individuals. We’re looking for a proactive individual who is ready to take on a new challenge. This is an exciting opportunity to be part of developing new ways of working and will be of great interest to someone who enjoys working on their own initiative, coming up with new processes and thrives on working with multiple stakeholders."
good,Assist customers with the inquiries with the balance and other informations regarding their credit card account. Assist with linking the card on their online profile. Challenging part would be answering phone calls from irate callers but I still manage my emotions and calmly assist the customer. I felt fulfilled everytime I resolve my customers concerns.
good,"The management team was very encouraging and helpful. Work was steady. The company gave a lot of support for how to find answers, the policies, and procedures. "
good,Opportunities to advance. Great culture and rewards program in place. Leadership was accessible and awesome corporate training available to progress within the organization.
good,I have learned a lot of skills and life lesson in Convergys. They invest with people and I have observed and experienced that. My experience in that company is remarkable indeed.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Awesome 10 months...great people and team. Various fun activities, Learned how to work together in a team. mixed bag of experience during my stay at concentrix"
good,I enjoyed being a part of Concentrix. I joined as a fresher (as an associate) and was promoted to quality analyst. My managers were very supportive and helped me to grow.
good,"The shift starts at 11 Pm "
good,"The typical day at work is receiving chat from different countries since we support world-wide support. What I learned from work is that you need to make sure that you did give the best resolution and satisfactory of your customer desires. If what they want, cannot be given with the company and we need to find how to give them options to make happen and resolve their issue. We always making sure that we always prioritize our customer. The hardest part of my job is that we do not have a fixed schedules.They are more on typical business wise. The most enjoyable part of the job is that while chatting, you can still chit chat with your colleagues."
good,"*This was a call center for hardware and software for computers.  I made calls for 8 hours a day."
good,Great place to work. But only for people who would want BPO sector. Great exposure for under grads. Not the right field for grads and post grads. Nothing technical.
good,"Actually my previous work is very good it's just that I really want to experience working on a different company.I learned a lot from my previous work, I learned how deal with different kinds of emotions and attitudes of many people, how to negotiate with other people , I learned how to manage my time, and most of all i learned how to be more patient.I love the management of my previous work because they are all approachable and helpful and also with my co workers they did not ignore the people who needs help. Well actually there is no hardest part of my job it's only the challenging part of it which is the irritate customers.But after that it turns back to normal talking with my friend sharing lots of experiences and i can consider that one as the enjoyable part of my job."
good,"It was an amazing experience to work with the organisation and the management was really good. "
good,"The job is toxic, requires us to do multiple work with low compensation. Though incentive is great  the job is overwhelming and very stressful."
good,"As a 4-year and 9 months employee of Concentrix, I can say that I enjoyed a lot working with my colleagues. I learned a lot specially from my managers and other colleagues. They taught me all the things that I have to learn to develop my skills and capabilities and to excel in every situations and on how to handle different scenarios in ease. My co-workers was also great. We treat every one of us as part of the family. We helped each others and build every ones' potentials. The hardest part of the job I think is nothing because as the other's says other jobs is much harder than the job that we had in Concentrix. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I am able to help and contribute to the growth of my colleagues."
good,"Cool place to work, nice atmosphere, I only wished they had a normal work life schedule like 9-5 Monday through Fridays... but overall this was one of the best jobs I ever had.. Maybe they should add a treadmill and get rid of one of the pool/ping pong tables lol"
good,Cafeteria is affordable. Free redbox. Good hours & pay. Only thing I didn't like was mandatory overtime. Everything is was good. They definitely took care of their employees & cared about them. made sure you understood everything before you got on the phones & if you didn't the help was there.
good,"I chose the hardest part of the job because if a person chooses to become a nurse shifting to a nurse, everyone will start from the basic. There is nothing wrong in learning things. Like for me, Im interested in baking now thou I am an adult already. I still want to learn new things."
good,This line of work is very goal oriented and we work with irate customers on a daily basis. Work mates and team leads are very helpful and we also assist our team mates on known issues as well. The hardest part of the job is working with customers who feel they've been misled by another agent and are requesting some type of compensation which I am not allowed to offer. The most enjoyable part of this job would be resolving all of the customers issues and finding resolution on their questions and concerns.
good,"Ótimo Ambiente de Trabalho, aplicações de feedbacks constantes para aperfeiçoamento pessoal e do grupo."
good,"I love working there great job"
good,"Compagnie pas parfaite, mais qui saura vous fournir de bonne bases en relation client."
good,"Great people from all walks of life"

good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Clocked In at 11am and started taking calls till about 3pm. At 3pm I would get a hr. lunch then go straight back to taking calls till 9pm then clock out
good,"I would recommend this company to anyone who is looking to return to work.  They start you off right with in-class training then nesting with mentor support.  Then your working  independently along side your co-workers.  Ongoing support and coaching is available when required.  With all the mistakes I have made thus far they still work to keep me working."
good,"it was a nice place to work at but alot of times they were just very unorganized. Its a great place to get call center experience,also they allowed as much overtime as you wanted."
good,"I had good bonding with the  coworkers as i mingle with mos lof the people easily , because everyone are enthusiastic and fun loving and helpful and I would say that working in this company  i was satisfied with my salary because  apart from the basic salary i earned a lot with incentives and management  was overall goot as there were many Internal job opening ."
good,The company puts importance to all the employees from agent to higher management prospective.  The program that I am currently part of has the environment where the employess freely express their ideas /suggestions in terms of developing or improving business relationship with clients and customers.
good,A typical day at Minacs would be interacting with coworkers to make sure that the call ques stayed down and manageable. Assisting customers on the phone from all around the world was a challenge because of the language barrier. Earning company swag was always a fun part of the position.

good,convergys has been a  good ground for me to showcase my abilities and to learn more. The management did a great job especially in appreciating and crediting employees that deserves it. I try to be productive for 9 hours in the office.
good,"Everyday was a bit stressing because of the queue because we have to cater on 2 accounts."
good,a great place to work but the attitudes of upper authority can be adjusted to make their employees feel like they're wanted and needed. people should come to work with a smile not a frown.
good,"Typical boring day at work where I do the same things I do every other day. What I learned is must seek more responsibilities that I think I can handle it well. Management is good although sometimes there are delays, co workers some are good some are not and all are very competitive, hardest part of the job is when you under go trainings at the same time and let you do shifting schedules everyday or other day or every week then night shift for one year straight but the most enjoyable part of the job is you all help each other and unwind together after you have done the job very well."
good,"Work culture is good, employees are friendly."

good,Convergys will always give a person a chance. It is a great place to learn new skills and find out if you are suited to a Telesales Environment. Lots of changes when I was there so commission structures were in constant flux. Team mates were excellent to work with and my Manager was great to work with
good,"nice place to work  funny challenging cooperative,helping while i am in trouble,company providing good learning courses"
good,"I love working here but it dose not suit me well i love being on my feet and on the go sitting all day on the phone, i not suited for me"
good,"I enjoyed working at Convergys as I excelled at greeting customers solving their issues and offering products that met and exceeded our customers needs. I was lucky to have very supportive management staff that kept me motivated and offered incentives that kept a competitive edge to the workload. We were in the middle of transitioning to another company when I left for personal reasons, but if given an opportunity I would definitely work their again and encourage other to work their as well..."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes!

good,"The work was good, I enjoyed working technical support there. Environment wasn't soul sucking. all in all, I've worked worse places"
good,"The management is very friendly and understands you. The work environment is also good. It has always been fun to work at Convergys. Since it is a product based company, frequent client interactions happen which is very helpful for individual development."
good,"The people you get to work with are all capable and fun people. The management is engaging and helpful. The sense of community there is amazing and the longer you stay the more benefits you receive, including pay raises. However the stress of being a Universal Customer Support Agent can certainly take its toll. For those who have issue with constant interaction with angry/frustrated customers this is not the ideal place to work."
good,"I typically work anywhere from eight to 12 hours per day designing, coding, answering questions, and providing guidance on an as-needed basis. "

good,"The typical day at work is helping people troubleshoot their Linksys devices through chat and callbacks. It's tough because you have to chat to a minimum of 2 clients to a maximum of 4 clients, each with different problems, and type with no shortcuts, and complete sentence and correct punctuation. I learned a lot with troubleshooting. The management and co-workers are the best. The hardest part of the job is sitting for long hours and the night shift. The job is not enjoyable, it's routinary and tough. But the best thing are the benefits, from perfect attendance to 13th month pay, Christmas bonus and team building. And if you are good at work, you receive additional  cash benefits."
good,"Convergys is home to many contracts that offer a wide variety of skills to be learned. I worked for multiple contracts during my time there and a typical day consists of handling customer phone calls in a timely manner and having reviews with your manager. The break rooms have televisions, a ping pong table, karaoke machine, couches and vending machines throughout the building. There is also a café located in the building for the employees as well. Management consists mostly of former agents that worked on the contract and room for growth is available. The most difficult aspect is striving to meet the ever changing metrics but help is available when needed and asked for. Hundreds of employees work in this building so the type of coworkers varies. Some are there simply to earn a paycheck while others are there to make a difference and advance. The energy level in most of these contracts are very high which makes it enjoyable to work. Music is played, televisions are on, games are held, all makes for a fun work environment."
good,"a typical day at work was very smooth. New hiring didn't get attended to as much as they should have, management really only focused on their selves. support was rarely given."
good,"My day starts with few emails about production issues or some RFC's to implement."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes!

good,As convergys is my first company so I have a lot of memories both sweet and sour. According to me convergys is one of the best companies which provides fun while work.
good,"A typical day at work is just taking calls, usually queing. If there are less calls in an LOB, we shift to a different LOB; When it is idle time for us, that's the only time we can chat with those beside us. Sometimes that's the time that we help the newbees when help is needed. "
good,"Fun place, friendly people. Everyone was great, you meet new and different kinds of people. Pays well, but it wont be for you if you can't stand taking calls every minute of they hours you're working there or not able to handle rude customers or sitting almost all day. Other than that its not that bad of a place."
good,* Being able to communicate and help the customer with the problems with their service is exhausting but gives you joy once you have resolved their issue with the service.

good,I enjoyed working at Convergys. The co-workers I worked with were friendly.  All of the customers I helped on calls were very thankful for my assistance.

good,"Fast paced work environment. Learned how to navigate through multiple programs to troubleshoot and complete issues with services and accounts. Management is very helpful. Ability to communicate with other co-workers helps to complete complex technical Technical issues. Over the span of employment, it began to get crowded with incoming addition of an additional client."
good,"It's a good job but it's graveyard shift. We are pressured with Sales and the scorecard but well, it's normal to any call centers, I guess."
good,"The people have a tendency to be rowdy, but other than that it was a really nice job. Management cared and did everything they could to assist you with your job and maintaining it. Over time available. They also work well with your hours."
good,Liked this job. Wasn't there long but would return to work there if rehired. Very nice office staff. Training was A+. And really liked my fellow co-workers.
good,Convergys is a great place to work at. Enough work and personal life balance. Great management. Great culture. Nice place
good,Typical day of work: MY work in my past company is quite well. I enjoy it somehow but the salary itself is not worth it enough. What I learned is that in each scenarios of call you must remember to put yourself as the customer in order for you to give their demands and expectations well. management is good but not good enough. MY co-workers are doing great in their job but doesn't show a true value and qualities of professional workers. about the hardest part of my job is not the job itself but how to manage to saty in touch with your co-workers itself. enjoyable part of my job is when I receive CSAT of course.

good,"Day to day was made good by the people there learned a lot working there lots of life skills, management was ok, co-workers were amazing, hardest part was the fact the work is constantly changing as the scripts what we had to say changed every few months or so, enjoyable part was the people."
good,"Relaxed work environment that has helpful team leaders and a team oriented setting. Lots of people with enough experience to help newer   team members and lots of new team members coming and going on a regular basis. Most of the work was helping people with billing and setting up new phones, with the occasional line switch or phone replacement."
good,"i had worked more than 3 years for this company & i felt management should be open for employees.This work place feels like a traditional work place, not good not bad,its a average ."

However, I was able to learn a lot about troubleshooting issues and handling customers complaints. As for the management, everyone was fun to work with and are really dedicated to help you in achieving your career golas."
good,Good place to work - but pay could be better. Great place to learn new skills that could lead to a new and more permanent position elsewhere. If you are straight out of college and seeking work experience this is a good place to start.
good,"The aim was to improve the customers score of the analysts by ensuring their learning is based on the analysis of their work and feedback given to them. A structured form was created to ensure uniformity in channeling of feedback given. "

good,Good place to work with opportunities for advancement if you perform well. Management is fair and qualified. Only con I experienced was issues with schedules always changing and had a hard time getting a shift with at least one weekend or one Saturday off per month.
good,"Great place to work, good vibes all around, managers are very friendly and truly care about their employees, and they make that very apparent."
good,"Awesome opportunity to advance and great culture. If you have the ability to solely commit to the company you will have a great future, however if you have a lot of other obligations then work can be difficult."
good,I learned a lot in this company. I enjoyed so much my training and wavemates. I have meet my scorecard and able to give a good service to the customers.

good,"This is actually my first time ever working in a call center. I have to say, I'm quite impressed because I really like dealing with technical work. This was the right fit for me as a part time job. The reason I'm doing this job part time is because I'm in school full time as well as the military. Convergy's was able to work with my schedule and the workplace is very professional."
good,"Working at this particular call center has taught me a lot about customer service, thanks to their 1 month paid training, which was a lot of fun and felt like a college course. The job itself is pretty easy, but can get very repetitive. If you don't mind having the same routine every day, then this job should be a cake walk. One time we had an outage in another call center so we had to take their calls, tripling the queue list, so it was call after call for 6 hours straight, so be prepared for the worst! The benefits are the best part of the job, as well as lots of free goodies given by management! The co workers were also very friendly and were always giving me tips on how to improve my calls. Overall, a fun place to work with people who end up being great friends."

good,"During our work time, cellphones and any other gadgets are not allowed inside the IT room to avoid unnecessary actions from the interns. We are also required to monitor every tickets being reported by the agents to immediately provide them their technical needs."
good,"This job has a pretty good work environment, however some of the supervisors aren't all that great. The pay and benefits are nice. Good Temp job."
good,"great people to work with. fun and lively."
good,Convergys is a great place to work and receive that great call center experience. Receiving inbound calls and outbound calls were something new for me. The one thing that I like about being on the phones; is talking to all different kinds of people and giving them all the information that I learned to help them learn and know more about the company.
good,"My day to day life with Convergys was rewarding and very challenging. Learning form one of the best BPO company gave me so much confidence and knowledge to master the art of customer service. The management made sure to equip us with every possible solutions to make our job easier and provided us the change to grow with the company. My co-workers were very helpful when we resolve our customer concerns. Helping each other made work environment a lot more fun. One of the most challenging part of the job is to contain as much as possible to customer's concern and have it resolved yet it goes beyond your scope, hence needed escalation. The best part of the job, is to get the satisfaction of making your customer happy and able to resolve or address their concern."

good,"Spent all day at a desk staring at a computer screen, and wearing a head set to answer customers calls and fulfill their needs. There were many opportunities to earn rewards at work, meet goals and be rewarded for it.It was tough work dealing with frustrated customers, but that tough me a lot on how to deal with it in a positive way. The hardest part of the job for me was staring at the computer screen all day and sitting down I would prefer to get up and walk around more often."
good,"mon avis sur cette entreprise c'est qu'elle est très successive elle est partout dans le monde "
good,"I enjoyed my typical day at work. I learned to better communicate things with my words, as well as how to handle more stressful situations. This environment was major with allowing the employees to work both independently and with a team to maximize results. I now know how to be more flexible with different personalities on a daily basis, and how to adapt to whatever situation presented."
good,"Good enviorment nice work style it was nice working .All day is busy day,good place to learn,management motivates gives new challenges to face"

I'm learning how to troubleshoot complex issues which is a very valuable skill to have."
good,I worked at convergys for about 6-8 months. I enjoyed my time there and the pay was pretty decent as a entry level customer service job.
good,"The team efforts are what makes any of the stressful parts easy to get through. I appreciate the management involvement, and the efforts from the beginning to make sure many weeks of training are allowed before being thrown into a job with very little preparation. Most of my previous jobs were like that, but this company is much different and it is appreciated."
good,"Its a great organization. Excellent growth opportunity, good learning experience, good support from the management and fun loving place"
good,40 hours work week co workers are wonderful and on point there is no part of the job that is hard just have to  know what you are doing and everything else will fall in place
good,"I am so blessed to be accepted by the company as Accounting Supervisor for Accounts Receivable Shared Services which is really new to me. An accounting module in  SAGE system training helps boost my morale that I can really do the works together with the AR Specialists under my supervision. I also enjoyed the exchange of emails and Lync conversations with the financial analysts from our clients in the Asia Pacific Region. "
good,I would help customers with billing and tech support for their tv service. In the past with the company handled complants regarding loss of mail and contacting them with the result of a investigation.
good,The most memorable moment of job was when i got best employee award for my work but and appreciation. I learnt to handle team of 15 people and now i am looking forward to work in good company and career growth.

A very fun and pro active place to work in yet fantastic opportunities to be successful and build a career.
good,"I start my day by managing my teams payroll, reviewing my emails from the day prior to catch up on anything important after my shift. After this I greet each of my team members, and check on their progress towards hitting their metrics. I then work on meeting with my agents one on one and reviewing their metrics and checking the progress they have made towards improvement. I have learned a lot in my role, the biggest thing that the position has taught me has been how to hone my time management skills. My managers and coworkers are very friendly and helpful, any time that i need help  I am able to approach them. The hardest part of my job is attempting to complete all of the weekly responsibilities in a 40 hour work week. My favorite part of my job is interacting with all of the people that I work with all of the unique personalities that I encounter and relationships that I am able to build are what make going to work every day worth it."
good,"I start preparing to work 15 minutes prior for shift. Start accessing all needed application 5 minutes before, as well as log into chat to let the manager and assistance personal know I am there. I start talking calls which is pretty steady until end of shift. Early afternoon sometimes there will be a minute between calls. Those are the moments I will review information that might have changed or been added. Calls typical went a little beyond end of shift which is not an issue, I would rather deal with the issue then worry about it being the end of shift."
good,The company is awesome with some great people to lead it. The program I was working under does need work. Pay was great. Mangers were okay.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes!

good,A typical day at Convergy's would consist of clocking in on time. Pulling up all systems needed to assist customers with issues. The most enjoyable part of the job was to speak to and help different people.
good,Overall its a good place to work. There is always a chance at gaining something from the job. If you can deal with a lot of criticism then its more than a great job. At time the management can abuse their positions but then you also have managers who really work by your side.

Sometimes calls would be back to back, sometimes you would have about 20 minutes in between each one. Management was great and so were co-workers. Customers seemed to be less willing to co-operate than with regular retail jobs, but not terrible. Advancement was competitive, but I never saw anyone move to management without taking weeks of inbound calls."
good,"fast pace"
good,It was a good experience with concentrix.I learned how handle the customer and soft silk.
good,short training  but very good coaches with the live calls.good company if the contract was longer
good,"My basic job is to provide process training to new hires."
good,"good place to work just too micromanagement"
good,"My experience at Minacs was very pleasant.  The staff was always very happy and there to help you.  The management team was very positive and were always there to lend a helping hand.  The hardest part of the job was trying to understand the customers on the other end of the line when talking on the telephone.  Since it was a call center, this was required of us.  Sometimes the connection was not the best, but we always found a way to make it work.  I loved my co-workers at Minacs.  We were like a big happy family.  We always enjoyed each others company."
good,The work culture is very good and when it is up to the job security you never know the clients demand. Concentrix is no doubt a good paying company but job security is all that sets a drawback in the organization. (With awful client demands)
good,"although the management did not follow their own rules, they would strictly enforce them on agents, other than that, the environment and help you get from other agents/ floor support was good. very clean. Making calls during the day was not as hard as one would expect, and there was a lot to learn. the computer programs were easy to understand, and the training was good at preparing one for the job."
good,"Great work place, learning new things."
good,I Use To Work There As A Customer Support Executive And I Liked Working There With A Beautiful Team As All Are Hard Working And Very Responsible Towards There Works...
good,"I enjoyed working at Minacs for a little over 2 years. The Minacs team was a family to me, we support and help each other everyday and try to keep each other positive."
good,"*I helped customers with certain situations and sold products over the phone"
good,"I learned a lot working for this company in such short time. Adjusted to the system easily. Learned o handle angry customers, read the billing ledger and understand it, technical support,up selling,and scheduling. Co workers were great."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of answer phones and helping the customer with their phone accounts. Anything from transfering numbers from one account to another, to activating or canceling lines on accounts. At times it was self rewarding to help a customer and accomplish somones problems, but there were other times customers would call in disgruntled for something our team was not responsible for. Fortunately, I had one of the best supervisors on the production floor who had, what I felt, more of an understanging what her employees went through. The company kept us up to date, was understanding of medical and school needs and trained us if we needed further assistance. The only downside was the drama from the employees and at times our customers. Rumors spread like wildfire and it was easy to be distracted at work with all the recent gossip."
good,"This job was good, but I had to leave due to medical emergency with my Mother, and then I moved to FL."
good,"Concentrix Technology Pvt Ltd guided me how to interact with the customer,how to solve their quries and sell the product with proper information"

good,"Thanks for the opportunity, great environment - nice peers"
good,Worked with a great bunch of people who are now life long friends.
good,"I work in the Technical Support department so I make a little more than the average call center agent.  The hours are all over the place however once you have worked there for a while the job bids will get you a shift that will fit everyone's needs."
good,"Everyday gives new challenges and new learnings."
good,"I phone tech support is ongoing learning job. everyday is another Application that been active or the update of the software or a whole new device that came out in the market. i learned so much while i was on the phone with the customers as well as i passed more information to the customer about their own device. Its a perfect way to gain a customer's trust by fixing their phone or make it work, and from there the communication gets better with the customer while they reach their max satisfaction. my day gets better when someone thank me for doing my job and i feel good about it."
good,"Fun place to work, outgoing and encouraging managers and team leads."
good,"Aditya Birla Minacs is the 1st organization which qualifies the criteria for being called a 'Flat Organization'. Hierarchy doesn't play a part in this organization. People recognize you not for your organization but the value you bring to the table. "
good,It is a very high speed environment with a lot of stress. The management is all about helping you to succeed.
good,reach to the work login to the tools and monitor the agents calls for the client (at&t). Give feedback to the agent and fix up a time for the training.
good,a typical call center experience good ppl good overall atmosphere
good,"A typical day at work, you'll be excited to go to work coz teamwork is very transparent everybody is driving for a metrics that'll keep the team on top because being on top is really rewarding. / Management has an open line of communication and sees to it that employees are well taken cared of./ The most enjoyable part of the job is when deserving employees are rewarded."
good,"At Convergys, you will really be proud of your company. What I really like about the environment is that employees really exude professionalism. We all know that we are working as call center agents and some of us didn't even finished a degree but we all work with dignity and with our heads held up high. I also like the management.The management will really push and inspire you to have an excellent work ethics and to love your work."
good,"When I joined Convergys I was not sure and confused with my further, but as and when i spent time company is given me a lot of opportunity and trusted me. I become a Sr. Tech support office and then i started training new batched and coaching them. I like spending my time in office and making sure i complete task that are assign to me."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"convergys provides great customer service experience.. great level of trainings, also teaches the ability to muti task.."
good,very forward thinking very great staff and amazing opportunities and most of all confidence is what i gained from this company
good,"was able to learn more about pharmacy tech, and how typical pharmacy orders work"
good,"Compensation is the only complaint; however, it's a good job to start at in corporate America. Management could be better since it's really inconsistent at times. Overall it's a good secure job."
good,"I troubleshoot phone, cable, and internet. The most fun and exciting part about this job is talking to and meeting new people. Also getting their problem solved is another plus. I enjoying helping my co-workers with their customers problems. The benefits are also a great opportunity for employees."
good,"Very busy call center with performance based pay. Can be very stressful at times. Hardest part of the job is when the members do not have means to pay for their co-pays/co-insurance and/or monthly premiums, they will take it out on you, and most are on a fixed income. That applies to the majority of the calls that come in."
good,the job was ok it is just to strict on the policy but the job was an overall good job for my first job
good,"A typical day at work involves me meeting with and coordinating with various departments including training, client services, operations and clients to stream line our processes and meet operational metric goals. "
good,I really like working here. I am proof that it is possible to move up within the company quickly if you put your mind to it.
good,"Convergys was a nice job, I had to resigned due to loss of a family member and school. The schedule didn't work out."
good,Benefits and Pension plan were nice. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my colleagues and meeting deadlines in a fast paced environment.  Enjoyed meeting clients and this industry.
good,"I made 150 outbound business development calls per day.  My co-workers were team oriented and fun, we all enjoyed the challenges of being on the phone 8 hours per day. The hardest part of the job was getting the right person on the telephone, but that was off-set by getting the decision maker."
good,"The typical day at work includes advanced troubleshoothing for cell phone technology.  During my time here I learned the best practices of billing, how to communicate with angry customers and settle disputes.  The management is very good, the managers and team leads will assist individuals in moving up the corporate ladder. Co-workers are great! There is almost a sense of family in the work place, diversity is one of the principals this company is based on. Although settling disputes, replacements, and upset customers can be difficult at first, the co-workers that have quickly become my friends and experience I gained from my job have been an incredibly rewarding experience."
good,"Everyday, I would just sit in front of the computer and take inbound calls.  It is mostly about giving excellent customer service to clients.  I can say that it is a great company to work for because of the benefits and awesome co-workers.  The hardest part of the job is that we do not have a fixed schedule and it is somehow stressful since we have to reach some scores.  On the other hand, it is enjoyable because of the positive environment and the satisfied clients."
good,"Wokring with Canadian Client, handling operations team of 16 members."
good,"My work day consisted of receiving calls to assist customers with home networking or home security issues. My manager was pleasant to work for and I made some life-long friends with some of my co-workers. I enjoyed helping customers resolve their issues, however lack of training when new products were added or company changes were made it sometimes difficult to assist."
good,"I liked working there because it was new to me. I never worked for a place that had to do so much on a computer. I enjoyed the customers everyday because I enjoy interacting with people. However the whole sale on every call was troublesome, I appreciate the opportunity to learn something new."
good,"Receiving inbound calls from our customers about there orders. we make outbound call to insure that they are satisfied with the product. I learned that not every customer will be happy with their services and all you can do is apologize and try to resolve the issue. Management at Convergys wasn't terrible if we couldn't resolve an issue with a customer management would step in and take care of it. I loved my co workers were the best, there were never issues between us. We worked a s a team. The hardest part of the job was keeping everyone happy and sometimes you try your best, but the will always be one person that will not be fully satisfied. The most enjoyable part of the job was having a stress free day."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes!

good,"•	Respond to inbound phone calls and provide services to RBC customers."
good,"We all know that customer satisfaction is the top most priority. At any cost, we need to satisfy the customer. Keep apologizing, assuring blah..blah...it is just like a daily routine. But, to be honest, what we all are doing is just telling thousands of lies to them by promising something that will happen..lol. This is the job what I am currently doing in this company. NO customer satisfaction at all. I am getting salary for this stuff. That is really nice hah? But I don't like this kinda job. We need to do in correct way. So, that we can maintain the job quality, there is no quality but only the lies. "
good,"Good Company ... nice Environmment... loved working dere. DAefefsdfdsfn;n sd/l/ds sdnfsdjf sdfjsdfg sdgf"
good,"Received on average 25-35 inbound calls a day. Sales incentive is determined by how many sales made divided by calls taken. Reaching our goal could earn you a few minutes off the phone, work passes, time on the dance central xbox console, etc. I learned the value of team work. We had weekly meetings as well as individual meetings to discuss performances and upcoming projects. The team consist of a dozen of co-workers and a manager as the ""team leader"" split up into six individual teams. I enjoyed the job overall."

good,"Good place to work , great pay , customers negative but the pay helps"
good,"Great customer service job, ability to work at home. Wonderful learning experiences and great on the job training. Co workers are always willing to help you out, however the hardest part of this job is how face paced it is. I worked in a customer service technical group so it was back to back unhappy callers all day long, but it was great to turn around their day and make them happy."
good,"It was really great place to work"
good,I found myself working in a friendly and supportive environment. very good management . Product training was excellent.
good,"well i had a fix schedule unlike other Call Center Agent because i am a working student that time. My work started at 9pm until 6am and my class started at 8am. I learned the importance of time management. You should be cautious with your time and spend it productively. I like the management because they understand my situation and they allowed me to continue my studies through adjusting my schedule. Regarding with my co workers some can understand my situations while others are not.I cant help but to be bullied some times by other co workers because for them studying is no longer important because we already earning well, others even stated that after my graduation i will still end up as a call center agent. I just smile every time i heard their comments anyways they are entitled to have one while others inspired me to continue. The hardest part of my job is i need to be competitive because i need to maintain my good performance. Some times we need to render overtime (1-2 hours) per day and came late for my 1st subject. There was an instance that i rendered OT 2 hrs for almost 1 month and worked during rest days. I did that because that is my way of helping the management who are kind enough to allow me to study. It is not compulsory they just asked a favor if we can do that because during that time there are plenty of calls waiting and we need to meet the demands. the enjoyable part is team  building and pay out why?because we were given time to bond with my co workers at the same time they pay good that means i can pay my tuition fee at the rest is give it my lovable mother."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"1. about my profile at current location, nothing is much typical as got the good training about process and get illuminating guideline from management time to time."
good,"Management is particular about job and productivity and on the same time friendly."
good,"I learned quite a bit about phones, technology, and patience. The enviroment was comfortable, just a small income. I made a lot of good friends, great connections, as well as grew so much more in general. Stronger customer service skills all around."
good,"I enjoyed working with customers over the phone being able to help them, customer service is what I now love. But I'm not interested in sales."
good,What I learned is being friendly and helping people the best you know how can take you a long way in this world. Also I learned a lot about Mortgages and buying houses and living beyond your income.
good,The company is always growing but because of this change occurs quickly which can have anegative impact on the balance between work and home.
good,I had an overall great experience i learned a lot about phones & how to handle stressful situations. All of the co-workers were very helpful. Management was all was available when needed.  
good,A typical day at work was fun and layed back. I learned alot about the product DTV and got along well with my Manager. The co-workers around me were friendly and willing to assist at anytime. The hardest part of the job was not being able to leave a customer happy. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to compete with co workers on sales and winning prizes.
good,i had a great time working with them. it developed my skills and knowledge and it made me a better person.
good,I'm not a huge fan of pushing sales and being motivated every day to make a sale where I even had to write down every sale. The co-worker interaction wasn't really there since most of the time you are on the phone. Management is less the fun but luckily for me the ones I got to interact with were enjoyable. The hardest part of the job is the back to back phone calls and especially the irate customers. The most enjoyable part is that if you can really sale then your job will be that much easier
good,"A typical day at work involves answering phone calls and assisting customers with anything from helping them understand their bills and take payments to guiding them through programming their remote and locating technicians. I sharpened my soft skills and learned how to better influence customers. Management was ok. Some of the team leaders were very supportive while others are mostly interested in stats. Co-workers were great. Made a lot of really good friends. met a lot of different people. The hardest part of the job was trying to meet all their metrics while still providing good customer service. It's difficult to explain a billing issue to an angry customer, help them program their remote, call dispatch and offer upgrades to their services without going over 5 minutes on a call. Sometimes I would spend 20 minutes on a call so that we wouldn't have to send a tech out and save the company money and would still get a verbal going over the amount of time or going on my break a little late. As corny as it sounds the best part of the job is hearing a very grateful customer at the end of a call. Raises were great. Some projects were more fun than others and sometimes we'd be on call after call for the whole day."
good,"Typical day, answering calls and assisting customer with any issues they might have regarding their cable."
good,"Convergys was a wonderful place to work, however I could not continue there because I could not develope the number of points it took inorder for me to change my schedule, also it's workpace was a little fast-paced for my style, and sales were aggressive. I did love the pajama days."
good,"This company was great as far as values and benefits, there was lots of room for job advancement but in turn the management was very inexperienced when it came to consistancy."
good,A typical day at work is greeting the courtesy with a smile and respect and assisting them with their needs.
good,"It was very good, but the account with Nissan closed and Minacs open a new site location in USA. The company is from there."
good,I answer inbound calls of members. I inform them of the information they need to know or may need to know. I learned a lot about insurance policys. The co-workers are awesome.
good,"Worked in a call center environment answering phones and assisting customers with their vehicle, vehicle warranties and any problems that they may be experiencing with their dealerships. Worked closely with my team leader to ensure that all of my calls were going as smoothly and perfectly as possible."
good,"Its not a bad job. You sit on the phone all day and deal with people who are calling about their cable/internet service and try to sell them more stuff. The people are great to work with.. well.. there are some that act like high school kids, but management is great, and if you're good at attendance, dealing with people NOT reading a script and convincing people that they want things they wont use. Convergys isn't so bad....."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes!

good,"No job security. I was laid off twice in 2 years. Co-workers were great to work with. Enjoy the weekly review, so that I can always advance my skills."
good,All the metrics have to be met or else. Customers are almost always maniacs and dealerships can be pretty shady. Good culture and friends aplenty.

good,I love my job at convergy's and have met some very nice people there and the customers are great!
good,"I learned to work a team to help the customer achieve their goal. Time management proved to be vaulable and sucessful. Customers rated over overallability to help them by a questionarie. Started incentives to the overall best employee, to create fun in the workplace. I learned through hard work creates an easier goal. Updating new technology and products to our customers meaning learning and sharing the information with our clients. Management was meeting with us twice a week and we had great group meeting with co-workers to learn more about them. The hardest part of the job is disappointing the customer with new changes in company policy. The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with the customer."
good,Very friendly place to work. Comfortable environment and easy going.
good,"Great co-workers, responsible managment, while working here I improved my technical knowledge"
good,"At Convergy's Usually was getting their early to be able to find a computer, where you have to log in in order to clock in and then after everything was set up, i would login my phone and started with my calls. i got two 15 minute brakes i worked a part-time shift. Every friday they would coach us to see how we were doing on the calls. The most enjoyable port was the incentives for making sales, the PTO available for all employees."
good,It's a great place to work. You do work with different kinds of people it has it good times and bad.
good,most enjoyable part will be my co workers and the environment that the management team instill.highly competitive but still ensures employee satisfaction

good,I was glade to work in abm.I like to learn things where ever I go
good,Answered phones for Secure Horizons and Medicare AARP. I learned how to communicate with customers effectively.
good,I learned that how to work in Company Environment and how to work in a presser situation. I really feel good that I had a part of this Organization and i learned more form that organization. I can not forget that moment when all the team mates were sitting together on the floor and having fun with each other.
good,Very good company. As we all know as a sale agent you always have to keep your numbers high
good,This is a great experience to get a handle on working with people and knowing how to make myself a better person towards customers. This also gives you a sales opportunity so you can see how you stand with being a sales person.

good,"Very high paced environment, learned how to support Onstar systems,superviors were very helpful and knowledgeable, coworkers are friendly. working weekends was hardest part of job. Enjoyed having calibration meetings with management."
good,"A typical day of work would consist of answering incoming phone calls during the whole shift and assisting customers with account information, upgrades, sales, billing, and service. I've learned to be patient with people when they are upset because they just want to vent when something is not right, especially if they pay for the services. Co-workers are extremely nice and easy to get along with. Hardest part is dealing with irate customers. Enjoyable part is knowing you were able to assist someone in the way they needed."
good,I took incoming calls for a car company. Took customer's payment's and checked on account info for them.
good,"i did enjoy working there, although i'm more of a hands on take action type person since being in the navy, so to say the least i got bored with it. most enjoyable part was genuinely having the ability to help people. hardest part was talking to angry customers though it was never a problem. management was very supportive and accountable"
good,A great place to work and be a part of. A typical day would be greeting my advisors and building a relationship and providing motivation.
good,Convergys was my first job. This place will hire you if you are looking to gain experience for your resume'. It's not the most exciting job but sometimes the customers can be entertaining. Stay away from the socialites in this company! It can be very easy to become distracted. Apply!
good,"Very easy job, but it does get either very stressful or very boring at times. Team Leads do try to keep you motivated at time with activities while working."
good,Had a super great client that offered flexible work schedules and low key atmosphere.  The project ended and we were reassigned to a project with work hours that aren't condicive to work life balance

good,"Working environment is good. Agents can take some rest on the sleeping area during the break schedules. The management knows how to value the employees, they also give appraisals based on performance and tenureships"
good,It was a pretty good job and pay was good most of everyone is kind .they send you through training and it is very in sighting it does get a little hard but after your on the call floor it's way easier.
good,Good work environment. Cooperative coworkers. Cafeteria is very well organized. Huge workplace. Good management. Overall it was the finest place to work.
good,Inbound calls. Team Leads worked with you. Be there for the customer and get the work done within the time frame.Hardest part was dealing with angry customers.

good,"The most enjoyable part of my Job at Concentrix is to connect with people, I do this my meeting my teams quite often in skip level's. I also make sure that people are not feeling stressed at work and make sure I'm making that fun filled environment for them, i and my team ( employee engagement) do lot of fun activities on floor which involves associates from floor and Team leads. Its always fun to work with such amazing Team"
good,I am just in need of additional income for I have a growing family and expenses were getting high compared to what it used to be and so this is my way of looking for other means to earn.
good,It was a fun place to work and it was a friendly environment to work with and the most enjoyable part is the other cultural activities that are performed in the organization.
good,"My entire 20 months were well spent working in cnx. Management was good , work environment was very comfortable  . Mangers/supervisors were very cooperative and they really helped me to grow and taught me how to work under pressure , how to work with my co workers ,how to handle any case aligned to me. Overall my experience was awesome"
good,It's very easy but also boring. There is little room for advancement since no one in upper levels are held accountable for there actions and lack of work ethic. Basically they hold all the slots and arent going anywhere.
good,"Very pleased to learn my technical skills here working for the fruit company although after working elsewhere making twice as much with better training I realized the training in this job role as support lacks fundamentals in customer support. They are using the same support culture from the past with a company that upgrades technology and fails to deliver in upgrading the training to support customers to the highest level its disappointing because when you get a bad survey you will swear that you could have done something better but its really the lack of training. Also this company converges has other accounts they support in which I have witnessed the trashiest bathrooms you can ever imagine along with the trashiest parking lot. I have seen wanna be thugs with face tattoos try instigating fights and fights almost breaking out in the training rooms because of the lack of class in the people they hire.. If you have been working for the fruit company and you are seeing this I strongly suggest you to get a comptia a+ certification or something equivalent and use that towards you're resume to land a job where people care about you and you are not working with trashy people or a boss that will write you up every 3-6 months if you fail to meet ""metrics"".. I have gotten a write up for not putting in ""sincerely"" in my email to a customer that has nothing to do with quality so obviously every one there really does not know what they are doing other than trying to please the higher ups for a check. I have received over 5 write ups for stupid things like this."
good,It’s a good job that provides progress for the future. It all depends on the individuals determination to succeed. Management is alright. Just like any other company.
good,I liked the workplace as well as the culture there. The management was quite good. They stand strong on their ground for their ethics and vision. They do need to work on the salary front though.
good,There is a great sense of accomplishment to helping a customer through their issues. There was that same feeling of accomplishment after training a new agent.

good,"Learned a lot from the company."
good,"While Convergys/Concentrix boasts a rather healthy and understandign work environment that keeps from putting too much pressure on you at work, this job is a full time commitment. The hours are overall consistant and you’ll always know how much you’ll be working but the most common shifts start in the middle of the day, making free time a bit scarce. If anything, the company is lax and understanding and does take care of their employees with some incredibly good benefits."
good,The office was nice. Workmates are friendly and will help you to be more efficient at work. Well disciplined and strict boss but all proffesional. PNB.

good,"the job was cool, just a little stressful at times. The job environment was the stress. it was drama every other day. The supervisors adored me but HR had it in for everybody for real."
good,"Paid training was nice, instructors took their time to teach and were very hands on. We had an 8 week paid training before taking real phone calls. They had a party when we all finished training, and everyone brought something to share. My class had Mexican food. It's a very fast paced environment, but lots of people to help you if needed."
good,"I loved working at Convergys, customer service was a goal for me. It was a fun and competitive environment and I still have very close friends from work. I started on the phones with customer service, inbound and outbound sales calls. I was promoted to trainer for the local phone service and then became supervisor over 3 teams. I worked long hours, I worked under stressful deadlines, but I enjoyed it and it brought out the best in me. I learned a lot about customer service and my motto is still ""Treat others like you would like to be treated""!"
good,I like working at convergys now concentrix. I have been here a little over a year and am now in a higher roll. The people are nice management can be either good or really bad. They do give you paid breaks. 30 min lunch. There used to be a lot of awards for keeping out stats up but that changed with change of management. Other than that it's a good place to work. And I depends in what department.

good,"Being employed with Concentrix has shown me my strength and capability of learning new technology , it has been a challenge. I do have recommendations that staff should be evaluated closer rules put in place that are beneficial to the company as a whole. and that there be more staff meetings."
good,Convergys was my first work place and I have learnt many things from here. As a fresher I learnt how to handle tremendous amount of pressure of work and do your job with ease.
good,it was a very productive place to work at. you would use a lot of communication skills with your patients. the managers would take good care of you and your coworkers
good,"Focused on the work and the customers."
good,"It was on live calls at location taking live calls "

good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"A typical day of work was something I looked forward to accomplishing each day. I learned a great deal about taxes, accounting and running small businesses. The management was great; they were friendly, and a great resource to get questions answered. The hardest part of the job was pin-pointing exact causes of problems with particular aspects of the software. The most enjoyable part of the job was the team environment."
good,"Not that bad good pay just really mentally draining, and repetitive work. Overall easy job wouldn’t really recommend unless you really need a job they hire pretty much anybody"

The only issue was the schedule changed weekly it was never consistent and they promised unlimited overtime during my hiring process which was only available for a few weeks until they cut the OT all together.
good,"Working at Convergys is like working in any other call center company, most of the work is repetitive and tedious. What makes them different is that they convey professionalism and have better facilities. They also try to make workplace more enjoyable from time to time thru their gimmicks. The pay is adequately higher compared  to other companies and they make sure that you are compensated for your hard work thru their incentive schemes."

good,"The company itself is great to work for, but some client contracts require more than others and sometimes management cannot uphold to the proper requirements leading to inadequate support to the Advisors.....Continued training should be consistent with the client needs. Management control definitely needs improvement...Overall the company is a great place to work for."
good,Overall it was a great experience . I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good full time job . I would even go back if the opportunity presents itself.
good,Good working envirent with good leaders that teaches us more on how to improve our skills in doing our job daily. Hardest part is dealing with irrate customers due to interrupted services.

good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes!

good,"While working at Convergys it was fun and challenging. The people you meet are usually friendly and very help-full when you need information or if you have and questions. The challenge come from trying to hit the recommended number of dials per day while keeping a good call quality score. If you hit both of the recommended scores for the month, expect to see a bonus next month. Over all it is a good place to work. Just remember to scheduled any days you need off in the system using your PTO and to call into work and notify them if you cant come into work, to avoid getting a no call no show."

good,I enjoyed my time with Concentrix.  Great training and wonderful clients.  Management was very supportive and encouraging. I enjoyed the opportunity to assist customers in resolving their issues. The hardest part of the job was shift time I was given on my last assignment.  I was unable to continue to work full-time and was unable to wait for the next shift bid to change to part-time. In retrospect I should have asked for a part-time position at the beginning of the new assignment. The benefits are great and the opportunities for advance are varied.

good,I would get to work 30 min early so I had time to sign into my computer and get signed in before time to clock in.

good,It was a wonderful experience working in a fun and productive environment. It feels like your office is your second home because of the people that surrounds you. A typical day at work is opening your work tools like your email to check for any updates from your manager and clients. I have learned to be confident in dealing with technical people and being independent in delivering my task. Management is the best if not one of the best in the field. They treat you with respect and it almost feels like they are not your superior. With regards to workplace culture I can say that you are working and having fun at the same time so I can say that it lessens the pressure in your job.

I've learned how to become a technical expert, provide resolution in one call send reports to our client, set up appointment, and encode job order details to be sent to technician.

The hardest part of the job is retaining the customer or making them stay with the company. due to a lot of competitors and better offers outside . though its a challenge on our part that's why it is the hardest. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you resolve customers issue and made them satisfied."

It was indeed a great experience assisting customers and was also a training ground for me to involve myself in their problem and work with the best resolution that could help them out.

The management could be kind of scrambled at times and when you needed assistance, they weren't always there to help you make the sale. They have a nice breakroom area with ping pong tables and a small ""cafe"" of sorts which was nice. Be prepared for a random schedule, as it can flip flop on you at times but overtime is always nice! All in all, not a bad place, you just need good customer service skills and lots of patience with the mean customers who can come across the phone daily but you have to look past that and not carry your work home with you!

My interaction with Comcast executives is an experience in corporate executives that understand image issues who are working positively toward improving that public image. Comcast is in no way the corporate ogre that the media and the public envision.  Comcast serves millions of customers who rarely have an issue with their services.  There are a certain small percentage that truly do have issues and Comcast works hard to resolve those issues.  Technology has never been, is not and will never be perfect.  Working with Comcast is a rewarding and growing experience."

The ironic part is you spend 4 weeks in training, and you are watching powerpoint after powerpoint of information that is repetitive and often times only covers about 10% of the actual job."
good,"My experienced in Convergys helped me a lot in dealing with different people. I've been transferred a couple of times to different accounts but for me, that's somehow an advantage with regard to being exposed to different set of cultures and management styles."

good,"I worked with Convergys for a short time in their work-at-home division. It was definitely a solid place to work that focused on doing right by the clients and their customerbase. The only disagreeable aspect was the culture I interacted with, however I feel that might have had more to do with the client I worked with, a company known for cutting corners and disrespecting their customers, rather than Convergys itself."
good,"Its ok place to work, is mainly suited to young workers."
good,"As I mentioned that Im a sales Representative so we have to deal with different customers with handling skills. "

I learned a lot in my previous organization about time management and how to maintain a work life balance. Management at the work was very much supportive in terms of helping in learning new things taking care of different projects and all. Hardest part of the job is to maintain a balance of targets as well as customer appreciations as well as the same time. Interacting with different people is the most enjoyable part of the job.

The center is designed to take complaint/information seeking calls from customer's regarding their Chrysler/Fiat vehicles.  I was a Case Manager specializing in radio concerns, updates and developments. I would assist customers with issues with their radios and if I could not resolve the issue I would act as a liaison between the customer and the dealerships and follow up on any repairs that needed to be done to ensure customer satisfaction.   I enjoyed speaking to the customers from all over the US as I am in Canada and it was an interesting part of each interaction.  My co-workers were wonderful and my supervisor was incredible at always letting my know of my performance.  I was there for 2 years and I received a quarterly bonus check for each quarter from the day I started until the day I left.  The hardest part of my job was when I had to resign.  I was told I was always welcome to come back at any time."

good,"a typical day at work is fun especially with my team."
good,Convergys was good for what I needed at the time. The environment was fun and I made many great friends. The work and knowledge has even improved my daily life with how I interact with other people.  Basically you would be fine if you showed up on time everyday and tried your best. The down side was that unless you got a promotion to an operations manager there wasn't that much advancement. Most of the pay advancement came from attendance awards.
good,Enegentic work place with many bonus oppertunities. Fast paced and independent. Great support from the managment team.
good,"Well, everything was working good with my previous company which is Convergys. The people in there like my manager, supervisor and of course my workmates and friends. I treated all of them as my family. We work as one. Everyone was cooperative that would help you enhance your skills and do your job well. The hardest of the job actually started last January. They've advised us to do overtime everyday. And as an employee, working 11-12 hours a day isn't really good to ones health. Well, Everything was good. Not until they hold the bonus incentives that we should get on those overtimes. But then summarizing everything. I really did enjoy my job."

good,"Working here was a real pleasant albeit stressful at times experience, the training was sufficient enough to have us taking calls with confidence. the pay was above average for the area. I answered calls each day from customers with problems and it was my job to find the solution they needed. My job was to make peoples day better. I guess the hardest part of the job was the customers I wanted to help but was unable to. I just didn't like letting a customer leave without a solution."

good,"My opinion about a typical day at work is being cheerful always, like smiling to start your day, a good vibe is needed to make your day at work more productive and hassle free. I have learned how to become more efficient and to help my colleagues that contributes to team work. The best management always produce the best teams and camaraderie.

I got much better at communicating, and working fast and productively while still uphold a positive image of yourself, and therefore also the company. My co-workers were all positive, upstanding people with all kinds of different backgrounds and nationalities. Outright great people, all of them. Mangement were all positive and were always there to help, listen, and doing good with upholding the productivity, positivity and the good standards of the company and it's employees. If something negative were to occur within the workplace and/or company on the other hand, it was rather difficult to engage in intellectual discourse about it, which I will say was the hardest part of this job. If the employees spoke up about something, they would not be given the time of day, and even the most ""outspoken"" so to say could be dismissed on this basis. "
good,"Our main goal is to provide quality service to our customers with the use of our resources and following the rules of the company. I have learned lot of things especially with how their products are working and how to do some basic troubleshooting that we can share to our customers. The management is really taking good care of their employees. The supervisors are very approachable and will really help if you are having hard time with what you're doing. Co-workers are very helpful also. They are very encouraging and of course, very fun to work with. One of the hardest part of the job is the shifting schedules but you'll get used to it. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with great people who can help you to improve yourself."

Offer healthcare and other benefits after 90 days of employment and a raise in pay. Overall experience is not too bad."

good,"I love Mondays, mostly because the day flies by in a flash. On a given day, during the early hours you will find me speaking to the clients, finding out – proactively – what their priorities are for the week, meeting with team for half hour to communicate the clients’ needs and organizing the team schedules around the client’s priorities. I do this on Monday so that the rest of the week is well organized and we can effectively use our team’s time in exceeding client’s expectations and avoid Friday evening surprises. Rest of the week goes in delivering the product(s), updating the status with the client, answering emails and calls from our global teams. My role involves extensive management responsibilities and staying organized is not an option."

I loved the hours because they always guaranteed my 40 hours a week. I'd spend 8 hours a day sitting at my cubicle taking phone calls from Eyemed members and providers wanting to go over benefits and authorizations for use of benefits. I'd happily oblige and worked as fast as I could because of our call handle time which is supposed to be about 3 minutes and 20 seconds. I got pretty fast at it after a while and it was fun. A couple of months later I got promoted and was trained for a week on how to handle claims and the billing part of the insurance agency. They taught me how to review claims and how to look up what the insurance covered, what the patient should have paid, and what would be reimbursed to the provider. They also taught me how to remove or edit claims. I got removed from my position because I failed to HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) verify the callers information before giving out information. It was an honest mistake.

The management itself would really want you to maximize your time, regardless if it is your break or any unwanted downtime due to technicalities with the system. Initiative is also a key component while I worked for Convergys. Not  everything in the account was spoon-fed. You really have to pull your own weight, discover techniques within the account and track your daily trending to ensure consistency and excellence with your work.

good,this company provided great wages and incentives. there was plenty of room for job advancement.

good,Typical day of work is Part time or Full time hours taking Inbound Calls.
good,"I always enjoy my days at work no matter what happen, its always a second home. I learned so many thing at work, such as how to deal with customers, co-workers, the bestr thing is to promote the company, like I use different type of language to sell the product for my company so i can stay in my job. etc...I see my position at work as a privilege, to upgrade my professionel skils, helping others, provide soe facts to my customers. In my opinion work its always fun, sometimes I may face a different day, that's not mean hard, but I always stay the same calm person to face any issue. I enjoy my work, specially when Chrismas time or new year Eve, its a new beginning for anyone of us as a co-worker, customers."

good,"Work was very steady in a days run, there was very little down time and whenever help was needed it was a click away."
good,"Good company to work with, good working hours, pay is descent. It is a bit hard to find management when dealing with an escalated call but other than that the environment is great."
good,getting ready to begin inbound call and helping others co-worker that may need my attention. i think the hardest part of the job is back to back calls in the line waiting.
good,It is a very possitive environment with alot of possitive co workers. They really care about the workers along with the satisfaction of their customers. Really is a productive and non violent place. No drama is enforced. I really enjoy working there.
good,Basically read and answered emails whole shift. You could wear headphones and snack while working.
good,"Typical day at work is taking about 100 calls in a day, answering calls about the Postal Service. I have learned about everything there is to know about services with the Postal Service. The co-workers are great and know exactly how you feel if you are having a bad day. Hardest part of the day is when you are not treated badly by the customers on the phone. The most enjoyable part is the co-workers."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes!

Convergys IM was sold to NetCracker Technology in May 2012. There are many changes in taking place to the organizational structure and to the expected roles and responsibilities. Overall, it is still a good place to work, but changes are being made which could change the working environment for US employees."
good,taking phone calls for att customers assisting with bills new services
good,I answer calls at the center hate sales I really do I'm very shy never in my life would I have thought that I would enjoy talking to people all day but I do even when the people call in completely rude and won't have it listening to a thing you say calming them down is an awesome feeling or having them hang up but every once in a while YOU WILL get a call that makes you want to throw the headset out the window ha but its not as bad as people make it out to be they work with you very well I'm grateful to have a place to work. Points are high at the moment still even if tomorrow I dono't have the job I've been blessed to have it this long
good,"I started as a customer service representative and moved my way up to supervisor.. I learned from the start on what our reps mean to out customers and having accurate knowledge is key to satisfying anyone who calls with a issue. Our customer is the cornerstone of any business, without them we wouldn't stay in business. They must be satisfied no matter what. I enjoyed solving a difficult issue for a customer."

good,pretty nice place to work. 8hrs of sitting managment was nice not a hard job
good,"Convergys in Pocatello attempts to assist it's employee's in schedule changes for school or home emergencies. This family value attitude makes it a great place to work. It is a large Company but as an employee they make you feel like you matter to them. The job can be stressful as you deal with clients that are frustrated and angry. Assisting them in finding solutions for their issues is rewarding. I am a ""show me the money"" kind of girl so the fact that my pay incentives are reachable is important to me. I believe management can make or break a call center. Pocatello Convergys is lucky to have some wonderful people in leadership. They create a family enviroment and want to see their employee's succeed. I had no intention of staying at a call center as I have a degree. I have been there two years. The pay is not bad, the incentive pay is obtainable and the benefits are decent. There is alot of opportunity to move up in the Pocatello center. Unfortunately, most of the positions do not come with an increase of base pay equal to the additional responsibility. Call centers generally have a high turn over because new employees learn they are not suited to the call center job and quit. Over all it is a good place to work. All it takes from me is a positive attitude for my day at work to be good!"
good,come in and find and seat clock in and start taking calls. we would communicate through the web. Management was ok as well as the co-workers. The hardest part of the job with some irate customers. The part that I enjoyed the most was satisfying the customers.
good,Extremely good Microsoft Training Experience.
good,"Great people work for this company, most management included."
good,this position required me to give friendly and professional customer service to call in customers
good,Really enjoyed my job was able to help people but the employee wasn't willing to work with its employers
good,"a typical day at work is answering phone and proving grat customer service. mangement is always finding way to improve your work . Co workers are excellent , they are so muchfun to be around."
good,love working here! i love a challenge and here at convergey. they were not very good at working with you when it came to appointments and school it was full time so i understood
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Good Paying Job, A little strict because they will require for us to sell products. A very busy job but good enviroment."
good,I love the company they treated you like family and worked with you any way possible.
good,Great people!
good,I wasn't with the company long but I was pleased with how everything turned out. I'd been doing customer service for years face to face so the phone was easier to handle problem customers. I had a good relatinoship with management and probably would have persued management had I stayed. The hard part was needing more income. The most enjoyable part was making some lonely or distressed persons day better by helping them.
good,A day at work consisted of speaking with cable and interent clients about there accounts. We would receive several calls with upset clients about disconnection of services. I learned to have patience with this job and how to deescalate issues.
good,I would clock in at the appropriate timed and take inbound calls.
good,Receive incoming calls for desktop support. Transfer calls to Tier 2 if needed.
good,"I enjoyed being able to help people with their billing issues, I learned that I can be compassionate and understanding under stress. My team lead kept thing's fun, My co-workers all had the same goal and that was to help our customers and each other. The only hard part about the job was learning new systems which did come in time. I think the most enjoyable part for me was knowing that I helped a customer who called in really upset and by the end of the call was much calmer and happier."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of clocking in and taking calls from customers who wish to either cancel service or have other customer service questions about their AT&T wireless service. I learned a lot about how to handle angry customers and that looking at the overall big picture can often times help correct the little, more immediate picture, which can also help retain a customer in the long term. If we can correct an issue we can see as small at the moment before it gets to be a big problem, then that will help make the customer happy. They may not always call in for everything that is upsetting them and may be giving you a different reason why they are upset all together. Finding the root cause to a problem and doing sub-probing can go a long way. The management staff there, for the most part was very helpful. Most were very friendly and there for their employees. The co-workers were good as well. We have a department of approximately 800 people, 350 of which are Telecommunication Agents working at home. The hardest part of the job to me is when i have a customer that is really upset and there isn't anything i could do to help them within the policy when they have an issue. The other hard part about the job is that one little mistake by spelling a word wrong in one of our systems can cost you a lot of commission. They expect you to be perfect, which isn't always the case. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping others around me be as successful at this job as i have been. The other part i enjoy is when i have a customer who calls in and is upset about something"
good,"I would receive inbound calls for Onstar either welcoming customers to the new service and offering deals on calling minutes and capturing credit card numbers, or would be providing general onstar service. With the welcome calls there was bonus incentive based on the number of sales, as well as required sales goals. The job was very enjoyable as I got to introduce people to a service most found very interesting, though I was often moved from contract to contract so it was hard to adjust to one position."
good,A typical day at work was always a fast paste environment.
good,"I worked for the US postal service, it required a security clearance so if you can't pass it, try for another account. The DirecTV account pays squat, but you get free DirecTV. The Postal Account pays a little better, around $10-$11/hr, but you get free insurance. It really just depends on your account. The crappiest thing is that your have to fight for you seat and your schedule is sporadic."
good,It was a place where I could utilize my customer service skill through helping with internet problems as well as phone service problems. I learned the basics of how to trouble shoot the internet when it is not working. Management was fair as well as caring. The co-workers that were there for a long time had no problem in helping those of us who did not understand some things. The hardest part of the job was learning all the many steps in trouble shooting the equipment. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I did accomplish getting a customer back up and running.
good,"taking calls and assisting customers get their problems solved. if problem couldnt be solved, schedule a technician to go out to the customers house and physically check what the problem might be."
good,"There are better call centers, but this is a great way to determine if this type of customer service suits you or not. ABM provides security in the form of 401K, health insurance, dental insurance, FMLA, optometrist insurance, full time work, and an illusion of self efficiency."
good,I enjoyed my experiences at Convergys. I felt like I was part of a big family. Everyone was nice and willing to help and in cheerful spirits.

Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"An ""Awesome to work for"" company. good working atmosphere and the best clients in the respective industry."
good,"I wish I would have never left. Great company, for the most part, great people. Call centers get a bad rep, but with the right management, training, and a good caring attitude you would never have a bad customer service experience."
good,"Convergys has very flexible hours, and days. Perfect job for a student, or someone who has physical limitations."
good,"its a good place to start, and management is really good, team-leader is help me a lot. also lots of motivation during the work, just salary is  a little bit low."
good,"Overall Concentrix is great place to work. Managment seem to care. Hours are flexible. You do have to work weekends but I don't mind that."

good,"Concentrix gives you immense opportunities to grow as it has vast number of processes ,though life is a bit hard there but that  can be neglected when u get good culture and environment which the same offers ."
good,"I was able to learn and develop as a leader in Convergys (Concentrix)."
good,"I love concentrix, I was apart of the company when it was previously Amina a- apart of transitional concentrix and when celebrating opening of additional building. However, the pay for the work that’s expected to produce is not ok. I work in prior authorization for prescriptions then promoted to resolution and as a supervisor received a 50 raise which did not equal to the work that was required."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"I suggest this organization for the beginners who ever wants to start their career in bpo sector u can trust, good learning and growth opportunities. It gives u the capacity to achieve rest depends on your performance."
good,Se puede ascender de manera constante en distintos puestos
good,"The workplace is relaxed and orderly. Security is great, as client confidential information is taken seriously. Although the management is sometimes detached to the employees resulting in slightly harder work-load, it is still manageable and they listen to employee feedback. The work is fun and engaging."
good,"I gave 1.4 years to concentrix with complete dedication to my work and customers as per the client's set policies."
good,"The company and managers are pretty good, but the content of work was makes me upset. There are many customers said they only want to talk to Americans, or ask you where are you come from then they want to talk to my manager who is American."
good,"The management could be better, but its still good overall with good employees, nice and fun place to work, but if your looking for more competition and a raise then Concentrix may not deliver, but if you want something stable and consistent then I'd say Concentrix will be for you."
good,"Concentrix is a good company to work for they have all kinds of jobs and world wide, plus they have at homes jobs as well, your job is customer care for different companies like apple or at&t"
good,"It would have been a good place to work if they had of actually taken care of the building, the place was almost falling apart, there ws ticks and lice in the carpet it was gross."
good,"Benifts from the company is really awesome "
good,The pay is very good the hours are great. The work schedules are good and very convent for me the job is very much a easy task. I gained my experience working this job.
good,"No issue, I got a lot of good experience from working here, and it has helped me improve my job career. The management staff and support staff are truly amazing, they take pride in helping you reach your goals."
good,One of the best call center experiences in Wichita now that Concentrix has taken over. They negotiate contracts with all in mind and are working hard to be the best in the industry.
good,"This place was a good place to work starting out in customer service. The people were nice, has a very chill environment although some people are a little extra, this job was simple, and the pay was good. I would recommend"
good,"This is a company which takes care of its staffs with highest priority, is growing rapidly in size and revenue across the globe, innovation driven initiatives, excellent leadership"
good,Nice place to work. It is a good platform for freshers to start there career.  Shift timing is very much convenient. Supervisors and managers are very much supporting.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"I have to admit, I was skeptical about working for Concentrix. There were plenty of call center horror stories about how stressful the job could be, and how awful people could be over the phone. We were trained up and sent out to the floor, and there was definitely a sink or swim period our team was unsure of. After some more time on calls though, this has definitely turned into a very nice job. As long as you know going in that it is a customer service role and that it will be intense at times, there is no reason you cannot be good at what you do here. There are comprehensive benefits, great leaders, and quite a few advancement opportunities to be seized. The company also offers jobs at different locations if you are trying to move, and you can apply internally if that is what you are aiming for. Overall, I will be sad when I have to leave this place, if I ever do."
good,"I enjoyed the job it self, I also really enjoyed the management team. I had a great time working for them. They were very understanding and personal able. The benefits could have been a lot better."
good,fine place to work.  Good team leads and understanding upper management.  Enjoyed my time at the company and they are good about calling you back to come work the seasonal assignment.
good,work was a typical job management could of been better work culture was good they were all types of people hardest position was to sell minutes the enjoyable part was i was sitting donwn on a computer
good,"They mostly rely on your performance which is actually a good thing, but I hope immediate supervisors have extra ability to manage to handle personal issues of their associates. "
good,"Encouragement of growth within the company. Over time is available, flexible hours and they are willing to accommodate your schedule. Friendly environment."
good,"Great call center to work in , definitely pay you great hourly rate of 12.50 an hour . Great benefits, awesome 41k program. Great with giving over time. Flexible schedule!"
good,"The company was my home for almost 10 years, it was my comfort zone. I learned a lot on how to be professional in every aspect of work. There is an open door policy so you can always talk to the managers if you need them. Employees are constantly appreciated by monthly recognitions with freebies."
good,"Overall the pay aligns with the labor of the job and the benefits are great, however the management and some of the people that are put into management roles are far from stellar. The communication is lacking which is what I believe the problem is within the company. All of the meeting and greeting that is done upon hiring do not continue throughout the course of your time at the job because managers within the same departments do not all share the same knowledge of employee issues and requests. It would take far too long to sum everything up and express my dismay with the structure of this company. If you’re hired here just keep in mind that you’ll have to really chase team leaders, mangers and HR down to accomplish anything you request (I.e. sick time off, mistakes on paychecks)."
good,"For six (6) years in the company, My experience was exciting and very challenging. I was able to explore my knowledge and working experienced in different aspects in life working in the BPO industry."
good,Convergys Philippines Inc. has a good working environment. The company gives out different opportunities as it promotes diversity with the employees. It is also a great opportunity to learn from great people.
good,Working at Convergys was fun. My manager was always willing to help us succeed. Lots of contests and prizes. I was not very good at being aggressive with customers to keep their service if they wanted to stop it. Upper management did not like that
good,"I handled a billing account for a satellite company before with CVG. Everyday we handle billing , general inquiries and basic troubleshooting."
good,I like working at convergys. IT was outbound calls really like it because time when fast. Some of the challenges was people having bad service in there area.
good,This company provided me with the opportunity to grow my career. The management is good and they are always looking for way to unsure that the employees are engaged and satisfied.
good,"Great environment, awesome benefits, lunch room and break room is perfect. Everyone minds their own business. You get to wear comfy clothes and sit in comfy chairs."
good,"First of all there is no ping pong table I have no idea why that was in this spot before I started typing. My honest opinion is it's a good place to work. Pays well better than your typical job, about $11 an hour which is definitely livable if you have no dependents other than yourself. I do want to mention that management does play favorites and if you find yourself on the wrong end of that spectrum things can get bad fast. I am one of those who sees though stuff and then tends to put a target on me because I have a tendency to speak my mind. For example: I worked as a customer service rep for just under 4 years for them, I was used as a Supervisor for one of those years.... but without a pay increase. They would have me undergo the responsibilities of management yet they would keep me at level of Agent under the guise that they are using me as a backup Sup. Yet they used me almost every day. At least 4 out of the 5 workdays each week. After a year of this I went vocal about it, the result wasn't me getting the benefits my peers took advantage of the past year but a demotion, they stopped using me as a sup because they could no longer do it free. I'm not saying its a bad place to work, just be aware of the politics that go on there."
good,I loved working for Concentrix. The people were always so helpful and kind. I appreciate the level of training and dedication the work at home group provided  to see their employees succeed.
good,This is the best company to work with however there were some action plans that they applied that will made you think if the company play it fair to their employees.
good,"Convergys was a great employer, Concentrix has just bought us out, so we don't know what the future holds.  So far, it has been good, and hopeful for the future."
good,What I truly loved to this company is the security they provided to all its employees. You can assure that you are secured inside the ops. The salary was always on time and as well as the finalpay or the backpay.
good,"El ambiente laboral es ameno, ya que trabajas con gente de distintas edades y culturas lo que hace que exista mucha diversidad y comprension entre los empleados, coordinadores, capacitadores y administracion."
good,Better than most of the call centers here in my country ;)
good,Its good to work in Concentrix but the main problem was salary increment never done even if we completed one year with good quality score. But overall it is great ahead to work in concentrix and a learned alot of things how to work sincerely and patience.
good,"This was a great company to work with.  Our location struggled with sales which led to the site closure."
good,Been a great time working at this place. I have met some of the best people and learned some serious skills. This place is a huge community provider and has treated me very well.
good,I worked in convergys for AT&T process which is US based. I found the work atmosphere extremely cool and celebrating. The floor was always full of Fun activities as well as mass work production simultaneously. It is so far the best work culture I have witnessed.
good,"Great Place to start out, Helps the employee learn computer skills and billing skills. provides methods on how to talk to angry customers  keeping them calm as you fix their billing issues. the staff over at converges are really nice and show a great amount of Knowledge at their profession."
good,"I liked this job, in spite of the heavy push for sale -- I worked for DirecTV with them and the most awesome thing about that was that employees got the Premier package with all the premium channels plus NFL Sunday Ticket for FREE!.  I'm more customer service oriented, so I did well as far as customer satisfaction; I just wasn't good at upselling and that hurt my commission.  Also my kids weren't quite old enough at the time to understand that mommy was working and had a habit of being noisy in the background.  They're older now and I would consider doing this type of job again."
good,"Everyone helps out each when possible, some floor supporters help you out, others will just have you figured it out in your own. You get to wear any type of clothing must be appropriate"
good,I would recommend this job for most anyone. Working from home is great for self starters and Convergys offers many lines of work that you can transfer to after 6 months.
good,"Only issues I ever ran into were with direct specific managers, while needing to take medical leave. It was nothing against the company, nor how it was ran."
good,"• I work 8 hours a day with 2 15-minute breaks and an hour of lunch."
good,"1- I use to deal with both types of customers  sweet as well as irate so i m confident enough to handle such pressure"
good,"Over all a good place to work. At times stressful. Still I love my job there just low pay scale. The job is a sit down job. No dress code. Air conditioned. Break room, little snack shop. Monday’s are free munchies."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"you can enjoy your work as well have fun in the work place"
good,"people are great, management is good same with my benefits. i like the workplace because of the location. Manager's and Supervisor's are easy to approach."
good,"Being in BPO industry usually work at night shift, and time management is very important, You should not be late even a minute because it will affect your attendance occurrences."
good,"Convergys was a Ohio-based outsourcing organization that has several call center operations worldwide, and many of his clients included express delivery companies (FedEx), the United States Postal Service, and Untied Healthcare. Like other call center organization, the objective was to provide first-call resolution for customers. The most enjoyable part of my job was to leave the call with a customer feeling satisfied with a positive experience."
good,"I worked at stream / convergys for so long"
good,"It's like any call center, but I really liked the managers/coaches that I worked under."
good,"+ Ha sido el call center mas serio y profesional en el que he trabajado."
good,It is a very good organisation and i'm glad that i was a part of it. They are paying a good amount to fresher on a domestic processs which is rare to get in this industry
good,"Prompt arrival is unquestionable, arriving on time is late 5 minutes. Log in your computer and within 10 minutes you're taking calls. If you have training necessary, your team lead makes sure you have time off the phones to learn the material."
good,It as a honor and a privilege to have had the opportunity to work for Concentrix.  I had the experience of working some amazing people.  I will miss working at the company.
good,"In Convergys, we are asked to multitask, We take calls, resolved customers concern and record everything at the same time. Management is good as they are hands on to every employee from the agents up to supervisors and managers. The company also has a great culture as they make sure that all the employees are well trained, and the company always has the best service to our customers. The hardest part of the job is working on a graveyard shift though, after a week or two, your body and mind will really get used to it not to mention that we also don't need to fight through traffic. The most enjoyable part is you get to speak to different customers, mostly Americans, and you get to practice the universal language. I also enjoy the challenge of every calls, as it also helps me learn and help at the same time."
good,Convergys makes sure you can keep up. The training sessions are great and makes you informed about the company and the procedures to be done. The people are super nice and working everyday with your team is a work worth waking up to.
good,Straight forward. They allow overtime. Paid time off. They offer discounts for some apartments across the street. Must have patients to deal with customers

good,La empresa es flexible en horarios facilitando el estudio.
good,"Learned Client Management, Team managing Skills. Overall a good experience with Concentrix. There are few things which needs improvement like there is no consistent appraisal cycle every year it gets changed."
good,"i really enjoyed working here, very quick paced, but paid very well and that's what i liked about it, many people work here, you can dress how you want."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,It was very comfortable and time managing.i with to be able to work there again someday. I was able to make sells and meet new people I enjoy my team on the floor and being able to talk to people across the world.
good,I was hired to work a new (temporary) program.  Most of my job required work from home so this allowed me to be home for my daughter which was great for my family.  The company itself takes good care of it's employees and offers competitive benefits.  Unfortunately the program did so well that it's ending earlier than anticipated.
good,"Responsibilities "
good,"I worked here for the past 6 months and the big plus is the management wants you to succeed. Besides the issue with stress and being almost impossible to get a raise, I think Convergys is a great place to work"
good,"In my opinion i think convergys is a great place to work. you put in your forty hours a week with adequate pay and convergys offeres other things that most entry jobs dont like, Paid time off, unpaid time off , insurance and local food discounts."
good,Fair employer with good pay and benefits. They offer great incentives and give opportunities to learn and advance. If you are patient and are willing to learn and do not mind sitting for long periods of time you will do great.

Able to put a smile on customers face for helping them with there situation. And the more important very flexible schedule for students. In the summer, students can do full time and anytime they can switch to part-time."
good,"Prior to being acquired from IBM, concentrix has found ways to integrate its culture with the best practices from IBM. Having done that, what you have is a diverse mix of best in class services, fun-filled work environment and a support system that enables its leaders to develop their potential."
good,"Aprendí mucho sobre el manejo de los seguros de salud en Estados Unidos y no solo mejore mi servicio al cliente sino que también aprendí a realizar otras tareas que en mi empleo anterior no realizaba, como hacer llamadas a diferentes entidades no relacionadas directamente a la empresa en cuya cuenta yo trabaje, realizar diferentes tipos de cartas que se adaptaran a las necesidades de los clientes y también adquirí habilidades de análisis y encontrar la mejor solución para todas las partes afectadas así como a abogar y llegar hasta la ultima consecuencia para ayudar a los clientes a resolver sus problemas."
good,Training is good. Easy money. Could take a little more time to develop the sales aspect for those who are not sales-minded. Once on the floor it is sometimes difficult to receive the help needed but whether waiting or talking or researching you're still getting paid. So there's no need to get uptight. Convergys has 2 clients. AT&T and Wyndham. Most likely you'll be picked for AT&T. Wyndham only hires twice a year or so. It's relatively easy money. Start at $10.50/hour in Cruces. Just show up to work and you get a $500 sign-on bonus split up in 2 payments over a 5 month period. Other bonuses include sales bonuses and Rep satisfaction bonuses. Occasionally they allow overtime also. They have games and contests on occasion... It's overall a decent place to work. What job isn't stressful in its own way?
good,"Working at Concentrix has it's pros and cons like any job. The training is always great, great sales incentives and the managers and teamleaders are accomodating and helpful. The reason I am leaving is becase of the phone calls themselves. "
good,Company was good. They pay attention on their company staff first. They provide job related security as well. Good environment for job. Good management.
good,"Working at Convergys, was fun and fast paced. Convergys subcontracts for AT&T, which gave me access to customers all around the United States. The room for advancement was quite awesome and they boosted employee morale quite often."
good,"Working with company is fine though there might some bumps but overall it is still fine. "
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes!

good,Convergys is a good place to but salary not really competitive.  Its great to have half day Fridays. Most employees are friendly along with most of the management.
good,Training new people for customer service was always challenging but also rewarding. Being able to role-play was the always great. The most rewarding part was seeing each student excel and take live calls with ease.
good,Convergys helped me a lot in terms of communication skill and interpersonal skills as well. They have exposed me to the customer service industry wherein I was able to obtain a lot of info about it. They helped me improve my skills in customer service and in talking in english as well.
good,I enjoy the work and work environment.  I am fully supported but leadership. There is room for advancement within the company. I have no complaints with Concentrix.
good,A relaxed atmosphere where its fast paced and competitive.  fun competitions as far as sales.  team work makes the dream work. great benefits and vacation
good,i like the incentives every month and it's easy to achieve as long as you maintain a passing scorecard. they acknowledge what you achieve. the hardest part is the schedule for example this week you have 2 days rest day by next week you have split off.
good,"friendly security guards, good pantry, beautiful recreational room. The management is good. There are some activites you can enjoy with. There are shower rooms and the quarters are nice"
good,place to grow with immense learning opportunity. people friendly organization with total job security. At times working might be be pressure but the benefits are long term.
good,"it was easy to learn the process. I have learned how to be with a professional manner, we user enjoy our work, we use to have incentives on the smart work we do"
good,tyipical workday would be a morning meeting with my team to ensure we are all on the same page and working towards our goal. Ilearned how to lead effectivly and also how to manage different personalities. Management was the best part had some of the best Co-workers who where friendly and very team oriented. hardest part of the job was leaving due to losing the project. The most enjoyable part of the job was showing up and hitting the targets we needed to hit as a team.
good,"I enjoyed working for this company. I worked for Ryder, which is the longest standing company in the building. Management was excellent. I also enjoyed my co-workers. Also, with having so many other companies along side us, there were many employees and we all worked side by side in a respectable way. All in all it was enjoyable. Sadly, I needed to leave due to medical purposes."

good,"Working at Convergys was not a bad gig. The hours were good, I got to pick what I wanted. The pay wasn't horrible either for the area I lived at. Everyone was nice, management always was available for help."
good,"Convergys in the Dominican Republic is a great place to work at. You have to opportunity to grow, and have fun at the same time. Even though it's a fast moved placed and under stress, you will love every day of work thanks to the great managers and supervisors."
good,"Overall nice experience. Comfortable working environment.It is a commonly known fact that if one person is feeling down, they bring everyone else down with them. Negativity is contagious, and it can have a detrimental effect on the workplace. Not only does a negative environment cause employees to be unhappy with their jobs, but it makes them less productive.Im just looking for recommendations of other operating systems which would be suitable for the task."
good,I enjoyed Convergys. They have great incentives to get people motivated. They provide a snack area. They give pizza parties. They have lunch room with tv and an internet lobby for breaks.
good,"Es buena, buen ambiente de trabajo y salario competitivo."
good,A professional environment and a good learning opportunity for freshers. There are a lot of fun activities to do which will keep you entertained it's just that the shift hours are too long.
good,It was a great job to work at but the employees was horrible. To childish. Never had a professional attitude or service. So I left because I'm way better and deserve to be around more people like me
good,"You get out of this job what you put into it. If you are wanting more than just a paycheck, then you'll need to put in some more effort. If you are putting in good effort, present for your shifts, doing well with your job, and staying positive day in and out, they will recognize this and will help you advance. Make sure that your wish to advance is known by management so they know what direction you can see yourself moving and where they can help you out. Even if you don't want to advance but just get incentive bonuses, they will let you know what to improve on to help you succeed."
good,"This Organisation was very good organisation in my life, because I learn many good thinks and also get the knowledge regarding how to enjoy with my life and how can i take important decision in my life...."
good,It was nice to be with the company that only wants its employees to grow. The supervisors and the trainers shared their work ethics to guide me in my career.
good,"My job is to get in on time and open up all my programs on the computer to start at 5:00 am. I answer phones all day and usually I take in over 200 call per day. I learned to listen and I did not take it personal when people were upset because insurance did not pay for medications and they blame the pharmacy tech at the call center. "
good,"On a regular basic Convergys is having a employee engagement activities such as Bingo, a raffle draw. Our management including our colleagues are really kind and professional."
good,"The opinion of this company depends heavily on which division you work for. I was hired to work for the Charter Communications Technical Support team, and thoroughly enjoyed my job. I worked full time with Convergys as a full-time student, and they were very supportive in terms of working around my class schedule. The training was fun for me, and the content is not difficult. Before you receive any calls, you are well-equipped to handle them through classes and drills, as well as shadowing sessions with more seasoned employees. This is a good, reliable source of income for anyone who doesn't mind being on a phone for eight hours!"
good,"I worked for this company for two years. The workplace is fun. Bosses are cool. Even if the job itself is a bit hard, it becomes easy as I have great mentors like my TLs and SMEs."
good,"Convergys is a great company & I enjoyed my time here, made new friends & learned many different programs. Training was a little rough seeing as I've never been in this field of work before and the people who had made it difficult for new employees to learn due to interruptions. Also the team leaders could be very short tempered at times and would often leave us on the floor with no help."
good,Working experience was nice. Good work culture and ethics. Overall nice experience with Concentrix. Also found employee friendly environment. Good company to work with culture and customer satisfaction.
good,"Convergys taught me so much about work culture and improved my professional behavior. There is so much to learn here, Learn things here, improve yourself while having fun with your team. Enjoy the work."
good,"I have learned harware and software troubleshooting,giving support to third party devices,configuring settings of,PCs,laptops,etc.the best part about the job was that there was no compulsion of formal wear,but yes you have to wear decent casual wear.break freezing was very annoying though."
good,"Buenas instalaciones, buen ambiente de trabajo general pero se tornaba difícil por lo supervisores los cuales a veces daban la impresión de no saber lo que hacían. En algunos casos caían en abuso de autoridad y acoso laboral. En terminos generales la empresa como tal me parece bien, el único pero es la gente que eligen para dirigirla la cual no siempre fue la mejor ni la más experimentada."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes!

good,"help existing customers with their needs, taking inbound calls. majority of the calls last about 30 seconds on average. "
good,"Convergys Baguio is the best work experience that I ever had. I learned many things like dealing with customers concerns and personal lives. Differentiating sympathy from empathy and their culture. Sometimes I cannot understand them because of language barrier but I was able to cope up with them. Working as a customer associate is not as easy as they think because our performance affects their businesses and their lives. I remember the day that I was a trainee, whenever I receive  a call i feel rattled and nervous because it's my first time. Until then that I was able to familiarize myself to the whereabouts of the work. and I was able to handle them properly. I was really greatful to be part of this company."
good,"Although the salary is not the greatest, if you consider what you would spend on transportation, lunch and wardrobe, it works out great. The scheduling is very flexible."
good,"I handle the world's largest search engine account and it's easy. The management is very hands-on, appreciates the employee's work. The facilities are great as well."
good,".back to back calls "
good,"It was a good company working with. Great working environment , great team leaders, awesome staff and working environment was having fun with work all the time"
good,"They provide us really good facilities,"
good,I run a team of 20 agents. I am responsible for coaching them and showing them how to provide the best customer service for our client and to me our goals. I also do a weekly team meeting which allows me to disperse any important information given to me by upper management that my team needs to know. I have learned from this job how to coach many different personalities in many different ways because no one human being is the same and no one call is the same. I love the challenge of putting those pieces together and figuring out how to keep my team at the top at the same time. The hardest part of my job is having the challenging conversations and letting an agent know this not working and taking the phone calls from the customers that have already spoken to an agent and someone above them and now they are speaking to me and expect me to give them a different answer when I really cannot.
good,i learned a lot from this company. they treat people with utmost care and respect. the upper management are helpful with the employees and they are willing to help the wmployees achieve their goals and dreams.
good,"The best part of job was helping people with understanding their insurance. "
good,"It is  great feeling to work with a big brand , work culture is good , providing the both side transport facility which hard to find these days, management is upto the the mark .hardest part is the long login hrs and the salary benefit is not upto the mark"

good,"During our 5 month internship in Convergys, we gained lots of knowledge especially in Human Resources."
good,The workplace is very noisy & fast-paced at times. The workers are very nice & will help new trainees with anything they need. Management as well was friendly and attentive.
good,"Convergys provide you the exposure and work as per your ability. You can switch lines through internal job postings. This is one of the best thing, they don't hire people from outside for management."
good,What I like the most in this company is the working environment. Management team is dedicated and is always willing to help. Overall they made my stay in Convergys worth while.
good,Nice place to work. Convergys itself is a very good company but the management is not that good. It is fun having a laugh with Teammates and going out for a team building is fun after the pressure.
good,"I recently retired from CVG after 9 years. I left the company not because of issues with management, etc but because of personal matters. Everything in Convergys has proper process and new policies such as scorecard changes are explained properly. i will definitely come back if I have the chance."
good,"I have improved my conversational skills during the internship period."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes!

good,Working with Convergys was fun cause they not only offer good compensation but they need to make sure that their employees have the fun to be motivated in working.

good,Love everyone in management! They are what make this place a easy going and fun environment. Very hands on and helpful environment no matter what the issue at hand is.
good,My typical working day is full of fun. I have learned the basics of customer service. The management is very hands on and the workplace culture is collaborative. The hardest part of the job is dealing with codes used in billing records but I enjoyed dealing with customer queries.
good,Working in a call center was very fast paced and friendly.  You had to maintain a professional balance even though co-workers did not.  Management was very helpful and cared about your concerns.
good,I only missed 2days  in two years and was late once. I liked my job it was easy and great pay . Hardest part was getting yelled at by up set people the ones you worked with
good,"I enjoyed working here. Management was awesome, pay was decent, and the benefits were good. Sometimes the work could be monotonous but it was worth it."
good,Co-employees are nice and jolly. I prefer not to say anything about the management. Good working environment. Competitive salary. Employee recognition keeps  us motivated.

good,"Our manager trains us very well and patient when giving us instructions. Also, my workmates are very approachable. We typically start the day by 8 am and ends it usually from 6 to 8 pm. The hardest part is finding applicants who are qualified for the position. We can only find a little but still we thrive do find most everyday."
good,"Convergys has a great salary and benefits package. It's also a fun place to wok as team leaders and the operation manager see's to it that team outings are done at least twice a year. Employee recognition are done here too, making the employee feel appreciated in their work."
good,really friendly people everywhere enjoyed working and seeing everybody there.  extremely diverse work environment which I liked. I learned all about cell phones and the AT&T products we sold. Also I learned a good amount about Direct TV and more on how cable signals work. the hardest part of the job in my opinion would be coming up with a solution to as why direct TV would be best for you if they already had the services and didn't the best experience. The most enjoyable part was working on a team with so many diverse people and making so many new friends.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,My experience in Concentrix was very good and I could learn a lot from my job profile as a dental reviewer. This will surely help me in future to excel in other health insurane projects.
good,"it helped me developed my communication skills and analytical skills. The management is great , allowances and incentives motivates me to work harder."
good,"The company provides flexible working hours for as long as all deliverables are met. The culture is very warm and encourages new employees to be involved with the team by ensuring that their is an immersion with all of the departments at the first week of reporting into the job. The work I have also allows for travel as support needs to be provided to other locations within the Philippines, thereby, allowing exposure to other groups within the same geography."
good,"Its easy to move up at this job, as long as you have good attendance and good statistics. It pays decent. There is a learning curve when you first start. They definitely could approach their training program in a different manner. After a couple months you will be a pro at helping customers. Really there is never a boring day here."
good,i really enjoy working at here just not enough hours lots of new things to learn all the time. easy going company they will help you when every they can for accommodations
good,Productive and fun - not the best having to deal with customers all day long who get angry at you because they didn't back up their iphone but other then that and the low salary the job is okay
good,Typical day of my last position I fulfilled the responsibilities kept on me at work. Good team work will always lead to a success this what the management thought me. Hardest part of the job is the Quality.
good,"Convergys in itself is a great place to work. A/C, enormous break room, and extremely nice people. I can easily say that it was the first job I liked my co-workers from the start. Was it stressful? Absolutely, was it worth it? Definetly"

good,"For 1 year and a half, I can say that I enjoyed my stay in the company even if there are a couple of hardships I encountered from the customer's issues to the management's environment. The hardest part of the job was maintaining the scorecard while hitting the target/standards of the company. On the other hand, the environment was just blissful as able to make memories with my colleagues. I've learned that you need to have a lot of patience in this kind of job as you have to deal with different kinds of people and their issues. Also, you have to do your best to be able to reach your goals."
good,concentrix gave me a new life where i learnt lot from the process which made my mind physically strong. work atmosphere is very good which is completely surrounded by tough competitors around & management is held with huge responsibilty on each & every individual agents working where we dont get time to think about other  activities going outside of the floor.

Theme based events and competitions are constantly being done on a monthly basis. No dull moments when you are in the office. It's the main reason why I am still working here until now. However, competition is very tight and career growth and promotion is sometimes based on politics. The one with connections always get it. I still want to expand my horizon and become successful and be able to share my talents and skills with other people. Somewhere where I can be recognized based on my performance.

good,It was amazing to work for the Convergy's Corp. it showed me alot. It is fun with great benefits and the people there are just so friendly and outgoing. On the time that I worked there everybody was so helpful and they helped me throughout my time there.
good,"Convergys is a very well run company who cares for their employees. They ask a lot from their team members however they do reward them with compensation, free lunches, prizes and more!"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,I like working for convergys for the most part. There are somethings they as a whole need to work on but all large companys do. I would go back and work for them in the future if the opportunity arose.
good,This company was great and I loved working for them. The management was approachable and the schedule was flexible dependent upon performance. Room to grow and advance within the company.
good,"This was one of the best jobs I've had. Every day was a challenge, and I left feeling accomplished at the end of every shift. I developed great business relationships with my co workers, and recieved many positive escalation calls from customers who wished to tell my manager how well I was able to assist them."
good,Convergys is a very big corporation that offers work opportunity. Its not the best to work for but its not a bad place to start working.
good,"Many facets to this work enviroment. They give traing on skills that will be needed. Provide computers and operating systems needed to do the job. Management gives feedback on job performance. Most of the time its positive, with advice on how to make it better the next time. The bonuses that are given out are adaquate to the job performance. Vacation and benifits are the best thing about Convergys. Some schedules can be flexable."
good,A firm which takes care of its Employees whole heartedly . When I joined this company I was already in my 30's and the HR had to think to take a decision about my hiring but they said we know you would serve like a candle light to youngsters. Their confidence in me motivated me and hence would like to mention that Motivation is there at every step here.
good,"I enjoyed my time working at this location as there were many things to do for the client, not just take inbound calls. My boss' saw that I had Avaya phone experience and they used that tool to assist their ever growing business to make the place a smoother and more client focused work environment. Loved my job as a Senior Resolution Specialist. If I had the opportunity to do it again I would do it in a heartbeat for this company."
good,"A good place to work, Takes care of workers well being. Encourages worker to put in their best and get rewarded."
good,its a nice environment with colleagues and the managers also really good and overall working  here is good. And the people here are very supportive.....
good,"I am working with concentrix from last 5 years and it's been great to work with this organisation. However , my only regret with this company is that there is less growing opportunities (but that is also process specific) and also less Salary. Rest there is good environment , job security and also friendly environment which one looking for. Happy to work with CNX.. :)"
good,The training was easy And worth the easy pay. There are definitely times you are slow and bored but everyday is different. It's a good job for someone's who needs something fast.
good,"Fairly good communication with the management team, fairly good schedule and fair salaries. This job created a lot of stress because it established goals for customer retention and also for sales of equipment. The employees had meetings with the supervisors to review the goals and also got training to help them to give a good customer service and support."
good,"I have worked with concentrix for more than 2 years and I have enjoyed alott. This is not only a work place, it gives a very good environment to employees."
good,"Overall good organization to work and learn new management and other challengees, just they need to work for salary structuring that is not appreciable salary increment is provided to the employees."
good,"i miss working at a factory personally but this job is not terrible, a lot of good people work there and you opinion matters. the issue lies in the work, i'd say i'm a people person but if i'm being honest 1 bad call can ruin your day. The best advice i could give about the line of work is keep a think skin but be kind and considerate."
good,"Excellent environment, friendly management "
good,I feel that concentrix is a fun place to work if you match up with their speed . They stand strong on their ground for their ethics and vision.  They do need to work on the salary front though.
good,"Working with concentrix is very good experience we can  learned lot of things from concentrix. The process is good, company I very big. Seniors were a bit co-operative. Cafeteria is bit expensive."
good,"Culture is good"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Office was near my home. Easy to travel i was flexible with shifts. Managers were   good able to understand the problem if there were any issues. I never felt that the work pressure. Good.
good,I worked with Concentrix for 2 years. And It was really a great experience to work there. Management is good and employee centric company. Best organization I have ever worked for in terms of job security.
good,Best place i ever worked should've paid me what others started with since we were doing the same job. Should've given better raises. Good place to work i loved my manager she was the best.
good,Convergys was a great job with the pay and the work environment. The people where great to work with and it was a steady work flow. I loved it and it got me to where I am in my work now
good,Good workplace. The people are really good. They are all very helpful. Its for those who dont have anything and want to do something or for those who just want to progress over there and love what they have to offer.
good,"Worked for convergys before. "
good,"Fun place to work, management is supportive! Everyone is supportive of each other and want everyone to succeed! Talent is recognized and hard work is appreciated!"
good,"every weekend or even every month, they present the most important issue in the company and the actions made to address those issues through fun games and activities to agents so they will adapt it and used it in a fun way through calls."
good,"This job pays you a good amount for the work you are doing. You get to sit and talk to people all day and be comfortable, but it is sometimes draining and can become repetitive. If you like call centres, this will probably be the best one you can work at. "
good,"Great place to work but it is closing in the fall, this was an amazing place to work , manages are so kind and help you if you need them  good people is how I describe the managers"
good,"el ambiente laboral es bueno, ya que es muy pacifico y las personas son muy carismaticas"
good,Concentrix Is A Very Easy Paced Company To Work For. My Department Has A Very Excellent Group Of Team Leads That Care About What Your Going Through Outside Of Work. They Are Very Understanding. Flexible Hours That Accomidates Your Schedule Which I May Add The Department I'm In I Make My Own Schedule and Select My Hours. However It's Too Many Young Folk With Attitude Problems.
good,I't was a great job great pay just was seasonal and i loved it was easy and well  taught and showed the right way. was a great everyday 8-4 job had a lot of rotating and schedule changing but the most part i loved it basically you can write Ur own check.
good,"Great company, good benefits, the furniture is always top notch, perks are xmas staff party, free drinks, summer party, good rates of pay, options to travel"
good,"I enjoyed working at the concentrix. "
good,"Good work environment, excellent pay, advancement opportunities, friendly management, good hours, i really enjoyed working here. i loved the environment and how the company took care of their employees"
good,Concentrix is one of the best place to start over the career. Very friendly management and its ensures every employee works with fun and ease to continue and make a career growth
good,"Wenn man gute Karma Punkte sammeln möchte, dann ist man hier bestens aufgehoben. Außerdem ist man vor Monotonie sehr geschützt, da ständig neue Ideen umgesetzt werden."
good,Good company to work for. Good length training. Team leads are very busy though so asking for help or getting questions answered is a little harder.  But overall happy there.
good,"It was a good place to work especially as a beginner in customer service, you will learn the skills to be able to go to work at another call center to do customer service"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"you go in get on the phones immediately to take calls, very professional voices, also need to be concernes about the customers feelings, wants and needs, the first manger i had was the best manager i have very worked for, she was very patient and understanding to everyone's needs"
good,"change of agency of our company Concentrix."
good,I worked with this company for 15 years and was impressed overall by the quality of management and career opportunities provided.  I would recommend this company to anyone interested in developing customer service skills.
good,"It is a nice company to work with, gives you lot of opportunities to explore new things, There training program is very good, as this is a BPO, you get to interact with new people throughout the world."
good,"Superb and just fairly fine, if only my salary will increase i will definitely stay, this company promotes good work experience and allow people to grow according to their skill and capabilities."
good,I was happy with the job that I had working there the company has undergone some changes and there's a new dress code in effect starting in January. the job is a good job if you are looking to get off your feet
good,"One of the best BPOs in India. Offers you great exposure and help you shape your personality by various training programmes. Once you've spend some time with this company, you will get many growth opportunities as well."
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with and the work itself was challenging which is something I look for. The atmosphere was relaxed and allowed a person to learn from their mistakes.
good,The training course could be longer like 3 more months longer and the exersises that the trainer gave us we never went over it as a group. It was fast-paced but the other employees were very nice.  Sometimes the calls were 2-3 or 4 hours long.  It was too much info to take in even though they said it wasn't bad at all.  I never made it to the graduation of the class it was just too tough to take it all in.  So I went to another job. The first week of training class was fun though.
good,I enjoyed working at Convergys. I met a lot of good people. The job really kept you on your feet. It felt really good to be able to help the customers.
good,"A day used to pass in no time but it used to get opposite in nights. Although, the night shifts were little tough but way better for understanding the process and self improvement as it was the peak time for US and UK customers and helped in improving the communication. The management was good and took care of the requirements accordingly and provided many fun activities to cope up with the work pressure. The most challenging part was to sometimes control the inside feeling and heading up to the work with a great positive energy even if mood is low as it could affect the customer experience which was no justice for the job place. The most enjoyable part was receiving recognition for all the hard work and complete focus towards the work."
good,"talking to customer about there concerns."
good,Fast pace Technical support very high call volume you havecto be willing to work and proviee exceptional customer service and support also attendance is a major factor
good,"Staff at Concentric were easy to speak with and to approach. Most of the employees are also very helpful and friendly. The only concerns are the system issues and lack of information sharing, which is standard for any call center in the industry"
good,Convergys is a great place to work. the environment is very friendly and everyone works together to succeed. It is a tad boring at times as its a call center and I'm an active guy but besides that its great!
good,Security and authentication is the most important part of my job with Convergys. I enjoy the unlimited overtime and understanding from various managers when my granddaughter died. The hardest part is that I have to relocate and leave this wonderful place of employment in Colorado.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"As when i joined Concentrix it was really great and good as everything was good the environment, the culture, the management and also people. But after some couple of months as company started putting pressure for sales and also no incentives and bonus was there. Everyone has to pay their bills that was not happening in this salary"
good,Very simple job if you have basic computer knowledge and can handle people on good and bad days. Good job security and advancement from within. Pay is pretty subpar compared to other call centers in the area.
good,"I had the privilege of working with top-notch colleagues during my stay as a Command Center Associate at Convergys Philippines. They provide a lot of great training, team buildings, and the management was awesome."
good,very helpful in terms of honing your communication skills and how you interact with customers helps you as well in terms of patient and temper control
good,"You definitely get out what you put in. The company offers good benefits, and will take care of the employees, but when the employees come in with a nasty attitude then it makes the working environment difficult. Management has a hard job to do & but they will take care of their team if the team takes care of them as well. "
good,I feel that it makes the job to stressful when they only worry about quotas instead of trying to properly train people on customer retention. If they concentrated more on that they wouldn't have such a turn over rate.
good,"I looked forward to work everyday. Great Management, staff, always evolving, growing and renewing. Collaberating efferts worked as tight teem. Mutural respect. Everyone worked at mking it run smooth. Best job I ever had."
good,"My days there were very productive, i had several projects (ATT and DTV) customers that i needed to oversee.  It was a great experience for my 1st job i was a able to learn and grow with the company which they also provided schooling for my department (IT Services)."
good,"I worked on graveyard shift, thus it is somewhat a little con because it is not the normal working hours but good thing the team I am with is so much fun to work with as well our clients and management."
good,Convergys is definitely a good company to start out at. There are many oppurtunities for advancing on the career track if that's somethign that you are looking to accomplish and if that's not your speed its a great place to have a stable job.
good,"I am working for the past 3 years . Allows transperancy , free to share own view points. Good work atmosphere and employee centrix.. Keeps priority  to client"
good,"Great Working Environment With Benefits trainer was the best classroom really clicked and management is excellent, everyone is there to help when in trouble great opportunity to grow"
good,The overall company is great to their employees. It is always a teamwork besides working with different nationalities. The management is supportive and fair to all the employees.
good,Contract position that is ending. Been a great experience. Great management support. Good pay and benefits. Good work life balance. Would recommend anyone to apply.
good,"Convergys war eine sehr nette Firma, das Lohn war weder schlecht noch super, aber man brauchte nur hohe Englischkenntnisse, Grundkompetenzen mit IT Systeme und eine nette Haltung zu den Kunden um effektiv zu sein. Es war aber schwer (doch machbar) jedes Anruf in kurze Zeit erfolgreich handeln zu können, aber dazu könnte man selten mit den Mitarbeitern reden und Bindungen mit ihnen herstellen. Die Managers oder ""Team Leaders"" waren immer da, deswegen gab es nie Mangel an Leadership. Persönlich habe ich sowohl meine Englisch-, Computer- und Systemkenntnisse, als auch meine Kommunikationsfähigkeit verbessert."
good,"I had a great 6 month contract and wish it would have been for another 6 months or even more. I enjoyed the leadership we had as there was a Team Leader and his supervisor as well. On many occasions we were visited by both and given contact numbers, should we need to talk to them. Each had an open door policy so to speak and I was comfortable with both of them. No pressure added and I'd work for them again providing the pay rate stayed the same."
good,"Convergys is the best company I have worked on so far. I have the best boss and workmates. The job is sometimes tiring and stressful but the thing is, I have learned a lot and I became a better person personally and professionally."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,I have enjoyed working here thus far. The job requires you to be self sufficient but anytime I've had issues my leads would promptly help. Overall I would recommend this job to anyone else.
good,"Good company, work environment is also good. There are so many activities for holidays. They through party n all. They have diversity program as well."
good,"Typical work day, taking incoming calls to assist customers with managing their bank accounts. I learned a lot about money management, I also learned about fraudulent transactions and fraud reporting. Management could have been better with communication with the employees and ensuring that we got the correct information to do our job in a timely manner. There was nothing i can say that was hard about the job. If you know how to follow directions the job was fairly easy to do. What i found most enjoyable about the job was my co-workers. I really did make friends here and I loved the unlimited overtime"
good,"I enjoyed the job there, The managers and my coworkers were nice and easy to get along with. Everyone was helpful. I had opportunities for a lot of hours in overtime."

good,"I worked with CNX for 20 months and it was a great experience,"
good,I learned how to communicate well with the customers and also learned how to be patient and calm when I encounter hi-rate customer. The management is fair with other agents. What I enjoyed most is when the company threw events for the agents to enjoy even while working.
good,"In a technical support role, you can expect it to be difficult, but there are SEVERAL avenues to get the help you need.   Alot of room for advancement as they promote from within."
good,"The working environment at Concentrix (HQ in Fremont, CA) can be very quiet and this can be bothersome for some people, but the company is very laid back and has a great work life balance for their employees. They allow you to WFH."
good,"I like the fact that you were given incentives for your job performance"
good,The management is excellent. Working environment is very conducive. The facilities are high-class. The salary  compensation is average but its worthit.
good,I had so much fun working in this company since this is my first job ever upon landing here in Manila.Everything was so much fun for me though sometimes we cant avoid the fact of getting extended hours to render especially when the account is in need of more signing on hours but on the other hand still its a fun environment for me
good,"Concentrix Is a good company to work,management is very kind to it's employee,"
good,"I loved my job at Convergys. On a typical day you come in clean your work space and clock in. The calls were fairly simple and I loved helping every member that called in, even the angry members. I loved the feeling of being able to help someone in a time of need and being able to make their day go a little better"
good,I learned a lot in this company not only to do sales but also to communicate wisely and properly to customers. Its really a great job and I'm really happy with my Team leader and co- workers while I'm here.
good,"Receiving and Dealing with all initial customer communication, Providing accurate information and advice, remaining calm under stress full situations, the most enjoyable part of job was when customer would appreciated on call for satisfactory conclusion"
good,Easy going company. First call center i worked at and i enjoyed it very much. Competitive enviroment but they make competition fun. It does get tedious and monotonous after a while. Free tv.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."

good,"I liked working there because I was able to deal with a lot of different types of people, which made the job more interesting. Time went by really fast. The people were very friendly"
good,"Convergys is, no doubt, one of the best in the country. Great compensation and the best by far in terms of employee relation. A great experience indeed."
good,Gives you the ability to push yourself while serving others. Convergys  offers unlimited overtime and wonderful health care benefits. success will be at your rate of progress.
good,"A typical day at work is working with time management to be proficient in every area of the job.  I am always willing to learn and eager to provide what I have learned and to apply my assets to your company. "
good,"Convergys is a great place to work. Management is friendly and willing to work one-on-one with you to help you with work/life balance. The high call volumes are a bit stressful, but what call center isn't. You receive weekly coaching to gauge your performance and improve call quality. Team Leaders, Operation Managers and even the Site Director are very enthusiastic about the work and strive to provide as many bonus incentives as possible to motivate employee performance. However, schedules are not fixed and employees may be forced to work a flex schedule depending on call volume per day and you may be scheduled for mandatory overtime."
good,A typical work day consist of talking to Business Professionals and or their IT to keep the program we support up and running. We are a close nit group. Great managers in our area. Other Clients of the company I cannot speak for but The client we work for i feel has the best management. High security though cannot mention the clients name due to policy.
good,I worked tech support for Convergys. It was a fun place to work very laid back. Only downside for me was that I drove 150 miles round trip. Management was fantastic.
good,"good place to work, most higher ups were their to help if you had an issue/problem whether on the job or personal.Tools for learning were sufficient, work environment was upbeat and positive.. hardest part of the job were the customers that got on the line yelling and cursing at you, my other issue was learning tech support.. but once i was shown how to navigate the system and access my tools it was a breeze!... the only thing I did not enjoy was employees would be switched to different departments a lot sometimes not by choice. And shift scheduling is all over the place"
good,"It was an alright place to work. It has its perks and you learned alot of patience working at Convergys. Getting people to their destination, selling them minutes and helping them update their GMC vehicle."
good,"I worked on 3 different campaigns, each one had its pros and cons."
good,"Concentrix provides all the services and there is nothing negative point that I can state about the company , gor me it was a great experience. The cab service was great."
good,"Mangement could use approving"
good,Empresa com bom ambiente e colegas de trabalho. Mas alguns team leaders não tem competência para trabalhar no comando de equipes .

good,"Though I wish my salary did not match my experience or length of employment, I loved the company.  It was a balanced work environment, management was very understanding, the job was not overwhelming, and it was a place you enjoyed showing up to.  I was very grateful to have found a company like this to work for 9 years."
good,"The supervisors trained us really well. They were there to help answer questions, but also allowed us to learn from our experiences. As long as you are focused on working and not socializing, then you will succeed."
good,I like to work from home. Other than the company shirt from the client you can wear whatever you wanted.Pay was good.You need more training time and more management available to help the team.
good,Process orders via the phone and handle any and all technical issues with the companies equipment. Set up and start different account for customers and help with all issues to resolve and complete 100 percent customer service.
good,What I love about this company is that the team leaders and the bosses are great that they most of the times go to their employees and asked them how they're doing. They make sure that we always provide excellent customer service.
good,"It was good working with Concentrix India, management was helpful throughout."

good,The training was short and it was alot to learn. They try their best to work with you and help you move forward. There wasn't alot of mentors around to help when you finished your training. It was hard to get a hold of people. But It would be different now than before since the company changed
good,"I was able to add several skills to my resume with the freedom to learn and shadow given to me by my manager.  It's a great place to work.  The hardest part of the job is the high volume recruiting.  It takes a lot of patience and persistence, but your team is more than willing to help you."

good,"A typical day working at Convergys consisted of learning new things about troubleshooting and helping customers who would call in if they were having problems with their Comcast TV, internet, or phone. I learned how to run a computer very well and how to troubleshoot someone's electronics or Wi-Fi. the management team at Convergys was pretty good. although there was a few times that I asked for help and my manager never really slowed down to help me understand things that I didn't. The hardest part of my job would of been trying to get the problem fixed in a matter of seconds when it would take a couple minutes to complete right. The most enjoyable part of working at Convergys would of had to of been working with friendly, positive, and support people."

A typical day included virtual training via demonstrations, group involvements, research and exploratory job discovery.

good,I have taken a lot of calls in this job. Yes most customers were very ignorant but it was understandable for the simple fact that there phone or other device was not working. I have learned a lot of things about cell phones and how to treat customers and always tried to find a solution to help them out. The co-workers were friendly but there were some that caused a lot of issues through my time of being there. I really enjoyed the team I was on and the supervisor was very good at his job.
good,"A typical work day at Convergys would have to be answering the phones, taking payments, sales, giving information to customers, and learning more about a company. I learned how to do all of the above and doing it by multitasking. The management and co-workers loved to help you succeed with the company all you have to do is try your best."
good,"I have been working for Convergys on the Comcast project since December of 2013 and I can honestly say I like it. The biggest drawback is I didn't feel completely ready for production after training but once I got into transition and production, it all came together. Something I can say the company as a whole needs to work on is getting more floor support for the WAH agents. The wait times for an answer while you have a customer on the phone is incredibly long. There are plenty of opportunities for point earn backs, over time and extra hours. The benefits are great and if you work a Saturday/Sunday shift, you get shift differential which is a dollar more an hour. 401K, vision, dental, and health benefits are a plus to the employment."

good,"I liked the environment of the call center, sitting at a desk and taking call for 8 hours a day. It was steady paced work and I enjoyed the pay. Also was able to make more with sales benefits. What I dislike most was that the management was not so concerned with our customer service as with our sales numbers. It felt as if I was constantly being pushed to make a sale but I hadn't satisfied my customer yet which made the sale harder to make."
good,"I can say a typical day at OnStar, is dealing with customers who request cancellation of service, and trying to convince customers to keep there services active on every call. What I learned is to be patient, calm and confident in every situation. I came across, as far as management goes. I can say my team leader was helpful and understanding always gave me positive feed back on my performance when needed. My co-workers were great to work with, I couldn't ask for better co-workers. The hardest part of the job is trying to convince  the subscribers to keep the service active and coming across irate customers. The most enjoyable day is how well my performance was as far as quota and average handling time."
good,Training was very sufficient and helped me out a lot with handling customers calls. Management was very nice and was always willing to help. Co workers were awesome and Every helped each other out with issues or concerns when on the phone with a customer. Great place to work for college students.

good,"This position was customer service for the United States Post Office. The work ours were great, pay was good and the benefits were awesome. The hardest part about this job is that I prefer face to face customer service and I was not able to really get up and move around. This position taught me a lot about customer service"

It offers paid time off and non-paid time off, and tuition reimbursement. Supervisors usually work with you on your schedule to ensure that it'll work around other responsibilities like school. It is quite busy so you'll end up doing a lot of talking with customers from the beginning of your shift till the end.

good,"teams are welcoming, Team Lead are responsible and approchable and the tenured agents are masters of their choosen trade and most likely are reflect of how their Team lead thought them"
good,"Work schedule was very steady starting out and stayed quite busy, but maintainable. After a while, hours started to get cut back and then a lay off notice for long-term employees such as myself and then hours were cut in half for the last two weeks I was employed.No help whatsoever trying to get on with another ""program"" and if you did then great, but if not, it was too bad. Really not good for people who were looking for a long term job with job security and a depending upon them just like they depend on you to show up to work. Holding up to one side of the bargain does not cut it. The co worker were very helpful i you needed help with something and managers would try to get to you in a timely manner just as anyone anywhere else would, but again, no job security whatsoever and that I can not do."
good,"Management is great down to earth people. Always willing to help,  very knowledgeable."

Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"what a lot of people don't realize when the apply at this location is that the projects offered here are sales based, I was hired for wyndham side and overall it has been a great experience so far, the only issue is that the office is shared with at&t and that means we have to follow a lot of their strict policies. Breaks are short but for the call volume we have on average its not a problem. the location only does inbound calls, and the break room is equip with a canteen market."
good,My last job was fantastic...... there is very sefty for girls...... i was very comfortable on my last job..... there was not any  issue related to salary and any other things.....

good,"Working remotely is a great experience, however the systems that are required to work from home are faulty and constantly going down. The IT support time is anything but that, and constantly places the blame on the user."
good,the management is very concern of the employees health and benefits.The hardest part of the job is generating ideas most of the time finding alternative way. The most enjoyable part of the job is to see how successful the activities is.

I would also have to keep up with the new rules and plans Rogers had to offer and learned to cooperate, negotiate and overall enjoy talking with customers."
good,Great place to work. Nice coworkers and management. Convergys has a great location that is around a bunch of restaurants for your lunch breaks. It's a great place to work overall.
good,"Working with Convergys has been one of the greatest contributions to my being. First, the transition to working on a graveyard shift was never easy, but in time, I got used to it.

good,"its really good company n fun loving work, over there all employee are good n salary coming on time means its before time also sometimes but never late..."
good,"It has really good benefits, attendance policy is really strict but overall the income is great. A typical day at work for me is clocking on pulling up our systems to assist our customers when calling in for issues. What I am still currently learning is being a in a sales environment typing on a day to day basis taking notes on the customers needs. Management at Converges is really disorganized. Workplace culture is formal attire and professional attitudes. The hardest part of this job is getting a feel for the systems to assist customers when they call in. The thing i enjoy the most is offering our sales getting to know what the customer is like just from talking to them."
good,"This company wasn't too bad, but if you work here I highly recommend not working for At&t. The customers can be very rude and some times the associates you work with can be the same."
good,Every day was a struggle but  we came up with ways on how to go about different issues that the customer are calling for and that paved the way for every employees to become closer and for me that's the highlight of my stay in this company.

good,"Convergys is one of the best company, and good place to work. I have learned to be professional with managers and team members. All the co-workers were nice and helpful. The Hardest part of the job was to do double shift, that was challenging for me but i got used to it. The most enjoyable part of the job is, we team members had fun during work times and award function. We celebrated 5th Anniversary with NetApp clients all the way from US."

good,Work culture and team management were relay good.  I have thoroughly enjoyed my career in Concentrix. Best place to Work.
good,"It's a call center job. The department I was in was fun. They have great benefits and have worked with my school schedule. Hours can be crazy at times but they try to make up for it.

good,"steady job, fast paced work environment. opportunity to advance if you work hard and stay long enough. consistent hours and shifts"
good,"At Convergys, every day was always a joy to come in to work. There was always a friendly environment with co-workers that always made you feel welcome at your job. Each day was a fast-paced environment of assisting customers as a Customer Service Representative. With that, I had learned a lot with not only computer navigation but as well as memorizing Standard Operating Procedures to best assist agents and customers' needs. Management was always a great experience as any needs I addressed with them were always resolved and discussed further with me or my peers as well as always receiving feedback for praise or constructive criticism. The hardest part of the job was communicating any issues encountered with the customer's order for the project I was in. What I enjoyed the most was always knowing that my peers were always able to assist me with any questions that I had."
good,Convergys was a great organisation and anybody who is open yo learninng should work there atleast once. you just need to be watching and observing and slowly you adapt
good,"A typical day at Convergys, I spend my day answering consumers' questions, resolving their complaints, taking their orders and signing them up for new services. I'm the public ""face"" of my company although, more often than not, interaction is via phone, email or live chat, rather than actually in person."
good,I don't have any complaints. My wife was going through medical problems that forced me to quit. The pay was decent. The work environment was relaxed but maintained professionalism.
good,"A typical day involved getting to my computer cubicle and receiving customer service phone calls. Problem solving, data entry, and calling other facilities were a daily routine. Co-workers were kind, although not a lot of interaction since the position requires a constant headset and phone call."
good,"Convergys is a really good job. I worked for two of the four projects that they had there, and I loved both. Compared to other call centers that I've worked for, Convergys has to be the best one. Their training is very in-depth, and they really want to ensure that you strive at their company. During training you make some really good friends, and the trainers are usually very nice. Management is great!  The only reason I stopped working there is because I was sick of call centers in general."

good,"On a average you would get about 50 calls a day.Each day you learned something new with a customer about AT&T. My co- workers was very friendly people from all over the world, from the Bahamas to Cuba. The hardest part of the job is not being able to give the customer what they wanted, due to company policy. The main part I enjoyed about my job is being able to interact with our clients to give them the best customer service experience possible."
good,"At convergys i had a great time working there. The day starts off with a few calls back to back and a break here and there. Then lunch and talk to coworkers and then take some more calls, after that we go home after our shift."

good,Talked on the phone most of the day and gave prices of products.

good,Loved working here. Working with such great people who were really fun to be around.
good,"nice company, nice work life balance , Basic salary is less but you can earn with overtime... nothing compares Convergys..."
good,"I learned to maximize my abilities more because I had different departments handled from my two previous job. One was easier and the other was really, very challenging. I can tell because even the job that the system does from my first job, it is us who do it on my latter job. The trainers were very good and I learned a lot from them. They also did their best to be friendly towards us without losing professionalism. The workplaces were both great because there are a lot of amenities and also the benefits and salaries were good. The most enjoyable part of my jobs before were the times when the management never forgets to at least put a little enjoyment on our everyday work. They offer new bonuses, there were raffles and prizes especially during occasions. And also freebies, I enjoyed the most too."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the people and management that work there. Very family-like environment.
good,Working for Convergys was a great opportunity for me. I loved that I got to work from home using my own office and equipment. Management was very helpful when there were issues and weekly meetings were very insightful to how I was performing. This is one of the companies I would definitely go back to. unfortunately my internet connection was not stable enough and I would get points taken from attendance when I would have an outage.
good,"Nice company to work for , plenty of advancement within company. Excellent pay."
good,"Good place to work and learn"
good,Worked fro multiple accounts at my time there. The environment was friendly.
good,"When I get to work I log on to my computer, check emails to see if there were any updates on products or sales, next I take phone calls until I take my break and the same throughout the day. I learned how to help customers solve their problems and when I could not help my manager would step in and help out. Management was a big help always there when you need them. My co-workers was friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was to get off the phone under a minute. When a person reached their destination with no problems."
good,"Call center for direct tv, inbound , answered over 70 calls a day, entered data in to computer. Very fast paced, great company and people. Enjoyed time working there."
good,Overall this was a pretty good job in my opinion. I was is an outbound calling position for ebay. In my opinion my job would have been more enjoyable if I had been in inbound calling. I think that the pay was great though for my first job.
good,the only problem i had was as a trainee you not really supported very well.
good,"A typical day includes me logging into the portal & managing a team of 20 agents.  I keep track of their sales, weekly statistics,evaluate their calls & manage time cards. Ive learned all people are diffwerent & have different learnig techniques. The hardest partof the job is having to terminate someones employment.  The best partof my hjob is the people I get to work with on a daily basis from all over the United States."
good,Its really good to work with a time by putting maximum individual effort  to achieve the target
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes!

good,"very nice.friendly people crowded on some days"
good,"I would start my day waiting and making sure that I would punch time-in in the exact minute. Then I would get my tools ready (my spiels, troubleshooting strategy organizer, etc.) to take customers complaints, worries, online payments, product inquiries, add-on, orders, and account cancellation be resolved and provided to them to ensure excellent customer service satisfaction. "

good,Great working place and Managers are really nice not great job security though but benefits and pay is outstanding
good,work as easy and laid back. Co workers were very friendly. the hardest part of the job was making sure every customer problems became resolved within a time limit. the most enjoyable pat  of the job is having people there who was there to help you when you couldnt solve the issue yourself
good,A typical day at work passed by very quickly since taking customer service calls back to back keeps your mind entertained with people's stories. Mainly i learned how a big company operates their policies and computer systems. My co-workers were very enjoyable to be around as well as they were always willing to help with questions as we looked out for our group performance. The hardest part of the day was to finish my entire lunch on a half hour and the most enjoyable was to solve people's issues.
good,A typical day consisted of coming into the job site and filling out some information about the previous days labor. Then we would start accepting phone calls from At&t customers. Would resolve customers issues and attempt to make a sale. Sometimes mangers would pull you off the phones to go over your stats and offer compliments and/or constructive criticism. Management also spent time reviewing sales techniques and ways to enhance the likelihood of making a sale. Co-workers were all professional. The hardest part would be dealing with angry and irrational customers as well as getting stuck on a problem when no one was available to help you. The most enjoyable part was helping solve problems for people who were very courteous and appreciative. Job offered a lot of opportunities for advancement. There was adequate job training. Commission on sales.
good,"a typical day at work would be coming in and off back getting set up at your cpu. Pull your tools up and begin taking calls. My co-workers are cool because all of us at the time felt the same way about the job . Hardest part is selling over the phone. Even though all my customers loved me,buying tv service was a whole other ball game. the most enjoyable part of the day was when your customer tells you that you did a great job in fixing their problem and that they wish my job had more like me."
good,"Overall good experience at Convergys. Great people, but constant churn of employees."
good,I have a lot of challenges working in a call center but its a very interesting job to go. I like to work with customers and helping them with managing there accounts. Also solving there problems. I received seven certificates because i gave great customer service and one employee of the month
good,"The job is in fact very demanding but at the end it is very rewarding as well. I felt pride in the fact that I was working for AT&T, which hired Convergys to satisfy its customer service needs. The managers who were in charge of training me were very knowledgeable about their subject areas and that resulted in me having an increase in self confidence at the work place."

good,I love working for the company great to be able to work from home. But my pay is not enough with me having a family to care for. If it was just me with not so many bills great. But the management and employees are great.
good,"It's a call center so you have the relaxation of not having the customer in your face and having coworkers around you to chat with if you can or ask questions if you need, but customers have no filter over the phone. They will tell you whatever they want how they want, they don't care because you'll never see them. Concentrix is currently going through a lot with certain departments so there's a lot to fix, but the managers are amazing. They always try their best to make sure their employees thrive. Great work environment, would've loved it, but had to move away. 8/10 would work again."
good,The benefits is the your social and typing skills can be sharpen its a fun but professional environment. The management are all wonderful people but the hardest part of the job is the communication since my school schedule was change four different time; however the most enjoyable part is the people you interact with.

good,I really enjoyed my time at Convergys.The only downfall I ever experienced were the freezes on pay increases for salaried employees. The ability to advance within the company and to travel are out there if you have a strong work ethic. Each location has a different client and with each client comes a perk such as free directv or discounts on your at&t bill.

Though it was just a month I have learned a lot of things from here. each day is actually full of excitement and learning such as learning how to deal with irate customer, what appropriate tone and words should be used, how to document the call."
good,"I have learned managerial skills. I have fantastic co-workers that help out when needed. On a daily basis, I will prepare a lecture or lesson for a training class of approximately 20-24 people. Our main goal as an Associate Trainer is to facilitate any material given by our clients to our agents so they are able to perform on a production level. My boss is an amazing person that helps out when i require him to be there. He is a person that i could go for leadership and i consider him my mentor. I don't find anything difficult about my employment. I enjoy what i do and give my best efforts in my current employment to help my company succeed. The most enjoyable part of my job is when i'm gathered up with my co-workers because we have a strong professional relationship as a team and it's easy to get along with them."
good,I loved working there the pay was great the environment was very laid back and was super easy the management was great and you always had your team  members and team leader to help through it all.
good,The experience was great. I moved up in the company fairly fast. Customer service for the USPS was my job. I moved up from a domestic agent to a international representative. From there I became a supervisor and then to express mail research. Even though it was high stress I enjoyed the job experience.
good,"I enjoyed working for Convergys. I started out as a customer service rep for Directv and ended up working data entry (which was better pay, better hours and better shift). I would have worked my way up to manager if it hadn't been for the fact that I had to resign. There were complications during my first pregnancy and my husband at the time wanted me to be home full time. I wish they still had a call center in Oklahoma. I believe they are strictly work from home now."
good,it was an awesome job and i regret leaving it for moving but i had to and they were all really nice and everyone got along and was polite it was fantastic and just an overall good experience!
good,"Working with convergys was VERY exciting. I am A mother first and I told the company this as well. I first stated off at A mid day shift., Once i worked with them, they work with you and they changed my schedule. They will work with your home life and they are A VERY understanding company. I dislike that departments close and open when they would please and that is how I lost my job. My department closed down with only a few weeks warning."
good,"Training would consist of learning the tips and tricks of how to use the programs on the computer. These programs were high quality and needed throughout the job, especially while on the phone. My co-workers were fun and outgoing, which lightened the mood of the work environment. Training lasts up to 5 weeks, and consists of switching ""classes"" and groups."
good,"I take calls for 4 hours with a 15 min break before I get off my first shift. i get 4-5 hours off before going back for my second shift  where I work another 4 hours with a 15 min break."
good,"I enjoy working for Minacs. I love my co-workers and I learned a lot on how to sell to customers while finding solutions to their call to satisfy them the best way possible while working for Bell Aliant. The hours are very flexible and consistant, also the benefits are great. The hardest part of the job is dealing with upset customers!"
good,Processing Tax reurns for client. Providing customer service for internal clients as well as external. Train and manage 30-60 employees at one time.
good,I was a Customer Service Representative in Aditya Birla Minacs. learned lots of things while working in this company.the overall management staff and coworkers co-operated with nicely to enhance the performance regarding to company.
good,"On a typical workday, I would ensure my customers issues were resolved by creating a resolution that adhered to their specific wants and needs. I learned that it is highly important to build rapport with your customers so they will remain enthusiastic about their cell phone provider. Management was very encouraging and genuinely polite. Co-workers were willing to help when needed and very friendly. What made my work so enjoyable was knowing that by the end of the call, my customers were happy and had a better attitude about their cell phone provider."
good,"What a typical day at work would be, Clock in at 8:45am and be om the phones til my break which would be around 11:45am and then go back on the phones and work until my lunch which would be around 1:15pm and then go to a Pre-shift meeting at 1:45pm with the team lead and then get back to work and be on the phones around 2:30pm and then after that wait til my last break around 3:30pm and work all the way til 5:15pm and that would be my everyday routine. "
good,"cricket tournament, dancing, singing  compaction,  etc"
good,"I love my job right now since we handle chat through communicating our customers, I like the management because they are transparent with their agents like win win situation. Though the metrics is difficult and keeps on changing every month but if you are focus and dedicated, it's passable."
good,Convergys does alot of postive fun things for its employees.
good,Great job and nice people . Good work environment. Too many calls coming in though.
good,Worked in call center answering phone for Sprint customers. I addressed the concerns of the customer and resolved their issues with the bills or phones.
good,"I learned a lot about billing, adjustments, sales, and most of all great customer service. The job was enjoyable and it was a great place to work, great people. The hardest part about the job is bidding for our hours, i don't mind working long hours but i like to have a set schedule, but over all a great place to work."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes!

good,"Convergy's is a nice place to work and has great benefits. It's a calm, professional job."
good,"A regular day at Convergys, was a very exciting place to work! Very professional management were always available to assist us with any and all questions concerning our duties. Very friendly co-workers made the day go by a lot easier as well! The hardest part of the job was having to leave because I was only temporary. I had already worked at previous call centers but this particular job helped me learn the importance of the steps taking to process customer packages and needs when it came to fulfilling there requests. The most enjoyable part of the job honestly was the people and the work environment that made the job unlike any other place I've ever been a part of!"
good,"Company is awesome. Specially the facilities. Omg.. The Google feeling, the food, the ambience, the cab facilities each and everything was fun great including work. But the work life balance would be hectic as they do some frequent team shuffling for which employees face problems to adjust for different shifts."
good,"I enjoyed everyone I work with, all my team leaders have been amazing.  They always had incentives to help us achieve our goal.  Great monthly bonus when we met our goals.."
good,"I miss convergys id work there again anytime, pay was great, I had weekends off and I liked my managers an co-workers. nice building it was newly built ."
good,"I worked a fast paced project. We answered calls, qualified members, assisted with account maintenance and resolutions via phone and email. I enjoyed the relaxed yet professional environment.  One of my favorite places to work!"
good,"I enjoy working with customers and helping them fix their companies payroll issues. I learned patience and empathy working under quickbooks. Management is very helpful with educating their agents, and there's a lot of mixed culture and great people. The hardest part of my job is when a customer has a problem that isn't fixable. The most enjoyable part is after hearing someone calling with the sound of defeat in their voice but hang up with the sound of happiness gives me a sense of accomplishment."
good,Had one major contract with ATT&T. Both  companies was very good with promotions and raises as well as commissions. Offered full medical and dental benefits.
good,"Convergys is closing down it’s doors in January. It was my favorite place to work. I loved my job, and the people were basically a family to me. I wish they didn’t need to close down."
good,"Everything was ok in the company except that its my choice to leave for better opportunities abroad."
good,I love convergys off Claude freeman. I was working here for three years and loved every part of my job. The management and HR was like family. Training was well put together and if you needed more assistance it was available.
good,They give nice benefits. They are pro employee. They won't let you go unless it is necessary or needed to. They find a way to help you get to a new account if ever the account you are in got dissolved.
good,"Jobs pretty basic, but overall stressful dealing with rude customers, plus 15 minute breaks feel like 5 especially when you have to walk to the other side of the building"
good,"it was a easy job quick to catch on , helping others with there cable phone and internet. work places very organizes and peaceful. The job was seasonal"
good,Good company. Flexible timings. But not much of employee welfare programs... Company is good for fresher's. The salary is not up to the expectations..
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."

good,"Great place to work and learn for students and folks who are right out of college. Lots of training, fast paced environment."
good,typical day you're assisting customer with routes and or informing the customers of our services the bad part about it is when you have to go home the best part is just coming in knowing you've changed or saved a life by doing your job the management is great as well as advancement its easy to move up if you do your job
good,"Habe mein Englisch und Deutsch verbessert, viele Freunde gemacht und einfach nette kollegen"
good,it gets hurt once you don't have sales but I enjoy working there
good,"very good company"
good,"Convergys is a great employer for some, but for me it just was not the right fit. Call centers are made for a certain group of people who are able to handle irate and upset customers, along with handling their own nerves. If your able to handle call center jobs I would definitely recommend checking out Convergys."
good,I was given precise knowledge of network infrastructure and worked on big projects regarding implementing network and communication solutions.
good,"The hardest part about this job is sales, you have to convince your customers to buy the product over the phone.  While you have resolved there issue for calling you have to transition to sell the products."
good,"	Answered Phones"
good,Clocked in went to a cubicle and signed into all the programs we used daily. I leared how to roll modems and send signals. There were too many co-workers to know them all but from the ones I knew always made the work enviorment a great place. The hardest part was getting the customer to calm down so that you could resolve the problem. Best part was the pay and benifits!
good,Great place to grow if you are ready to put in quality and hard work.
good,After the long 7 weeks of training the job was actually alright.
good,Enjoyed the job. However the company closed down in Kamloops.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Great company to work for. Compensation and benefit package competative with all major customer service comapnies
good,"Fast paced enviroment with high volume calls, Friendly coworkers"
good,Convergys Corporation is a great company to work for with many growth opportunities.
good,"The work culture was upbeat, the company was great and  the pay was very good. We learned hoe to color hair and fix mistakes, the customer service for the customer was on point."
good,"Assist customers with their problems."
good,They wanted sales more then they wanted happy customers. They only cares about the sales. None of the management has people skills.
good,I Did Enjoy There Quietness After Being There From The Time Ive Spent On The Phones but There Work Was Very Easy And I wanted Something With A bit Of A Challenge
good,Minacs is completely a mallu and bangali management now recruitment is going on from only low paying candidates and for out station candidates secondly the work is pathetic work environment is very very bad intensives are eaten by management no job security they will lay you off putting improper blam on you they will treat you like criminals so beware of this company and its management really i curse this company
good,very few calls. unscripted. co-workers were great. Amex people were great to work with. Great boss.
good,You have to have a great attitude to work here. You will come across some hard to please customers as well as the mang. team. They do have basic stats that you must achieve. I have been there over a year and like it just need to make more per hour to survive. They are the type of place that you can work a 40 hr week and still need some type of assistance to survive.
good,"minacs is the good platform for the freshers"
good,They overwork their employees with little.or no compensation i was not surprised they outsourced to.india since it.costs less with less human rights there.
good,The job was very fun. I worked on the Chrysler project. The only downside was the management. They did not act professional and were very disorganized. They loaded every employee with way too much work for us to accomplish and then punished us for not completing it. Horrible Company!
good,Very inclusive and diversified. A relaxed environment. Co workers are very pleasant and easy to work around. Majority of my co workers are my peers which is preferred.
good,"Ambiente estresante, falta de compromiso por parte de los jefes..."
good,"I will be starting my third year at Convergys with perfect attendance and yet I still have not been seen as one of the front runners for moving up within the company. There is a lot of outside hiring without looking within the site. I have had the pleasure of moving up to Assistant Manager but that is as far as it seems like I will get. There is no room for improvement, one slip up and you may be out."
good,"A typical day at work, is first walking into a fun work place, there was lots of opportunities to make more money. It was filled with help and support everywhere you looked. They offered a great break room, and there was free food offered every once in awhile, during promotional deals and so forth. It overall was a great place to work."
good,working for converged was a very eye opening experience. yes you get to sit down and just take calls. but helping people find there packages and creating cases and making all the right calls just to make the customer happy.
good,"A little too relaxed workplace, rules and regulations  not consistently enforced. Dress code was not enforced at all people would wear whatever to work."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,You barely had time to eat your food. As an advisor you're supposed to get a 30 minute lunch break but that time quickly runs out. If you go to the restroom for a restroom break it would cause issues with the new attendance policy that they have. If you are sick you don't get any paid sick days. The raise was well.
good,"Los horarios se pueden acomodar a convenir, no es mal pago"
good,"pays good, hours are great but they dont accomodate anything. management is poorly educated. coworkers can be obnoxious."
good,"must improve management with respecting employees company can be good to work for, have a lot to work on with coaching and developing people"
good,"Big company, lot of layoffs and changes.  Good learning environment with PM standards."
good,Why you need review?for what purposes?i just dont understand why i need to fill this up..all i want is a new job..is that hard to check here?all i want is nee job
good,management is good. Team leaders are very helpful and friendly they are very understanding when it comes to family issues. Would have stayed longer but the minimum wage they offer can be a challenge for a family person with responsibilities.
good,Convergys is one of the company that has hunters and frontliners. It is good idea to have this kind of employee who work outside and fund some aspiring call centers who want to join BPO.
good,"As a fresher I learnt a lot. "
good,Nice place to work if the management is good. Fun and cool work place. Great place to learn more attend more training module. Annual games functions etc.
good,"I went on a 5 working days every week. had to take in calls for 6.5hours a day."
good,An okay place to work. Some of the helpers were rude and did not show any effort to care. Once you get the hang of things it is easier.
good,Unfortuantely wages are capped at Minacs or I wouldn't be looking for another job. The hardest part of the job is never having weekends off.
good,"A typical day would be very busy with ton of work, for sure  you will come out with something new learnt with technical caliber ."
good,"Taking high volume of calls such as 300 or more per day. To  make a easy job into a difficult job, was frustrating."
good,Company forced to all employees for movement other 5 states no body can't say which state to send. So most of the employees resigned from the job due to company not able to choose of Locations in fever of employee.
good,"Pay for supervisor was only $12.00, which was not that great. It should have paid more with responsibility of assisting 40 plus agents with Amazon.com."
good,"management was not professional, pay was much less than other centers, offered bereavement leave with pay, some schedule flexibility, Offere PTO after a requires amount of hours had been accumulated."
good,"Love the account, unstressful and fun. You can definitely enhance customer service skills and learn a lot. Friendly TL's and SME's. Management make sure fun workplace for their agents."
good,"Full of nice employees"
good,Working for Onstar was one of my favorite jobs i was able to make a huge difference in a lot of people's day and i got a lot of people out of unsafe and/or scary situations and i was proud to do so.
good,A Typical Day Of Work Was Taking Calls Helping My Costumers With There Issues Such As There Phone Not Working Having To Trouble Shoot It.. Id Also Help Read There Bill For Them To Help Them Better UnderStand There Plan And Mins Sometimes Even Sale Them A 2nd Line On There Accounts For Sprint. I Loved This Job.
good,"was great to be with Aditya Birla Group, enjoyed learned had good experience about the nature of works."
good,"I left this position because I was promised a promotion to a higher level technical support and when it came time to actually start that position I was just moved to another department with no answers as to why I didn't receive what I was promised. I was reaching the goals and customer satisfaction to maintain that position. When I was moved to the other department i should have received a pay increase and I never did. Also, I fought with this company for 2 months about receiving insurance and when I left they still hadn't done anything about it"
good,"the stations are good and my team leader really attentive to our concerns if ever me an my teammates are having problems with some of the tools. Very strict in the attendance, dress code and scorecard. Changing of score metrics and many benefits and activities to encourage employees to work well."
good,"It was a nice place to work, only thing is management wasn't employee friendly"
good,"First my first year and half at convergys it was awesome, then the client AT&T decided to put in  AT&T Dsl and uverse sales into our call center.They are very pushing with sales, make you offer sales on no mater the type of call even if call is about wireless customer is looking to remove stuff to same money, oh lets offer them new DSL or Uverse services  make their bill even higher hahah AT&T  is a joke to work for."
good,"taking in-bound calls from at&t cutomers who might have had a problem with there bill,cell phone or there service. MAde payment arrangements for customers and also took payments."
good,I would love to go back the job was very welcoming easy to learn and plenty of access to tools and programs that you would to perform your job properly wish I could have worked from home with this company
good,assisted 50-100 customer per day from incoming calls. Resolved and answered questions and concerns fro customers. Documented and followed up on complaints. Answered questions and provide information on variety of service.
good,"call center"
good,"Very good company to work with"
good,"The management, environment security, ambience, people working with, and the department heads are all great. It's just that the account which I applied for is too difficult for me."
good,Awesome place to work the hours and shifts are all over the morning afternoon and overnight I worked in customer service and sales great pay it’s not bad
good,"We were being investigated for constant fraud the break room sold questionable food. There is security at the door and the parking lot is patrolled so nobody ever gets their cars damaged or broken into,"
good,"I did my internship here way back 2016. I know I've lacked recruitment skills back then, but this company helped me gain those skills even in a span of 3 months, I've learned a lot."
good,Convergys had multiple giveaways and contest. I did make a lot of commission off of sales. I met a lot of fun people here at Convergys. Company is shutting down December 22 2017.
good,"Good work environment with nice colleagues, Relaxing but very crucial time limitations, hygenic environment to work in. This company tought me time management."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Open work environment, "
good,"Normal call center.  I'm not sure they exist anymore. They tried to make work fun with contests and also had gifts from HBO, SHOWTIME and other companies."
good,"Work here if want a job where you sit on your butt and get nothing done! Management here just move up so they won't have to do anything. Once you became a ""red"" hat you were required to train and work with your team. I was on a team with this one manager I kid you not I could stand there with my hand up for help screaming at her and no response! Again management that does not care about the good of the company!"
good,"Productive and fun workplace                                                "
good,A day at Convergys is very busy. Constant calls and live chat assistant. They do reward employees depending on the holiday and who your team leader is. This can be an exciting place to work for someone who enjoys call centers.
good,"The work queue is more than manageable. The good thing is that no matter how many calls you get, rest-assured you would know what to do and how to handle it. everything we needed to know was provided and explained during the training. the management is satisfactory. some are okay, some are horrible bosses and some are excellent. the work place is always clean and their facilities are great, you wouldn't even mind staying a few hours after work just to rest back and relax at the lounge. The hardest part? That would be being required to handle four different queues at a time. we were highly trained to be flexible and therefore, we are required to take in calls for different kinds of products. putting that aside, I was able to find a second home at work and that was what made me stay for a year and eight months."
good,"taking rapid inbound calls, assisting customers with credit card processing, billing inquiries, and payments.  Probing to find  the wants, interests, and needs of customers, to assist in locking in sales, and up-selling whenever possible."
good,"Overall 2+ years of experience in Telecom BPO (Inbound) industry to develop & enhance my skills, being a keen learner, it helped me to understand the work flow & execute end to end resolution. Starting my career from a grass root level & working in different roles benefited me in knowing the business form other dimension."
good,Fun place to work with many perks and bonuses.  Lot of professional training available to ensure the job is perfected.  They recognize their employees who do a good job.
good,this was the first company that I worked for to have a ping pong table or any other activities. I learned a lot about apple products and a new way to approach troubleshooting. The hardest/best part about this job  is working with all the different costumers and helping them solve their issues. co-workers were OK but really young minded. The management was lacking on new information. The costumers knew about products and issues before we did.
good,"Receive trouble shooting calls from customer regarding their cable, internet or phone services. Once resolved try to cross sell new products or upgrades"
good,"convergys was a good place to work for, i love it when i was working there but it just seemed like it was high school all over again."
good,"Great people to work with,customers are fantastic. Management being based in United States however, takes away any and all job security. A recession proof business which has laid-off 50% of the centre due to call volume decrease. I would NOT recommend this job to anyone even if it was the best places that I've been thusfar"
good,Days here were easy going. Busy call center for the most part. Once one call hangs up another one calls in within 5 minutes on a slow day and within 5 seconds on a fast day.
good,"Started as a TSO became certified SME, as a start up this organization is a good to work with, It enhances your basic corporate skills and make you ready to take on the world"
good,"Management suck,  team leaders are no help,  opportunity growth is their but no on wants to help you.  The building is infested with bed bugs. It's always hot and congested."
good,"Even though l only worked for Convergys for a short period of time, l really had fun working there. I met some great people who helped me become comfortable at work"
good,"Convergys is a great company, but it is what it is: A Call Center. As such, it's got limited movement and advancement opportunities, and while the salarys paid are competitive, they are salarys for the kind of work you would do at a call center. I would absolutely recommend Convergys as a place to work for anyone just starting out in the job world, in need of a temporary job, or someone who just prefers the call center life (and all it's associated benefits and drawbacks)."
good,"It was good to work but salary is less . No pressure in concentrix"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"customer services"
good,"The company develops its employees very well and it promotes great customer service at all levels. Also, great environment to perform employee's best job."
good,Like any place that you work it has its pros and cons. We dont agree with a lot of the things that the management does but again that's on any job. You have to check them out for yourself
good,Got chance to improve myself as a responsible person..it was fun while work in convergys..the team members were helpful ...also leant punctuality there.
good,The company is a good company to work for if one is interested in working from home. Training is extensive and there is always someone available to whom to ask questions
good,"Working environment good, lackingly closed the department of services for directv, should maintain people with productive capacity, salary improvements,"
good,"It's fun when it's avail time.... I've learned how to be patient, to work under pressure and to deal with unique personalities of other people. My Co-workers are also one the reasons working on a graveyard shift is not a hassle. The hardest part of the job is to agree with your body clock and have to deal the with the time. Most enjoyable part would be the freebies given by the company."
good,"Highly experienced Customer Service professional. Able to handle a high volume of customer calls in a fastpaced"
good,"Rotational shifts after every 3 months. Body clock is never stable."
good,high turn over rate but so far it been good. I had no problems with the training it was  very easy and understandable.
good,I enjoyed working there. It was a seasonal position but the hours were good and the pay was good.
good,Having to talk to people with no clue was about anything computer related was one of the worst work environments one could ask for. day in a day out of frustration did not last to long.
good,assisting customer with transferring money from one account to another. Also helping them get into online account after being locked out assiting with changing passwords
good,"I usually get on the phone to help customers with there problems"
good,"great job, good benefits, data entry,bundled bills, weekend off"
good,"great place with awesome benefits pay, benefits, bonus, gifts, pto, uto, sick leave, referral bonus$500 you will take around 60-70 calls per shift once you get it its super easy"
good,"Fantastic Corporation to work for, great and interesting people, the learning material was great, the hardest part of the job was having to disconnect a customer for non payment"
good,Management lacks empathy. Asked to take an exam or more every week. The co-workers are rude and unfriendly. I enjoyed the building and the customers.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Working at Convergy's was fun. Being able to assist customers everyday felt good. This job had its ups and downs but I kept focused on what the most important task was and that was to assist/serve.

good,The typical work day involved signing in and making myself available for calls to come in. During each call I had to enter the data that the customer gave me as well as what we were talking about. While entering data I also had to make sales and keep a record of what was sold. My coworkers were very helpful as well as the management. The most enjoyable part of my day was helping customers with their concerns and knowing that they were pleased with the service they received from me. The hardest part of the job was the test at the end because we had to take a live call without the help of the trainer. What made that part so difficult was just getting over the anxiety of doing it alone.
good,Overall this job is a fun place to work at. You learn something new everyday about the customer's and their vehicles. There's alot of friendly employees to work with and they're all about team work. The hardest part about this job is that you cant always meet the customer's needs and they get very upset if they're not satisfied with the resolution you provide them.

good,this is a great company to work for if you are looking for an at home position. Full time and great benefits. Flexible schedule and paid time off.
good,"Convergys provides a safe feeling environment, with a very comfortable atmosphere. In a general day the call volume is enough to keep us busy and focused. We are often provided entertainment to reward our hard work and that is much needed and appreciated. Convergys is a good starting point for anyone looking to begin but the structure does become a bite over whelming and that's what leads to such a high turn over rate and that's the hardest part of the job. I am able to adapt to change so the job came easy for me."

good,"A typical day (or night) at work starts off with a light of my cigarette and a cup of coffee, getting ready to go to the battlefield. The work cant be compared to a regular office work, its a job that will require everything you've learned from elementary to present, its a continuous learning experience, your the middleman, some report to you, you report to your boss and the transition should be as smooth as possible. People inside the office cant be considered as friends, but rather, as family. At the end of the day, its not about who finished first or last, but how all of you worked together as a team, as a family. Its good to know you have your colleagues back, and they got yours. Then, I end my day at work with another light of my cigarette, knowing that tomorrows going to be another fight."

My co-workers accept me where I came from and taught me some techniques in handing customers needs. The  most enjoyable part of my job is that when we have a group meeting on how to increase our individual scores in order to pass and satisfy our client. By that we gathered informations  through each of us having different thoughts.
good,"I was in a graveyard shift with odd schedule but the work environment is so much fun. Start of shift to huddle all team leaders to set proper expectations of staffing, stats, and other deliverable. One of the hardest part of my job is when absenteeism goes up on a weekend. Its criticality is visible to the client and staffed agents would need to render overtime to achieve staffing requirement. And the most enjoyable is when stats look good and RNR (rewards and recognition) is happening."
good,"A typical day at work is basically answering inquiries from different healthcare providers in the United States regarding Anthem's insurance information.

good,"This was one of the best jobs i've had since i started working . My days there would mostly consist of walking the call centers' floors helping and influencing others with positive motivation and accuracy. Taking inbound customers' service calls was another part of the job that i enjoyed. It taught me how to have a great deal of patience, and to always strive to be better than the day before. My past co-workers were very friendly and easy to get along with. They were always willing to lend a helping hand when needed and really understood the meaning of teamwork. Our management staff always motivated us to go one step ahead of the game and i loved that. The hardest part of the job i'd say was coaching an agent to self discovery. Meaning, helping the agent understand what he/she did wrong on a call by asking probing questions to come to an understanding of what needs to be corrected. The most enjoyable part of the job would be how much we were praised for our outstanding efforts."

It then went to Tier 3, and warranty. Management was really good to work with and for. I had a couple co-workers that I communicated with. Not very often. More in passing. The hardest part of the job is when I am helping a customer and they want me to change the price of a product and had to advise them that is out of my control, but did provide them with the corporate number that they could call. My most enjoyable part is when a customer would want to speak with my supervisor and give me a good compliment on my professionalism."

good,Convergys is one of the best company in the Philippines. Everybody knows that it is one of the top BPO company that has the best representativenot just here in the Philippines but in the world. But I think they should think and formulate a plan to make it easier for their employee to reach their goals and pass their stats. This is not just for their employee's benefits but for their end too.

good,A typical work day at Convergy's would be clocking in and getting straight on the phones. Its not as stressful early in the morning but around mid-day it picks up with heavy call volume with customers upset about their bill and wanting the problem solved.

I get to be with differe nt types of personality of people and their culture. The toughest part of the job was to handle a call from an irrate costumer but my technique for that was let them vent out their frustrations, listen to them and by the time they're okay to listen to you, I would make them feel they are being understood which they are. Get to hte bottom part of the problem, analyze and give best resolution. The most enjoyable part of my job was satisfying my costumers and ending the call great."

good,They do not work with you with family issues. I had to quit because they would not give me a set schedule during the day when my daughter could go in day care. Was promised pay raises that I did not get. Team leaders did not know any more about taking phone calls than you did. Training did not prepare you for the phone calls you would get.
good,"I enjoy working in the field of customer service, because it allows me to be able to assist others. Although routinely the same system(s) or program's were used each day, a typical work day at Convergys, for me, was never routine, yet always a new experience because working in a call center that was based on inbound calls, each call was different  from the: type of assistance needed,solution(s) or option's offered in resolving and or satisfy the customer the customer needs. I have always enjoyed being able to work with others, such as, co-workers as well as working along with my customer, either over the phone or face to face. Customer service Representative, was the position that I was hired threw as when I began my employment with Convergys. After being advanced to different tier's of level of support, I began to manage my own team, where I was then promoted to the position of being a Team Leader.

Being in a position that I was able to not only assist customers, but also employees, in ways that they would allow them to be able to better themselves, feel motivated, capable of being able to achieve performance levels and personal work goals, improve in work ethnics from the employers and or clients views but as well as in overall customer satisfaction. Working with Convergys, was an enjoyable and rewarding experience for me, in managing my own team and as being a member of management, even when at times I was faced with duties that were not hard, yet challenging"

good,It was OK you may get a team leader that doesn't show concern but then you get the team leaders that never get off your back. Good pay not so good coworkers.

I learned a lot about the different credit cards that each of the major carriers had, this included what benefits were available for each card. Management staff always done a good job of ensuring that they praised and rewarded the employee's that were working each day. You would see management encourageing the staff that were struggling with thier quotas.  The work place was very friendly and would volunteer to help you if you were not sure about understanding how to explain something to a client. The hardest part of the job was training.  There, were so many credit cards and features for each. The most enjoyable part of the job was the praise and help from everyone."

good,"All in all Concentrix Lynchburg is a great place to work, the pay is way above standard for call centers in the area with regards to the agents. Plus the schedules are likely also the best you will find for any call center in the area. There is also a lot of job security here, the clients are very stable and you don't have to deal with a lot of the standard call center woes like clients leaving and you struggling to find a new spot on a different program. The schedules are exceptionally stable for the call center world, i have been here since June 2018 and my teams schedule has not permanently changed even once. By contrast at other call centers i had worked at in the past i would probably be on my 4-6 permanent schedule by now. "
good,"I definitely enjoyed working here, sometimes it's repetitive but that's the type of work it is, but at least you always know what you're doing. I, personally didn't like my manager, she definitely had favorites and I know you'll encounter that wherever you go but here, it was ridiculous."

Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Good but not much room for advancing in company.  Guidelines for call durations constantly change and not always updated when change occurs.
good,This company is a customer oriented company and sometimes they forgot to understand the agents sentiments. At least the place is fun to work with because of my co workers.
good,Loved high call volumes. Loved talking to customers and assisting in help. I like the fact that i had to use more than one source to complete and solve an issue. There was always open communication in he work place . over all a nice and warm environment.

good,"i took calls and handled troubleshooting equipment, commenting account, setting up service calls, billing inquiries, giving credits, changing subscriptions ordering equipment either replacement or upgrading i learned how to troubleshoot satelite equipment, management was ok, but they switch team leaders all the time i had probably 8 different tls in 2 years. the hardest part of the job is putting up with mad customers and getting used to the different days off. the most enjoyable part of the job is getting satelite for free. coworkers were great very supportive. you can advance, but they didd't offer incentive to advance if you become a manager they give you a salary instead of hourly pay which is good if you get your work done on time but if you have to work  overtime it sucks there must be other benefits but they didn't tell us what they were applying for the case management team gives you set days off and i think there was a raise. not sure what it is"
good,The OM seems to really care about the needs of the employees. It is a fun work environmnt. My co workers are pleasant.. The hardest part of the job is I feel like I am harrassing the customers sometimes. I enoy mu day when the customers cooperate
good,"Loved working there just hated how there human resource department is located in India."
good,"I st day of On Job Training was a good experience"
good,"Good management and co-workers. Besides getting some very rude customers, on the most part if you just listen to them, that is what they want."
good,"Great employee rewards. Onsite banking, stock, medical, dental"
good,"At Convergys call center, I learned to work under extreme pressure having to answer calls in high call volume, resolve all issues for customer ranging from tech to billing or upgrades. I am very grate full for the lessons learned at that company."
good,"Managers noticed people that took care of the company/customers. I was developed in a lot of areas where I was weak to make strong. How to handle difficult conversations, time management and critical thinking were some of things I worked on. I really loved/love working for the company because of my peers and leaders that I get to work with."
good,With these jobs i was constantly working by statying busy.  thses companies will be in busiiness ini the years to come
good,workplace was good . due to contracts with vendors job security wasn't always happening
good,"I receive calls from different customer asking help for their monthly phone bill. I learned how to deal with different kinds of people with different kinds of personalities. I enjoyed helping them in their everyday issues and resolve financial management problems. The company was able to help me to improve my skills on how to understand and assist customers, make them a happy and satisfied customer  after each call. Hardest thing in this kind of job is when i have to explain and provide bad news for the customer, specially when i have to tell them what are the consequences for not paying the bills. The most enjoyable part of the job is when we are having a conference and seminars for new ideas on how to help each customer."
good,"Loved the job helping people, with a small call center environment"

good,Good organisation with an excellent track record in delivery.
good,The phone calls are normally back to back with barely time to reqroup in between calls. I've learned that most customers with complaints or problems just want to be heard. There is an excellent relation with management which makes it easy to get along with my co-workers. The hardest part of my job is not being able to resolve every problem or satisfy every customer.  What I enjoy most about my job is the feeling I get when I am able to help a customer.
good,A day at would be getting to your desk with co-workers by your side greeting you with a nice warming smile. Also to a clean work station to be comfortable in. I've learned to handle different types of situations with every customers even at worst when they are upset for issues with their services or bills. Handle multiple accounts when the call pace is call after call make sure that they are properly notated what was about in the call. Managers will check to see if the job is done through guidelines that are assigned. They will also work with the agents to get higher scores or even have the chance to make a career with the corporation. One thing that I did enjoy about the job that was easy to understand and to deal with once the understanding of the programs were dealt with.
good,"I keep busy every day with duties to include attendance (payroll), call monitoring and evaluations, coaching feedback, conference calls, client reports and supervising three different teams."
good,It was a great job I was only a temp so i did not get to experience the benefits or an advancement during my time with this company.
good,"A very good company, highly recommended. The reason for me to leave was it was a BPO and now I am not working for BPO's and it had only one client at Thane or else I would have changed the process due to which I was unhappy and unfortunately had to leave Convergys."
good,"Great company to work for overall, the hardest part of the job was sales."
good,"On a typical day at work we would have made light of sumthin, would read alot!!! However our trainer was awsome made up for the 5am wake up time with music always had somethin funny to say and respected you as a indaviduail but made you feel like you where part of a bigger/greater group. We were an odd group however we came together as a great team. Management was understanding and my coworkers became a seconde family. The best part of the day would be lunch we would all set at like one table, I know it was silly but I think we stood out because we could put our differances aside........"
good,"very nice.friendly people crowded on some days"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes!

good,"I am so proud and will always be because I was once part of this company. Convergys was my turning point for the very reason that I consider this as my foundation. Foundation in the sense that I acquired and enhanced my technical and customer service skills. For the 2 and half years that I have been with the company, I met a lot of people and I really do appreciate everybody especially my Bosses and peers, since the beginning of the training day up to my very last day. I built friendship to true people. I will always cherish those days and times I've spent inside and outside the office with colleagues. I will always refer friends who wants to jump start their career in call cente industry. Convergys will always be my first choice here in the Philippines."
good,"i worked here for 6 months and then left because of mishaps in not only my pay but the attitude of the team leaders or TL's as they call them. the calls were easy and straight forward it which wasn't the reason, its was the way they talked to you as a person rather than argue or fight leaving and looking for another job seemed like a the most logical choice"
good,While working for Convergys I recieved knowledge of how medical insurance works and what is has to offer to its customers in a call center setting . Plus procedure and protocol.
good,Calm
good,Job was very easy. Managers are plenty and very helpful. Hardest part was the hold times for other departments.
good,Typicall work day is waiting for inbound calls from clients using Cisco Products.
good,"Great place to meet people from all backgrounds, fast paced and fun if you love working with people."
good,"You are employed by Convergys but work for large companies. You learn and use the same software, computer programs that the actual company itself uses. Convergys has a great training program for its representatives and even working from home I had what seems like more assistance then I have had in face to face settings."
good,I am currently employed with the Converges Corporation. I have worked there for 7 years and I have been very successful in moving around in the company. They like to promote from within and develop their employees.
good,"We would sit at a desk all day and answer phones and set appontments for Motel 6, I learned customer service, how to work more then one line. The few co workers I remember from thats so long ago were good to work with one is still my friend. Managment I cant remember. Hardest part of Job was when we had no calls."
good,"Managed call center agents, team leaders and managers from scheduling, performance managment to career pathing.

good,Delta Bingo was one of the workplace where I had the most fun. The environment is laid back and the jobs were very relaxing and there were no rush at Delta Bingo. The management is also very easy going as well as the customers. Delta Bingo had mostly senior customers and it was so much fun to interacting with the customers.
good,I really enjoyed working for convergys. The atmosphere was very laid back. They offered lots of incentives to help keep us motivated.
good,"An excellent starting job for young professionals wishing to launch a career in any business, or for seasoned call centre careerists. The competitive (but friendly) atmosphere will foster personal growth in many areas. A rather difficult transition for people whose computer exposure has been limited for most of a 20+ year work history, and the challenge of sitting for a 9 hour shift may not be recommended for many."
good,"One of the best paying call centers if you are support staff or management. Management gets good semi annual bonuses and even agents get semi annual bonuses based on their individual metrics (most call centers leave agents out of bonus systems). Good respect between management and staff including overseas collegues. Excellent support from head office to individual call centers. Clients are generally wonderful and range from banks, to car manufacturers and have great rapport with call centers. If salaried however expect to work long hours but the pay scale does reflect this. There is however, rarely any advancement opportunity and the jobs are not very secure as these jobs are dependant upon the client staying. Overall, this is a terrific place to work and gain experience for your next new employer, I would highly recommend this company."
good,I was very happy working with Concentrix  I was there 2 1/2  years  they have a great training program and constant help when you need it  much better company than others lve worked for and would still be there if not for medical issues

good,"Nice place to work. Friendly colleagues, organized management, i learned about different cultures of work and there are many people tech you how you can overcome with obstacles"
good,Overall i didnt enjoy this job. Many times people would call irate and management hardly made an effort to comuncate with customers. Required to make a sales pitch every customer service call
good,"Productive workplace, and people are willing to assist with any problem you have."
good,"Being part of business processing outsourcing industry has instilled important values in me. The workplace is a fun and extremely competitive, that strives for excellence at all times."
good,"Honestly, don’t be scared. All you have to do is apply and try to better. If they know that you’re at least trying to become better, they’ll see to it you end up taking their job, if that’s what you want. Be the best you can be here.

good,"You would have to be really focused on your work.  There are some people that believe converges is just like high school,  it is,  but it's also what you make it and if you can focus on your job and not what's going on around you, you will be ok"

Company as a whole doesn't care much about personal life, including but not limited to kids, health,daycare, school. ect. Pay was worth the stress. Scheduling should be more considerate."
good,The company is good but the people who workthere are just messy n very unprofessional n ghetto. Some are really great people but every body elde was just unfit for this job
good,"I loved working here. It is a call center so it can get very fast paced and hectic but it also had down times where it is relaxed. The pay was good and overtime opportunities were many.

good,"The company is good, they provide a better plan for the employees , they even provide wellness program for the employees, they also have a scheduled family outing but the management or the bosses needs more improvement"
good,Convergys helped me grow into the person I am now. I really enjoyed working for this company. Many opportunities are available to each person and I took advantage of many. I loved how they had a competitive field which allowed me to accelerate. The top performers were able to pick the best work schedule. We also personalized our scripts to make it match our personalities which I loved. I was able to express who I was while engaging with the customer instead of reading an automated script. Every morning we had a meeting which was conducted by the manager to let us know how the team was doing or basic information on what was happening within the site. My managers walked us through problems we couldn't understand which made the job easy for me. Each question I had was always answered by management.

good,the sales department i was in was very cutthroat. unless you did certain things you could not change departments. they had a 16% sales rate that had to be met. if not met they would fire you on the spot. it is a very high turn over company.
good,"Converys is a great call center that offers you all of your employee benefits the day you start training. Once you have a set schedule they do not switch your days around.

good,"It was a typical contracted call center. We signed into the phones at the start of shift, took breaks at designated times, took client's calls and were graded by customer surveys. I was always one of the top performers in my area of expertise. I enjoyed the time I spent at Concentrix and wish I was still there. People sometimes make mistakes though. I cannot blame Concentrix.

good,Working for convergys has been a privilege as a fresh graduate back then. It has opened my eyes to the real world especially that it was my first job. I met all kinds of people. The management has always been very supportive and motivates us to do better. The motivation does not only come thru incentives but it comes to the appreciation of the work we do. It may have been difficult to adjust to other people's needs and set aside our emotions during tough days but we get through it with proper guidance from other tenured employees. The best thing about that is the camaraderie built within the team and most of all with the whole company during programs.

good,"That’s an interesting question. I love Mondays, mostly because the day flies by in a flash. On a given day, during the early hours you will find me speaking to the clients, finding out – proactively – what their priorities are for the week, meeting with team for half hour to communicate the clients’ needs and organizing the team schedules around the client’s priorities. I do this on Monday so that the rest of the week is well organized and we can effectively use our team’s time in exceeding client’s expectations and avoid Friday evening surprises. Rest of the week goes in delivering the product(s), updating the status with the client, answering emails and calls from our global teams. My role involves extensive management responsibilities and staying organized is not an option."

This can be proven by the attrition that the company suffered back in 2010."
good,I enjoyed working with and for Convergys a typical day would include listening and assisting with in coming calls to the call center to agents and making sure each agent models the companies image and policy. Convergys allowed me to think outside the norm and become a more critical thinker in more professional settling. The workplace itself was very diverse and I do appreciate that fully it allows you to collaborate with array of different people with different opinions. There wasn't anything hard apart being apart of something bigger than myself and the most enjoyable was assisting each and every customer and making sure they have best product or service for the needs.

good,"Love it. Targets are easy hit and you never know whats going to happen on the next call or who u will speak to. Also theres good money to be made from transfers to sales. I think your either able to work in a call centre or you arent. However the people that arent stick around and cry, or ring in sick.. and when attendance is down they need to cancel offline activities. Which isnt so nice. If people dont like their jobs..why stay there??"

I can say that the environment is really nice with a lot of friendly co-workers and team leaders. I learned in this company that punctuality is a lot more important than being skillful because you can learn things when you are punctual. The hardest part of the job is dealing with impatient members who are cursing and saying profanities but then we learned how to cope up and not to be affected so we can assist them well.

Being with the company for a year, I have learned to have more patience, understand where customers are coming from no matter what their moods are, and adjusting to their personalities. My co-workers became my 2nd family. We get along well, share insights about work, families, social, and many more. The hardest part of the job is having less time with family.

Our management makes sure that we meet our goals by applying our focus behavior and for my co-workers, they're really fun to be with. We help each other and share our best practices."

good,Good work environment.That was my fantastic job i enjoyed a lot.when i joined it. i used to made mistakes but my senior was very good and supportive they used to guide me all the time so over all that was my learning phase was very good.
good,Convergys is a brand name in BPO market . company provides the good salary package to their employee. company provides the internal education to their employee but job security is not there.
good,"Inconsistent, because contracts were determined by corporate need and was liable to terminate in short periods of time, which made job security sketchy."
good,"The best job experience, It started with the training for 1 months with meet and greet with co-workmate while learning the nature of the job with lots of games and sales development lesson. The first week of the job is more on coaching and support with the management. It makes you feel comfortable and be more motivated in pursuing sales target. Working in a call center group is awesome and perfect job need to generate sales and profit."
good,"Fun work place with supportibe management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and policies, but this expected of a big company. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside of my colleagues and learning form them."
good,"It is a great company. Everybody is kind. The working environment is good. The job is to sell phones and plans in US. I learned how to speak in English fluently. the hardest pat of the job is to convince the consumer to buy from you, provided that they cannot see you, they cannot touch the product. No matter what your mood is you need to convince them that your happy just by hearing your voice."
good,"A typical day at work is being there atleast 15 to 30 minutes before shift, preparing tools, reading updates if any. I learned to be extra patient and be humble at all times. That I need to do my work at my very best to get satisfactory results that is expected of me and by my teammates. The management and my co-workers are there to support me in ways I can't to cope up with everything. The hardest part of the job is you think you already did everything you could for the customer but still he/she isn't satisfied with your service, and hearing bad words which I really don't like. The most enjoyable part of the job is receiving excellent feedback or surveys from customers. Getting performance bonuses and incentives. And knowing you did a great job and made someone happy."
good,Working at Convergys is a great learning experience. It was not what I was expecting going into the job but the trainers worked well with my way of learning.
good,"Great first job. Great pay. However, your life at work is micromanaged. You have to meet their call time quota, you have to navigate the system the way they want you to... or your fired. Typical Call Center environment."
good,"it's a fun place to work. learned to be patient and to handle stress gracefully. the most enjoyable part is the job itself, which offers a lot of learnings."
good,This company has given me a little bit of an opportunity. The people are friendly. to move up you depends on who you know and somewhat based on job performance.
good,"Ótimo salario, remuneração possível, ambiente de trabalho amigável."
good,"Wonderful job. Whats better than working from home being able to interact with customers."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"First job thats very relaxed and not really micromanaged, very comfortable place to work. Flexible lunch hours and 15 minute breaks."
good,"I was sad I had to leave this company, but my mother was terminally ill so I had to be with her. This is a great company to work for. They have their downfalls just like anyone but overall its a great experience"
good,"This job was very fast paced , calls are back to back. Assisting Mercedes-Benz customers with any request they may have within their vehicle. Sending directions to their vehicle or looking up stores , gas stations , coffee shops. Also would assist with any billing informaion"
good,"Customer Service and support for International call center, answered an average of 100 calls a day. Learned how to better assist customer at a fast paced environment. was part of the management team, lead team to reach target goals successfully. Great co-workers, supportive and team players. hardest part of the job was working long hours each day. satisfaction that came from servicing customers and fulfilling customer's  needs above and beyond their expectation."
good,Casual environment and fun people to work with. Good place to start a career in customer service and gain experience. Management is reliable and understanding.
good,"You will able to deal most of your time with technical issue with customers computers,laptops and tablets. the most exciting part is when you able to resolved the issue that your customers encountered. Doing troubleshooting steps is also exciting specially if you able to provide solutions with your customers."
good,It is here that I developed my specially my communication skills. I am not saying my English was bad but what I am saying is I am more confident when talking to people because of the nature of the job that I do. Politics is everywhere. It also exists here. Co-workers are fun to be with. My manager is very open-minded and very friendly. He doesn't discriminate anyone. The hardest part of my job is when I don't feel like I have achieved what I wanted to achieved or if I fail to finish my daily tasks. Enjoyable part of my job is my fix day off.
good,we had ample notification of closure ...good benefits and we were all commended for the good work we produced...and rewarded in many different ways .
good,"Know lots of knowledge for basic software and also programs that are used by certain companies. Always kept the co worker in classed to learn how to get bonuses and to improve our call    numbers."
good,"The company looks out for employees. They offer gifts for performance and have entertaining games to keep the mood happy while handling calls from irate customers. Managers and supervisors are courteous and knowledgeable. Unfortunately, medical benefits are over priced and the only acknowledged merit through promotion is attendance."
good,Excellent team work and leadership. Good team communication. Hardest part of the job was getting some assistance due to being a work from home position.
good,This was a company that had no room for growth & development. There was no moving up corporate ladder. Co- worhers was inmature & annoying
good,"Concentrix is a very great place of work. I enjoy the professionalism, constant productivity, as well as being able to assist customers in a friendly matter to help resolve there issues."
good,"I had a great time were I work, they cared about me as a person as well as an employee.  I wasn't just a number to them."
good,"I found Convergys to be a company that worked hard to be fair and honest and a good place to work.  A typical day at work required you to be in place and logged on before your shift began, whether you worked at a Brick and Mortar site or Work at Home.  They paid ok but the benefits were great."
good,It was full of good people and rewarding when you helped someone. It was easy to move up and prove yourself. I loved being there and learning what I did.
good,"I enjoyed working in the company. The environment is cool. Small office located on the 9th floor of 12 story building i think. I've learned a lot from working in their company. learned to become independent and hardworking. Learned about their products and learned about different kinds of people, their personality and attitudes. Was able to overcome stress and worked while under pressure. Was able to gain a lot of friends. Management is not fine because they're not that 'pro agent'  that Co-workers are quite helpful but they have this saying that 'by the end of the day, its still a competition' sad but true. People come and go in this type of industry so you should have learned to not give your one hundred trust on them. The hardest part of the job is lacking of support. Like if you have a complicated issue or you're not allowed to process something on the customer's behalf, you have to transfer the customer to any available supervisors but the thing is, you cannot find them at all. some are on breaks, some are outside and smoking. And also another sad part is when it comes to our salary, we don't usually get our complete salary we always need to undergo some process when it comes to our disputes. We already raised this concern to the management and they're just promising us that they will do something about it but the truth is they're not. we are really having hard time because our job is limited and we are not allowed to process or even do all the customer's request but to connect them to a supervisor. And the most enjoyable part of the job is that You yourself is learning"
good,"* Every day for fun"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"I have learned a lot of things on how to extend patience in a way to serve better customer satisfaction, time management, punctual at all times, broader understanding in customer needs and wants, and to communicate to the customers in their own pace and understanding. I also have learned as a team-player where each of us needs to contribute our own Key Performance Indicators or metrics set to improve or maintain our ranking as a team and at the same time for the quality of the company."
good,"Convergys is a fast pace company where you answer calls based on At&t  customers. Dealing with plans, payments, and technical issues"
good,"Convergys was a great company to work under. My job consisted on taking calls for patient calling inquiring about services for Walgreens such as checking the status of medications, refilling medications and answering store inquiries. I learned to be efficient with my time and how to address patients. I mostly did not interact much with co-workers since we all have our own areas to conduct our jobs. The hardest part of the job was fulfilling the requests of patients with the standard time set by the company as multiple requests or patients unsure about what to request were a common occurrence. I enjoyed the work environment and the benefits the company provided, plus the company was very helpful to get a new employee caught up to company standards."
good,"i have  improve my skill&  handling team ."
good,"it was amazing working there in such a beautiful process."
good,"I enjoy working for Convergys, the atmosphere of the job was extremely comfortable. The employees are really friendly and you they make sure that you feel really welcome. The only reason I decided to depart from the job is because I have a family to support and I needed more than what they were offering."
good,Concentrix provides an incredibly enjoyable workplace. Great people to work with and diverse opportunities within the company. Management is a bit limited in staff and overall direction but they try to balance keeping contracts and keeping employees happy as best as they can.
good,"Minacs call center is a vibrant , fun, and competitive place to work.  Assisting Netflix customers with a great customer experience as well as the right resolution for troubleshooting and billing matters is a very important part of my job. Music, movies, and competitive games  keeps us motivated as a team, and it unlike any call center where you stare at a computer screen all day long.  Team work is a big part of us being a great call center.  You'll never be left to question if your giving the customer the right answers because everyone is very helpful in your achievement and growth in this company because we all have 2 goals.......RIGHT RESOULUTION , GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE.  The hardest part of the job can be dealing push back from our customers, but the most enjoyable part of the job is the support you get for helping you deal with difficult situations like that.  It can be pretty tough because it can be mentally draining, but working at this call center is the most fun you'll ever have at a job to counter act with it all."
good,"This position dealt with the New England customer base providing technical support for internet and phone lines of business to residential customers. Management was helpful and involved in focusing on strengthening areas needing improvement. Always accessible our staff were very personable and approachable. Job was in customer service for clients who are upset that their service is not working. Sometimes easy , sometimes hard our goal is/was to resolve the issue and restore faith in our companies' ability to provide stable service. I enjoyed solving issues for customers from the comfort of my own home because I am a technical person and like to know how things work or how to fix them resulting in a happy customer who appreciates what I do and they know we appreciate them for their business as well. A reciprocal relationship like that makes what we do worthwhile."

good,My stay with Convergys is a great one. The managers are professional.
good,This place was good it was fast paced and everyone was always talking on the phones getting stuff finished. I learned how to operate the phones and all the systems but it was very difficult to learn about 10 different systems almost. Co-workers were good and the hardest part of the job was when we would deal with irritated customers and they would get so mad and hang up then call back hitting out repeat rates. I enjoyed getting help from the employees around me.
good,Our managers at convergys were always on the job with how they could satisfy our needs and wants to come to work and have a great experience with their customers

good,A typical day at work is to get customer to keep their service with AT&T offering incentives. I learned how to work out solutions to most of the customer problems before they canceled their service. Management was great. I had the best co-workers ever during training but after training we did not communicate because the job was done from the comfort of my home. The hardest part of the job was loosing a customer after you have tried hard to get them to keep their service with AT&T. The most enjoyable part of the job is speaking with the customers.

Die Kolegen waren die meisten Schuhlkolegen also waren alle sehr nett und hilfsbereit. Mir persönlich gefiel mir am meisten an dieses job die Überaschung. Niemals habe ish gewusst wenn ich dran habe und was für ein Anligen er hat. Der job kam auch mit viel freude, weil man jeden Kunden hilf und Anliegen lösste."
good,You are basically the front lines of the support system for AppleCare.
good,"Productive fun place to work. Great benefits. Consult with clients on their problems, give them directions and sell them minutes to their car phone. Management was not what I expected they were not all up on their game plan. Management needed more training on dealing with co-workers. The hardest part of the job was to maintain a 100% on adherence. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people that were truly genuine about being your friend."

good,"A typical day at Convergys was similar to my job at ADT. First, I would log into the computer at my desk and get my headset ready to go. Then, I would prepare for the incoming calls to speak with customers and assist them with their needs. I learned a lot about the Credit Card business working at Convergys. Management was so much fun and we were always having luncheons and potlucks to make it more of a family environment. Co workers were also treated like family. And I am still friends with a lot of co workers from Convergys.  Hardest part of the job was dealing with customer's money without them getting upset. Best part of the job, defnitely the luncheons and pot lucks."

good,"Convergys is the most drama-free, positive place I have ever worked. People in my department (Content Quality Assurance) truly worked as a team with no information hoarding or competitive sabotage. I have never been in a company where everyone I interacted with, both within and outside my team, was so energetic, supportive, positive, professional, and competent. Convergys also understands the need for work-life balance and offers work-from-home days and allows you to choose your daily work schedule. Working with people all over the globe was fascinating."

good,Convergys is a great place to work with many opportunities for advancement. The staff is friendly and diverse. Management is focused on coaching you to the next level if an interest in upward mobility is shown. Pay is not competitive.
good,"Taking phone calls assisting CSR's with questions and taking escalated phone calls. I learned how to not take what others say personally. How to change the tone of a phone call. Management was great and allowed different opportunities for those that work towards them. The hardest part was being yelled at daily. The most enjoyable part was that overtime was in abundance, co-workers and management were great."

good,"Data entry, learned about several different charts, graphs, spreadsheets. Co-workers were very helpful and informative on aspects of your job and theirs.

good,Shift Timings
good,A typical day at work consisted of taking inbound calls addressing customers concerns. The hardest part of the job was sine it was awork at home if there was a internet outage I was unable to work because that is how the inbound calls were routed to me. Co-workers were great and we all worked together as a team whenever we had general job related questions. The most enjoyable part of my job was resolving the customers concern.
good,"everyone seemed like a family, everyone looks after one another. Laid back and very understandable"
good,"Convergys was my first full scale call center/CSR job. I enjoyed it there and advanced pretty quickly. However, they moved and it made getting to work a little difficult. I then searched out work and got a job elsewhere. It was a good work environment."
good,Productive and fun workplace to assist customers with reducing cost for their calling and data plans.
good,"A typical day at work started with attending calls and providing assistance to high speed DSL customers. The experience of solving problems and reaching to a solution to every problem was an adventure in itself considering the fact that, there are so many aspects involved to troubleshoot network connectivity, co-workers were very helpful and friendly, the hardest part of the job was making major decisions in the absence of a manager, especially during late night hours. The most enjoyable part was getting to learn the core aspects of troubleshooting."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,It was an alright place to work though the management was a bit iffy. You'd change team leaders almost every two weeks because they would change schedules.
good,I can't say that Convergys isn't a great place to work. They give people plenty of opportunity for growth you just have to be willing to put in the time and Convergys can work for you. If you want a full-time gig with decent benefits why not work there. I myself am pursing other goals at the moment and Convergys simply didn't fit into that future.
good,Great place to work at but they chanegd the job describition to major selling. Did not like. Not a sales person. Getting cursed out everyday by customers. Wish they would have kept it the way it was when I first started.
good,A typical day at work well is now a routine. I learned many thing from working at convergys. I learned to be more confident speaking with other as well as customers. I also learned leadership which is what I enjoy. Management could used some organization. My co- workers became very well known friends. The hardest part of the job was dealing with how the customer feels and how we could satisfy the customer to our best resources. The most part I enjoy about the job is interacting with the customers.
good,taking between 40-50 inbound phone calls per day.
good,I need a day job as per my qualification
good,"I sit at a computer for 8 or more hrs a day taking inbound calls. I learned that a lot of people call in to there phone company with a number of issues. The management was open to possibilities. My co-workers were ok i mainly stayed to myself, working in a call center can be drama. Nothing hard about the job. Enjoyable time when the company gives certificate to associates for outstanding job."
good,Was a great place of helping GM dealers in keeping their dealerships running smoothly.
good,"I really would love to work for this company again! Training provided, hands on, they work well and motivate well."
good,"I would recommend anybody work at Concentrix.  The only reason I left was to pursue a higher education, otherwise I would still be there.  The wages are pretty hard to beat, and they certainly pay you more than any other call center around here.  The building is beautiful, and they even have a slide in the lobby!"

good,"Your experience at Concentrix will largely depend on the client you are supporting. Different contracts have different metrics that need to be met.  Some client contacts are WAY more stressful than others.  On our particular contract, I find the collaboration between team members, staff, floor agents and management second to none! We work together as best as possible to get through the difficult day and keep things as positive and upbeat as possible! This is the culture we try to foster at the Belleville site. I can't speak for the other sites as they have their own culture. I've always found our management team very helpful, friendly and respectful at all times. I only wish the current contract I'm on paid a bit better to match some of the other contracts at this site. Overall I'm happy though!"
good,Great pay  . So much benefits and I loved helping costumers felt like I was saving life’s loved working here never a dull moment also all the employees were helpful

good,"Everyday is relaxing to be honest, because you're sitting down in your own cubicle taking inbound calls. Answering questions, fixing problems, and most importantly making every customer feel appreciated and happy. I learned that everyone goes through things in life, so if someone calls angry or sad; just talk to them and try to either get to the bottom of the issue or take their mind off of it even if I can't help them. The hardest part sometimes was trying to calm down extremely angry customers, who have their mind made up and if you can't give them what they want; either wants to escalate to a manager or cancel their service.

I learned something new everyday about the systems and how to master my work. Management was OK in the beginning and then began to turn for the worse. Workplace culture was awesome. Hardest part of the job was the management not being able to really help the reps. because the reps. begin to know more then them, due to the firing and quieting of the supervisors and the hiring of young non experienced supervisors. The most enjoyable part of my job was hitting all my required numbers and achieving top pay out."

good,"A call center is an interesting place to work. MY experience is probably a lot different than others have had. I was the Administrative Assistant for the whole center and there were times that we had up to 500 agents. My job was fun because if someone was sent down to my office it was for either a prize, a treat or a fun visit. Convergys tires to come up with fun and creative ways to reward and encourage their sales staff. They try to meet schedules the best they can but it doesn't always work out.  When you are dealing with that many agents, you always have various issues that will come up and have to be addressed.

good,"It is my great opportunity working with my present employer"
good,Best job ive ever had. The people were always great and happy. I advanced in only 3 months of being there. Hard work does not go unnoticed or unrewarded. You feel respected and appreciated. The only draw back was the management. They seemed bothered with questions. And took more pride in standing around talking or playing games than they did being of assistance. They were condescending and derived joy from lording their status over the call agents. And would always try to steal the credit from someone under them.

This job had the best heath care coverage and incentives as well as employee appreciation. I really miss working for this company. The co workers were phenomenal and so were the managers. The managers pushed you until you grew and they never gave up on you. Everyone wanted to see you grow and be the best you could be inside the company.

good,Typically I would strive to get to work before it was time to clock in to get my area ready to the days work. I would take at least 3-5 calls per hour depending on how fast or slow a day we were having. I learned how not to let situations take control of me but how to take control. Management had its ups and downs. Some managers paid more attention than other and some cared a lot about how we were doing and how to help us move up in the company. The hardest part of my job was handling extremely irate customers that would not want to understand the situation or how to deal with it. The most enjoyable part of my job was when a customer would thank me for my patience and understanding and give me a good review to my manager.

good,"recognizes agent effort"
good,"I saw that all employees are working together to invite many applicant in order to meet their quota for the month, I am happy because I became part of this company, they treated me as their own employee even though I am just an intern. The difficult part of the job was on how to prioritize the applicant, because sometimes I do the work of my co-intern so the tendency is, I have to do multi-tasking to finish everything quickly. The most happiest moment here in my job was everyone love what their doing that is why we help each other if someone has the problem."
good,"A typical day at work would start with a cup of coffee and checking the daily scheduled reports,emails of clients and maintaining the servers either remotely or over phone.The management keeps up the good work by bringing new business into the company which makes us as workers more enthusiastic in knowledge sharing about the pros and cons of the product or the software and by which way these cons can be rectified during the course of time.The most enjoyable part of the job would be helping any client during his times of jeopardy and that would in-turn be the hardest part if we were not successful and to relax at the end of the day a game of snooker will do the job."

Most of all I have learnt that I am the type of person that doesn't mind change, I welcome it and just get on with the job at hand. I will not make excuses for doing something wrong, I will take the feedback and work on improving it. I have discovered I have a good impact on other people and can help drive people towards achieving there own targets with simple things such as friendly competition within a small group or helping them understand a better way of approaching things. The hardest part of the job is listening to people who are so unhappy in there role and trying to remain positive myself, I feel I manage it quite well usually I will try and cheer them up and if this doesn't work I will remove myself from the situation so it doesn't affect my own role."

I learned the process of sales and basic troubleshooting steps for cable, internet and home phone but the hardest part of my job is trying to convince customer about the advantages of the product we have thus we can process a sales and earn more commission. Another thing is my shift since we are working during night shift.

In addition, the management and my co-workers are easy to cope with."

My co-workers are what makes the job great. I get along great with all of my co-workers and have made many great friends while being employed here at Convergys.

The most important thing I learned at this job was how to sell and that also became the most enjoyable part of the job.

good,working in Minacs is a very good experience as it was a fast paced environment with efficient team members and motivated with a new agenda every day. We as a team easily achieve the sale quota. Supervisors and Managers were very cooperative.
good,"enjoyed answering calls and helping out our customers . even though when u answered the call some where very upset over there bills or service from previous rep usally could calm them down enough to resolve there issues .hardest part i think was to keep your self esteem up as some cust tomers would call u names and degrade you , had to rememvber they do not know u personally and that they where mad really at there bills and cell phones .i enjoued resolving there issues made me feel like i did something good for someone when they where finished there call and praise you for a good job and sometiomes wanted to speak to your manger to tell them so."
good,I loved just about everything about working for the IRS. The job was seasonal. Too much off and on.
good,"I would go take calls from customers that had credit cards with Bank of America and I would help them resolve issues they had with their credit account, waive applicable fees, and answer any questions they had about their account(s). I learned how to manage a credit card whenever I get one, & how to deal with irate customers. I was pretty friendly with anyone who was friendly with me and I made a couple friends and so it made going to work easier and funner. The hardest part of the job is sitting for so long and doing so much of the same thing it could get old quick. but they tried to change it up by making games and stuff that not only livened things up but also kept people working at their sale goals and numbers. The best part of the job was that you pretty much new what you were doing and how to do it and when it needed to be done and if you messed up it was all on you."
good,The most enjoyable part of the workday was clocking in and going to work with others who enjoyed their job. I learned alot of customer service skills while woking at Convergys.

good,I loved working for this company. Only issue when changing team leads they need the right people. Cause they forgot that if you provide good sales and provide greet customer service then you have long term customers.
good,"It is a very stressful job,you get a lot of rude customers but you learn how to handle them. I learn how to answer phone calls and how to help customers with their problems. The co workers that you had were very nice. The hardest part of the job was the rude customers you may get. the most enjoyable part of the job was you co worker were very freindlyand nice."
good,best place ive ever worked even though you dont get paid much the people are very much like family.
good,It was fun I really enjoyed working for the company.
good,Convergys is a good place to work but it has lost a lot of perks. We use to get incentives for perfect attendance to boost morale.
good,I loved comming into work knowing that I get to talk to people all over the worl. The only thing wrong with this place is the management but you learn to get use to it. I would come into work sit at my desk and start taking calls helping people get their Onstar activated. Tha hardest part of this job would be dealing with angry yelling customers. Th most enjoyable part of my day is all day at Onstar.
good,I am a student and parent. Convergys was a stable job and a great enviornment to work in
good,I would love to go back to the company great benefits working on a team is what makes a great company

good,"It's fun to work in this company, however their schedule is a bit messy because it changes everyday. They don't have a permanent schedule and it causes for the employees to adjust or manage their time. Most specially because they can't rest or sleep well. See for example; the shift ended at 11am and the next shift will start too early. That's the only thing that I don't really like,overall the company is very good to work in."

good,"Management was good, working environment was also good, team leads were very helpful, only the thing I did not like was ""no job security""."
good,"Being a fraud analyst is challenging. You have to open an investigation if fraud on the account really exist and assist customers if their card is not working especially if there is a suspected fraud activity. The most challenging part is the verification process wherein you need to authenticate the caller over the phone. Though most of the time you will be dealing with irate customers,  you will feel accomplished/satisfied if at the end of the day you were able to help.  "
good,Healthy environment to work and good support by the administration. Had a wonderful relationship with the company and has very much employee benefits.

What I learned from the company is that you are treated fairly and has planned to make your day easier in processing important papers. I have no complains with the management in keeping the employees happy. The culture is simple and  everyone can easily relate as you will be treated welcome. The hardest part of the job is doing your job and attaining your goal for a position as everybody is your competitor in a good way. The most enjoyable part of the job is that even you are following a different Time Zone you are still human who can enjoy life with your family and colleagues,"

good,"regardless of how cramped the office areas are, it was balanced by how they trained their agents. I learned a lot when it comes to time and attitude etiquette. They will make you one of the most advanced and self-reliant agents and you will learn discipline as well. How to make realization out of your own deeds and will take your skills on a master level. The site managers and Team Leaders will make you work your way up by growing on your lapses and mistakes. That's where I learn to cope up with my mistakes and do what my best no matter what. I've been the top agent since my 1st day up until my last day. Salary increases whenever you did a great job for the whole period."
good,"I have been working at concentrix for about a year and a half. I find nothing wrong with them I get my 40 hrs and opportunities to advance. 90 percent of the managers are amazing to work with.The job is simple but not easy, and you get out what you put into it!!!"

good,You will learn a lot even i'm just a intern they help me to enhance my knowledge. And help me to be a responsible HR Staff and be a flexible worker who can manage all things.

good,"a typical day at work depending on the season it can go from slow as 5 calls an hour to 350 calls needing to be done in a day."
good,"Convergys is a rewarding work opportunity if you are able to manage the slight shift adjustments. I believe that if it was not for lack of transportation and unavailability of schedule desire, I would be keeping my employment with Convergys. I will try to return in a year when I know for a fact I will have open availability."

good,Worked at convergys for 3 months then left but my time there was good . Managers are really helpful . If u get caught with something or they have a go at you later on they dont hold a grudge against you. I liked this place even though the pay wasnt on top. Training for 2 weeks was like being in highscool. I loved the job. Shifts were the only downside about the place. As a call centre enviroment which has over 800 staff members working inside i would say its still pretty wrll looked after.  You'll be treated well if you be well.
good,"On a typical day, we pick US and Canada Office 365 cases and proactively send emails and then call the users who have already purchased the subscription to check and know if there is any issue. If there is one, we help by providing technical support, otherwise, we help with any queries and close the case."
good,"Convergys is a place where you'll feel that you belong. They don't stereotype, equality and fairness is always present in this company. They're the best!"

good,I  actually loved working for Convergys it was my perfect job. Even though the company took on other companies we never felt the pressures. The HR was more than concerned with us overral and the atmosphere was pleasant. The staff was phenomenal and I was hoping I retired there.

good,"A typical day work would look like this. You walk in, friendly staff greeting you. You sit at your desk and wait for the call. The call comes. On the other end, a sweet old lady is having trouble with her phone network. You politely give instructions and thank her for calling. You do this for the rest of the day. What I learned is that many people will have phone issues, but that's why we're here. The management is amazing. The friendly tutorial staff, to help you get started, are very patient and help send you on your way. The hardest part of the job is trying not to lose your patience. Some people call 4-5 times a day, but they're just trying to figure their device out. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to help everyone with their technology problems."
good,I truly love working with Convergys because its filled with worlds leading brands process and we have good Carrier growth and good work environment filled with completely technical knowledge people.

good,"Each day brought its challenges with it, but nothing that could not be overcome. It is a very busy environment and I was fortunate enough to be able to work in another company for Convergys ( USA) due to the advancement and career opportunities that were given to me. Management was extremely supportive and open to ideas that would always help the moral of our employees if it was needed. The workplace culture was fun and numerous friends were made. It was high stress due to the high numbers that were expected to be achieved, but the training and support was there also for those that needed it. The hardest part of the job  is always when you have to let people go and managing those that continue to push the envelope."
good,"Great Place to start your Carrier with, awesome work atmosphere, great managers, challenging work, only downside is Night Shifts, but worth it. You get Core knowledge on Microsoft OS."

good,The working hours are too long(10 Hours and 20 Minutes) also the salary is very less as compared to working hours. Beside this everything thing is perfect.
good,Its good to work there. But the crataria what they lock for promotion that was not good. I think they should work on this and according to work rate the employees.

good,"I loved working at Convergys. The few things I loved was the hourly pay and commission on top of that. Hour for lunch and 2 mandatory 15 minute breaks daily. Sometimes hard to hear customer due to loud music or loud announcments made from managers and team leaders. Sometimes had great customers and sometimes had terrible rude customers. Overall I enjoyed my time at Convergys. My trainer was a great trainer and person. Helped me through more than I could imagine in the training process. One thing I can say for sure is, during the training process, they could work on getting you more familiar with all the different things you need to help customers before sending you on the floor. They tell you all the time when you first go on the floor and take calls its terrible and everyone is not completely ready, which i absolutely hated about the job. But once on the floor for a while you sorta got the hang of everything and it became a lot easier."

We usually go home after work but sometimes, we drink beers, we chat, we watch movie, we go out of town-only when approved by the management team to use or vacation leaves- or just walk around in the mall. In my work as a sales and customer service representative, I learned how to be more interactive with other people, be more flexible on our schedules, be more ambitious in my goals. With the management team, I learned how to be more professional not only to our CUSTOMERS but also my friends and co workers and our daily lives. My urge to become more successful with the training and advises of our management team.

The machine produces egg yolk and it dumps it into 50lb boxes. so you have to ensure the weight is correct, close up the boxes, and then set it up on pallets. each pallet takes 30 boxes, so you wrap that up with ropes, and you put on labels. once its done you take it to these big heather and you line them up with forklifts to dry further, once thats done you take the boxes to a sampling room, make sure the PH levels are good. and send it to the shipping unit to get shipped overseas."

good,Very productive and comfortable to work with. The training was very informative. The job was very challenging yet fulfilling. I highly recommend concentrix
good,"Ho lavorato per Concentrix sentendomi da subito il benvenuto e parte della grande famiglia. Raramente ho trovato tanto supporto, comprensione e stimolo nel dare il meglio di me per il bene di tutto il team in altri posti. Lo staff è sempre stato pronto e risolutivo per me e per tutti i colleghi appena arrivati. I TL sono sempre pronti a venire incontro ai dipendenti ma non andando mai contro i regolamenti interni. Purtroppo a causa di incomprensibili accordi sindacali non firmati dai sindacati stessi, ho dovuto lasciare l'azienda per non possibilità di rinnovo. Se non avessi già trovato lavoro e mi dovessero chiedere di tornare, lo farei subito per ritrovare quell'ambiente sereno e divertente anche quando le giornate sono toste. E' grazie a tutti loro se oggi ho trovato la stabilità che non ho potuto trovare in Concentrix. Li ringrazierò per sempre, tranne i dipendenti storici che credono che tutto gli sia dovuto, compreso lo stipendio senza nessuno sforzo."
good,Concentrix is a good company to work for. It is employee centric company. Management is good and will not use harsh words. Documentation is done as per the process to highlight any oppertunity.
