good,"Productive and fun workplace with great people and room for advancement. "
bad,"Poor benefits. Poor management!!!  Lack of respect for experienced workers, lay you off before your pension matures out of greed. Very sad to have dedicated so much time with a company, then to be treated so badly in the end."
bad,Great bunch of people to work with but management are a waste of space .They preach about health and safety but do nothing about it especially Area supervisors .The  Vans they give you are barely road legal always promise things but never deliver on them .long hours and not much money especially agency staff
bad,"Understaffed and over worked for low pay. Dealt with dangerous chemicals outside in the heat with few breaks to hydrate. Fast paced, poor planning.. management was quick to threaten your job."
bad,"Air Products purchased company that was well established in manufacturing processes and they came in and insisted on change."
bad,Apex industrial gas services .      Worked there for five years . Manager was awful  and a bully  and racist used threatening  behaviour to manipulate the staff and get results  for his benefit . Airproducts seem to turn a blind eye to the issue . Salery very poor to the amount of work done  . All they want is a robot worker  to use and abuse.  Will send you all over the country living in poor b and b . Living on limited expenses.  All work and no life  .
bad,"I was employed at air product's training was a joke when out on road with experienced driver, head office would send out work for us both to do, I was rushed around so we both could get finished that was a 12hr day+. When  I went for interview I was told it would be a 9and half hrs I thought this sounds great,  I was lied to , then when you  pass out on what you have been trained up on head office just piled the work on and expect you to be as fast as experienced  people that have worked at air product's for a few years, if you like long hours ie 12hrs plus ,and don't mind been compared to experienced staff go for it ,if you like a home life and only want to do 10 hours a day  keep well away , not very nice  to work  for"
bad,It's a very stressful place to work with very long hours. Overly competitive. Not a great place for advancement for most employees. No work/life balance.
bad,"Air Products was the best company I have ever work for! The company had great benefits, there was alot of over time, great people to work with, and alot of support from upper management."
bad,The plant in Air product in galt they discriminated latinos becareful with. The manager joel he is a punk  jackie is cool but joel hates latino is not cool
bad,The Edmonton site is plagued by poor managers locally.  It is a very interesting place to work and you will learn a lot.  Managers are poorly trained and have little ability to be effective in there rolls.  I regret taking the position there.
bad,Big powerful and full of monsters in charge. Their way of management is like book other! Makes 100%  no sense! You'll pull your hair out trying to understand why they go one step forward to want to stay three steps backwards! One day when you think your doing great and your career is going fine you'll end up being punished like a kid and for god knows what and no one can answer your questions for what's the reason your odd man out. Its almost like they test to see how much insanity you can take just to have a management game of sport to have fun in the offices.
bad,"Company is not welcoming to new members of staff. There are many members of staff who have been with the company for several years and not progressed. The company does not have a plan for staff to develop and grow, if your a yes person and willing to be walked all over then you stand a slim chance of progression."
bad,They couldn't have cared less about Safety and Training was non-existent. we were contractors on a customers site and Management took advantage of this by keeping everything broken just so they would always have something to fix. Success was a moving target. Job never changed but Managers shuffled the procedure steps around every 8 months or so just to have something to do.
bad,Not much life outside work. Your shift will be starting at night for years. Managers are terrible.  Seniority Driver s are all about the company. They look at new guys like they are stepping on their toes.
bad,"From Alcoholic/child supervisors talking you down, too upper management ensuring you know you are replaceable. Favoritism/disrespect is a huge deal."
good,"Productive and fun workplace with great people and room for advancement. "
bad,"In the beginning it was a great place to work for. As time went on things only got worse. Training was horrible even in the beginning. Had to search, beg and plead to get trained. Caught on and worked hard to only find out there were things that i was supposed to be doing but never even knew of. So many changes and layoffs... management was self involved and did not care about employees. Only care about keeping their jobs. Employees were great to work with but management needs major work."
bad,"The place is just a facade of an underlying dis-functional bunch of ""good ole boys"". "
bad,"It's not what you know, it's who you know at this plant.  Some were favored, while others were crucified at every turn.  The workplace culture was straight from a 1960's 'good ol boy' job shop."
bad,"Hiring takes forever! Training takes 6 months! A fine job for someone fresh out of driving school, but not a job I would call a career! Management is a joke! Corporate is even useless!"
bad,"If you do a days work you will be punished by being laid off. Most workers were slackers and those who weren't, had to behave in such a way as to look like slackers. People would sleep on the job. The management is out of control, or should I say have no control, or don't want to control. Corporate would come in help with the ""back log"" or work. Most workers spent the day on the phone or on facebook. Corporate should have a closer look at what goes on in Leetsdale."
bad,"A very non diverse place to work, very few African Americans employed."
bad,des heures de travail a ne plus en finir . toujours plus
bad,"Great job and some really good work colleagues but "
bad,"Air Products is a very cheap company that understands its plants. You will be doing the role of 2-3 people, and as a result you’ll be constantly called out, working excessive hours, and you’re always busy. The benefits are mediocre compared to the rest of the Gulf Coast, but pay is up there. "
bad,Management is all about the dollar they can take out of the company today and not the company's existence tomorrow!!! This is not a place you can retire from and they will likely discard you or the doors will fold first.
bad,"I worked for 27 years as a bulk delivery driver from Hull and in the early years the job was a good one, "
bad,"lot of job responsibilities to make an impact."
bad,"Working short handed all the time. No job security. I learned that even if you don""t like your job you need to give it 100%. If you dislike it find another place to work if it will not effect your family to much."
bad,"Don,t even bother stepping foot inside this company as I've heard it is now like rats leaving a sinking sink. They are making redundant all the time and have no sympathy for anyone even some who had worked there for many years. I've heard they just make people redundant to get them off the pension liability. The management is rudderless and toothless and give no direction to their employees. One to keep clear of for sure."
bad,"mentalité très vieille, et personnel beaucoup trop hésitant quant à votre rôle en tant qu'intérimaire."
bad,The managers are clowns. They don't know their elbow from the hole in their head. There is no real training. Safety is a joke. Managers do not care about the workers. You'll be expected to change your schedule at the last minute. They look down upon you if you speak up. Unrealistic expectations
bad,"Originally a great start-up turned high stress. As the company progressed from start-up to Air Products to Versum, the overhead corporate pressure increased more and more. Employees are told that they make the company but then told it's all about the share holders and keeping them happy. Upper management is awful. They collect fat bonuses while promotions and bonuses suffer beneath. You literally cannot advance unless you have a PhD. Even Master's degrees have poor career advancement. If you have a bachelor's degree stay away. Beware, they have a non-compete so once you sign it be prepared for lack of growth and increasing stress!"
good,"Productive and fun workplace with great people and room for advancement. "
bad,The money is at Airproduts is good the work is very professional management or not the drivers go out their way to To serve the business especially the customer this used to be appreciated but no further that’s all I’ve got to say on the matter
bad,Pay is pretty good when your working but sucks when all you have is a 40 HR check. No stability. Not sure if your working day to day. No formal training in place. If you want a home or family life this is not the place. May have to leave home at the drop of a dime Supervisor was only around for health benefits.
bad,"Lack of equipment,  equipment is never ready always sitting around waiting for the shop. Shop time is paid, but now there’s a time issue getting trips completed. Micro managed  to death, always being watched. Cameras on site and in trucks. Driving and filling at customer sites are the best part."
bad,"If you fit the mold and was a friend of someone in management outside of work then you could advance, if not then you were treated like a second class citizen, and always reminded of how easy it is to fire you."
bad,"You never know for how long you will be able to work... they have not regard for workers or for the quality of the work... Managers have no ethics."
bad,"nedoporučuji práci v této společnosti, nebot není dobré vedeni"
bad,"No real guidance on your job they want you to do, The management have their favorite people, which can do no wrong in their sight, well they do a lot of wrong, but its over looked, it appears because they go into a foul mouth rant to move the suspension to someone else other than themselves. I wish I could write something nicer, lots of free food, left over from upper management lunch meetings. Its better than throwing it out, a lot of the same people rush down to eat."
bad,"Air Products and Chemicals has a very high attrition rate, especially in the California region. Their compensation is not competetive when compared to similar licensed professional positions. The management has a rule of convienence, where as, when it is most convienent for management the rules will be re-written. They have been operating the Wilmington hydrogen plant without un-licensed high pressure boiler operators for over 10 years. They are also required to have a turbine endorement which 3 out of the four of the Senior Control Room Operators DO NOT HAVE."
bad,Projects are given to the sr project technicians that have been with the company for 20 years or more.
bad,"Long hours on projects, mgt would lecture about meals one can consume during the day, eg. don't eat after 20:00 to save money. Theft of service's test equipment by another employee; HR would not investigate the incident nor would punish the individual."
bad,Currently am bitter towards Air Products and find it difficult to fairly evaluate.  I felt I have been mistreated after 24 years of high quality work.  Atmosphere is fearful/toxic at this time.
bad,"a bunch of old school people trying to make it  retirement.  They no longer innovate, and succeed by reducing costs quarter over quarter.  They are the low cost kings."
bad,Was hired in January 2014 and was let known but July 2014 the plant was closing in 2015. Just to say that the over all experience was not good and I am not fond of this company.
bad,"Hired in as an associate underwriter - their term for a glorified customer service rep.  Company expects you to do too many things. I can multitask, but the sheet amount of busy work here and constant interruptions on the phone was exhausting."
bad,The environment was not healthy. Overstressed most of the time and management seemed to only care about the good old boy club members. Advancement was next to possible!
bad,"It is a stagnant work environment full of ""no"" people ... new ideas are immediately shut down. "
good,"Productive and fun workplace with great people and room for advancement. "
bad,"Great benefits, pay is within market standards, inconsistent in how employees are treated within departments. Managers say they want to help promote you but they do not actually help to make this happen."
bad,"1. Unloading trucks, Filling the tanks and deliver"
bad,I liked working here. If the plant did not shut down I would probably still be working there. I enjoyed traveling with the company and expanding my certifications.
bad,"Plenty of interesting engineering/design and redesign work to be done, including discovery of many lurking design, fabrication, and installation problems."
bad,"Good industry; good performance but high stress. Come only if you are okay with hardball.  People have excellent skills, but prepared to east their young if necessary."
bad,Wrong people in management positions.  Creating an unpleasant and stressful and low moral environment.  Placing low or inexperienced people in management positions
bad,"Purchase the right flowers from the right suppliers (purchasing);"
bad,"Decent enough place to work with good benefits package. It's only as rewarding as you make it, which is true for many careers. Air Products loyalty to their own employees is suspect."
bad,"The company has historically been a ""boys club"" of nepotism shrouded behind bureaucracy.  The new CEO was hired to revamp the company into a well-run meritocracy, and he has been slowly installing managers beneath him to execute his strategy.  However, the existing mid/low-level managers only know the ""old way"" of doing things and are overwhelmed by the demands to solve problems instead of punting on them."
bad,"The company seems to have more managers than actually workers, these managers all seem to cover there own backsides so they don't get made redundant "
bad,"great fellow employees. ""good ole boy"" system in play with mgrs. liked challenge of getting units back in service quickly and under budget.  experience is no longer required to excel in company."
bad,Veel nieuwe dingen geleerd inzake logistieke oplossingen op afstand.
bad,Didn't like us because we were union. management was not very good with the work force at all.
bad,Empresa altamente política nao propiciando desta forma um plano de cargos e salários de acordo com sua competencia e sim de acordo com quem vc conhece. Colegas de trabalho altamente competitivos gerando desconforto no ambiente. Parte mais agradavel do trabalho é ver tudo seus esforços pessoais se transformarem em instalações que acrescentarão em benefícíos para seu cliente. A parte mais difícil do trabalho é o retorno de qualquer informação solicitada
good,"Productive and fun workplace with great people and room for advancement. "
bad,company gives site managers too much power.  They don't come from the trucking industry and let you know that.  expect to be at beck and call of logistics.  I hope you like big brother because thats what is about there.  They come up with these corporate goals and nag you about them but than when a specific truck gets 5mpg instead of turning it in or parking it they mile it out all while complaining about fuel mileage.   I could go on but this is just a little insight
bad,"New management has killed the company and does not care.  Used to be a fun place to work.  People are great but constantly looking over their shoulder waiting for the next shoe to drop.  Cleaning house, getting rid of people with experience.  Little opportunity for advancement."
bad,"The people who make up Air Products perpetuate a culture of self-promotion. I am constantly disappointed by the lack of accountability shown by management. Employees seem more than happy to step on the backs of others to reach their goals, and it actually works. Look into the CEO's ""accomplishments"" as of late, and you'll get an idea of what Air Products values look like. I am not impressed with this company and am seeking employment elsewhere."
bad,Good for the money but the management feed you bunch of lies a lot of back stabbing goes on and if you want weekends off forget it you get stuck on a weekend shift. You did earn top money for it but it will cost you your marriage ( more than likely)
bad,If you think this job is the dream 1 your wrong..the days of it been top of the tree for drivers is long gone! Management forcing drivers to break t’s&c’s then disciplining then when they won’t!
bad,Look else where or if already working there look for another position to transition out.  It was a fine company to work at but now it is no longer a desirable place to work.
bad,"Comparative to other industrial workplaces in the Golden Triangle Area. Overall, it is a decent place to make a living. It is currently in a transitional period due to new CEO and aligning his principles throughout the company."
bad,Management style is out dated... reluctant to change
bad,"Only worked for airproducts for 3 years,based at AP teesvalley gasification plant,new build job for life but global management pulled the plug making everyone redundant,sold to all as excellent job oppurtunity many of us leaving good jobs only to be out on the street a few years later,many lads/still out of work years later"
bad,Participer activement au maintien à domicile des patients bénéficiant des soins complexes et variés.
bad,"Management rarely takes responsibility for anything, constant accidents,was told to be careful because the safety in the plant is horrible. Very few skilled workers in the plant causing constant problems in the quality of the product. Constantly putting a bandaid on everything and covering up problems especially accident rate. Think twice before relocating for this place."
bad,coming to work and performing me job to the best of my knowlege and willing to learn any project that is given to me. Respect co-worker and be a team player and i havent had a hardest part of a job. The most part enjoyable part of the job is good communication.
good,"Work Life Balance is not ""a thing"" at AP. The culture emphasizes the number of hours worked, not the value of the work produced. If you are someone who can sit at a desk all day and look busy, you will do fine in this culture. If you want to make a difference, your voice will probably not be heard unless you are very pushy and don't concern over who you step on while ladder climbing. In AP, it is certainly not about a work ethic, it is about networking and who you ally with."
good,"Worked at this company for 20plus years was a great company in its day not now. They rip you off on wages and expenses. And on your back all the time. Also get you to load when on your break if in yard, You are expected to work a 12 hour day if you don't you owe them the hours, Then you will be called in to work extra days, This company has no respect for the drivers .The sort of day would start at approx. 5am and finish at 1700,with them tracking you and any delays they would be on the phone why have you not moved?, If you have a family forget this job as you wont see them much you get home dinner then bed as you are so tired. Would not recommend this company"
good,"Productive and fun workplace with great people and room for advancement. "
good,Good company Good pay long hours 10+ a day. But manager and supervisor sucks. I don't think they never driven a truck before so they don't know what it's like to be a driver. All they know is how to sit behind a computer and email. Other than that great company.
good,"Not Bad. Management is terrible at this particular facility. No communication, no leadership, weak execution, unfair management practices like discriminatory firings, hazing, and restructuring. The soon to be Versum management operates in a vacuum with no input to the pain in the field, therefore poor decisions and poor implementation of systems and programs."
good,Took the job as a welder..Had to cross train for other jobs due to lay offs every 2 or 3 years..
good,"collegues locaux sympas"
good,The position I had was only rated if and when there was a negative customer experience. Long hours were expected when shifts were open due to illness and vacations.
good,"After being a employee of APCI for more than 5 years.  I feel that things at the Conyers GA Terminal have changed for the Worst. The pay is still great although some things have been cut from the drivers pay. Logistics runs the show, and pretty much what they say goes. The Site Manager is pretty good to go, BUT there needs to be a replacement of the the Site Supervisor. The operators are great and the group of drivers are fine to work with. There is supposed to be a open door policy at AP. However, I have learned that if you contact Allentown about anything that you believe to be unfair, you better have another opportunity lined up. You are going to need it shortly there after. "
good,"Great place to work, best ever 17 years ago, times changed and now the management in not interested in people only profits for executives and investors."
good,"Tinha que avaliar as prioridades e as compras de maior impacto financeiro que atenderia clientes e novos clientes."
good,Mes missions étaient très diversifiées dans l'entreprise. J'en garde un bon souvenir.
good,"there seem to be a crisis at all time when there wasn't really, generally chaotic at all times, performing duties and responsibility were enjoyable if you could get past the management"
good,"Management informed the team of upcoming layoffs and that most of our jobs were secure--only two would be affected. In reality, most of the team was let go. Very unsettling since those employees that had a minimum of 12 years of service."
good,High turn over and lack of business direction. Branch locations treated as red headed step child. Lack of proper training to employees. Just stuck in roles due to lay off without ever being properly trained.
good,overall good place  to work good staff before  they bought in new management that didn't have your best interest in mind a lot back stabbing
good,"I have worked here less than a year and have seen 3 sets of layoffs due to poor investments done by corporate. There are not enough employees here to handle the work demand due to the layoffs."
good,The company used to be an exciting and interesting place to work. Many of the people still employed there are worried about the company and their jobs. The company has changed dramatically over the last two plus years since a new CEO has been appointed.
good,"The Air Products I'm a part of was initiated through an acquisition, The culture and politics of the old company has remained and leadership from AP is doing nothing about it."
good,"although this job was a good paying job there were health issues that were very much a detriment. They used flourine gas to coat the bottles inner lining. The MSDS for flourine stated "" the most corrosive gas know to man. Eats all living tissue"". The work was very interesting and a learning experience. Job title was.operator/mechanic. I ran up to 3 blow molders and maintained any breakdowns that may occur during shift"
good,"Productive and fun workplace with great people and room for advancement. "
good,"good place to work, sold plant to Ashland in 2008."
good,"High Pressure Environment"
good,Very established and world renowned corporation. Large company with too many holding middle-management positions. Would have liked a manager wanting help grow my role and achieve higher expectations.
good,When I first started it was a great place to work.  Once the new CEO took over it was get rid of people and make those left work 3x harder it's all about the bottom line.
good,Air Products employs highly dedicated and committed individuals which enables the business units to be flexible and nimble as each employee brings new views and ideas to the table
good,Very successful Fortune 250 company. Nothing wrong with the company. It's the Microbulk Position is difficult because of competition. We can't compete with the little guy.
good,"I was responsible for managing a team of between six and twelve engineers. This included but not limited to training engineers, auditing work in the region and relaying feedback to team members, compiling on call-rota’s, authorizing holidays and the distribution of work. Ensuring that paper work is correct and in order. Distributing jobs and monitoring vehicle locations via computer systems. Site and stock management and health and safety. "
good,"Lots of great people.  Company overloaded with forms and processes.  Regular workers have almost no access to VP's, and generally not invited to any meetings with VPs.  Lots of talk about making improvements, but most improvements are for show, with no real substance.  Limited or no IT support.  Very restricted use of technology.  e.g. PM's not allowed to use MS Project.  SharePoint available, but nobody knows how to use it well, and IT does not allow SharePoint Designer to be used.  New CEO seems to have no market strategy and provides no guidance to regular workers about where the company is going, except for lots of layoffs."
good,"Air Products is a respectable company to work for.  Unfortunately, many very talented and qualified people lost their jobs since the new CEO took over in July."
good,"As a driver @ WAS a fantastic place to work, now NOT so fantastic with pay cuts it's now like any common carrier. We used to get paid as soon as we entered plant to load ( both drivers on teams) no give up first two hours and split team pay @ plants good hourly pay but if you have to split it only 10.00 hr and this 2 hr.give up time is EVERY TIME you change your duty status, so you may sit all day and not make anything but allotted pay for loading! Gee..wonder if plant operators I used to see sleeping or watching movies were getting half pay at night?..NOT! Oh, if you're a driver, you're treated like scum by plant personnel, had one head plant lady say there's NO WAY our plant people could have left that mess in here.it must have been ""Those Truck Drivers""!..oh there's lots more!"
good,Large company. Not much loyality. Air products bought the company that I was working for 3 years. Not a bad transition.
good,"The job wasn't all that bad, but the micro-management was ridiculous. Busy work, make work, supervisors stalking you around the floor and hiding. Was on call 24/7/365, and expected to come in at least 70% of the time when called, but not really officially ""on call"" so they don't have to pay you for being on call. MO labor dept representative said it was pretty shady but legal. "
good,"Working for Air Products was great until the management and focus changed in 2013."
good,"Generally, the company looks like a fortune 500 company with its pay, benefits and stock options. "
good,"A empresa oferece ótimos benefícios com profissionais qualificados ficando uma oportunidade de melhoria gestão de pessoas por parte de gerentes."
good,"good place to start a career in sales but little room for advancement. "
good,"Productive and fun workplace with great people and room for advancement. "
good,"A typical day at work was any issues with any of the personnel was dealt with, ie vehicle problems,issue of any PPE. Also checking of bulk tank levels and needing to order if required. Checking e- mails and answering them, organising any vehicles that needed to go to the service provider for repairs or service.Taking calls from drivers who had any on site issues.My co-workers were mostly ex-service men who took pride in the job and were professional in every way. I also spent time on the road delivering Liquid Nitrogen and liquid Argon,to every type of business you could think of. The most enjoyable part of the job was the comarade,and solving any problems or issues that came about."
good,"Low morale and uncertain job security are the main issues at Air Products. Also, compensation is below average. On the positive side, the versatile roles expose you to wide range of responsibilities."
good,Don't do this to yourself if you respect yourself at all. The way they run the schedule is a shady backhanded way of avoiding overtime.
good,"Good place to work, stayed very busy. Worked with haz-mat  products did on site liquid fills. Pay was ok, worked alone most of the time, cylinder inventory and rotation biggest and most important part of job."
good,Relaxed work environment. A pleasure to work with an outsanding team of drivers. Very good at keeping the drivers up to date with D.O.T regulations. New equipment.
good,I worked for Ref-Chem as a contractor at Air Products location in Baytown. Typical work environment. Given I didn't work for the company I can't review them.
good,I put 30 years in. It’s a more progressive company now. Man power has been cut drastically. We don’t perform maintenance as much as we used to. Stock price is up ( which is good) but it’s not sustainable in long term in my opinion. People in the field are stressed.
good,The company has been around for many years and it has gone through periods of boom and bust. The overall feel however was a general feeling of depression.
good,"Worked here for less than one year in a newly created position for a small department within the organization.  Experience with management, counterparts, and plant personnel was minimal."
good,I worked there for 23 years and a manger comes in that dose not  like me and I 'am out the door very bad for me and my family  I came to work every day did my job never called in sick were all my PPE and worked overtime when needed
good,it is a hard job and very busy.  I enjoyed learning new stuff with co workers. Get along very well with others.  teamwork is the best.  very respectful.
good,Un trabajo bastante comodo y  con compañeros agradables.
good,"I loved working with the people there. I had a good relationship with the operators on shift work."
good,"Productive and fun workplace with great people and room for advancement. "
good,"Pay raises were below cost of living adjustments and bonuses were almost nothing. At 2 years I was making the same as the employees who had been there for over 20 years. No matter how hard you worked or how little you worked, everyone recieved the same raise. You only get 4 to 5 days off a year and there was no holiday pay."
good,"This field is very competitive, and the days on the road are long. But when a contract is signed, it's very fulfilling. Air Products is like many other large companies; there are positives and negatives to being a small fish in a big pond."
good,"Was fast-paced, challenging work but with great people of diverse backgrounds and cultures making for a very educational experience and good overall work environment."
good,AP is going through a lot of restructuring and downsizing as part of cost reduction efforts. It's a relaxed place to work at with a good work ethic but morale is low due to these recent cuts.
good,"sécurite , qualité , objectif , production."
good,"I enjoyed keeping my equipment and my plant running efficiently. I also enjoyed training operator to work outside and on the board. Because the company is letting employee go, people are worry more about their future."
good,"Good place to begin you career and very safe place to work at. Typical day is daily logs, making rounds ensuring equipment is operating within acceptable parameters. Also helping load trailers if the drivers are having trouble, Maintain the process within acceptable parameters."
good,Rewarding job with the ability to grow and become better both in the job at hand and within the company. Day to day duties were unique and challenging.
good,"Overall good job/life balance, decent pay, good benefits.  Overall good company to work for, but no real job security.  They sold off a large portion of the company, which makes it much more difficult."
good,"This could be a really great place to work if upper management would wake up and notice the immense red flag flying above the La Porte site. 10+ operators left before me and 3 after. Most sharing the same thing in common. Lead operator should not be running a lemonade stand, let alone a multi million dollar hydrogen / carbon monoxide facility. At what point is one more valuable than 13? Knowledge is valuable, but if you are in a position of leadership and incapable of conducting yourself in a professional manner, you shouldn't be in a position of leadership. "
good,"I've enjoyed working for Air Products - very helpful managers and co-workers. However, the company is currently going through a lot of change and there is high turnover."
good,"Continued operations held sway over most everything, with exception of Safety.  Equipment condition was generally below average to poor.  Required Maintenance OT almost every night."
good,diverse culture  and management styles . Pilot  plant support and cycle time development ; material development for Adsorption
good,"Being an Office Clerk would involve Data input, printing, word processing and faxing.  The hardest part of the job was the training"
good,Learned how to build chemical distibution machines from start to finish.
good,My position is a very pressurised position with long hours. I have learnt to work on jde. I enjoy the interaction with management and technicians on a daily basis.
good,"Productive and fun workplace with great people and room for advancement. "
good,"Depending on the business area you're in will directly affect your ability to advance in your career.  Company's culture still struggles to avoid unconscious bias towards women, people of color and those without a STEM degree."
good,"I enjoyed working at Air Products up until the time my job was eliminated.  The coworkers are great and the atmosphere is generally good.  The problem there currently is new management that is cutting people for the sake of cuts,  There is too much of a focus on the stock price and not enough on the work the employees actually do.  I did enjoy my time while I was there and would definitely go back, xsince I suspect this is true of most corporations."
good,"A majority of the employees have been there for a while so it will take you some time to climb the ladder. If you stay patient, you will reap the fruits of your labor."
good,Good place to get your feet wet and start a career. No one really hangs around for the long haul though. A lot of turnover. They do have a lot more attention to detail than most industrial gas companies so that is a plus.
good,"Old plant, with lots of old technology and equipment. On-call every other week/weekend. Have to live within 30 minutes to respond to plant alarms and shutdowns. Hard to do anything outside of work because of the constant reminder that the plant is unreliable and will call you out at all hours of the night. Stressful for your family when you are getting called out in the middle of the night, every night."
good,"good employer who develops you within the company, all staff members have been there a long time, its the kind of job people stay for their careers .."
good,"A relaxed environment punctuated by moments of panic when the process fails. The company is going thru a growing phase, with new equipment being added and new orders expected."
good,Air Product's is a great company. I've learned a lot working at Air Product's a very stable company. Long work hour 12 to 14 hour days and sometime you may have to go into your 16 hour rule but not often.

I enjoy the folks I work with, there are talented and hardworking for the most part. The job is providing H2, steam and power to the Valero facility. Its a 24 / 7 operation in which I am on call for day and night. I enjoy the training aspect of the job, taking new operators and provideing them with the tools and guidance they need to learn the process and become a productive member of the team."
good,"Very good place to perform your work activites, management (depeartment) very understanding and cooperative in not over burdening employee with work; though more emphasis on development of spcific skills related to engineering can be perofrmed. "

good,"overall, working at Air Products, I had learnt a lot from my manager."
good,"While most of Air Products is an established supplier of bulk chemical and gasses, they do have division concentrated on growth within the semiconductor equipment field.  This offers many opportunities to work on various development projects from the concept phase through prototyping.  The environment is friendly and collaborative.  There is a bit of established procedures that can seem to impede progress but are there to insure quality and consistency.  Overall it is a good place to work however due to the cyclical nature of the industry projects are not guarantied so you will constantly be looking for the next project or opportunity within the company."
good,"Productive and fun workplace with great people and room for advancement. "
good,I am able to adjust my schedule for each week. flexible and relaxed environment.
good,Great place to work with supportive management. Career position with many different fields to work. Gas and Chemical management is a great field.

good,"Managed different chemical systems, as well as lab help."
good,"Hard work"
good,most enjoyable part of my job is the interaction with all groups in the business.  love to keep busy and no day is ever the same.  management is lacking and information is not freely shared.
good,"A empresa oferece ótimos benefícios e salário compatível com o mercado. Em contrapartida, não possui plano de carreira, e promoções e aumento de salário por desempenho/mérito são bastante difíceis e raros."
good,"For a privately owned company, Air Products does provide a good salary and excellent benefits.  However, management is rather split with each manager doing their own thing and their is no consistency in expected job performance.  There are often favorites who can get away with anything and others that are consistently harrassed.  Until they get a consistent policy on expected job performance, be careful with this company."
good,"Productive and fun workplace with great people and room for advancement. "
good,Benefits will take care of your family. Overall you can have a good adult paying job with mostly professional people. Make a decision based on family care instead of happiness.

good,The colleagues are a huge benefit; highly talented and smart individuals all working together to deliver results both to customers and to the company.

good,"Productive and fun workplace with great people and room for advancement. "
good,"très bonne équipe au sein de mon service, un vrai plaisir de travailler dans ces conditions"
good,The plant required monthly maintenance and many startups and shutdowns during my time there. Each one had its own trouble starting up and shutting down respectively and learning was always on the daily task list. Safety is taken very seriously around the plant. The plant itself has a very clean environment as far as plants go.
good,Loaded trucks with carbon dioxide and delivered to customers.  Co-workers were great to work with.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with upper management.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the job itself.
good,"industrial gas company, balance between work and life, engineer analysis, design and development, located in Allentown"

good,"My limited intern experience exposed me to a great working environment, friendly staff, throughout safety training and very organized training on instruments. Presentation upon research progress engaged me to a good group discussion."

good,Solid career with chance to work in many different areas and with many different people.  I started in Accounting right out of college and then the company paid for me to go for my Masters degree on a part time basis.  I then moved into the finance department followed by working directly in the North America business area
good,All of my co-workers are great to be around this makes the day to day work a great atmosphere.  This is a direct reflection of upper management and their managerial direction.
good,"Enjoyed the company and close knit atmosphere.  However, it is slowly changing(typical of most companies).  Still a decent company to begin career for chemical engineers or finance majors."
good,"Productive and fun workplace with great people and room for advancement. "

good,"Great corporate culture, gives young engineers opportunities to learn and succeed. Great career development program."

good,"Good place to work,paid well,enjoyable people.Fun times."
good,"APCI is a great company. It is very large, and it is but hard to advance there without managment mentor."
good,"I was a contractor at the semi conductor production division for 1.5 years. I had a good time working there, met great people and got to learn valuable new skills. I'm not sure if that division is still part of the company or not. The higher up corporation seemed pretty normal, like any other."
good,"Empresa en crecimiento, permite el crecimiento en profesional en la áreas de calidad y seguridad."
good,"Air Products was an aggressive, paternalistic, demanding organization in the 80's.  It changed over the course of my employment to become a bureaucratic nightmare.  HR began to run the organization and group think became the norm.  Questioning the culture or the direction the culture was going was forbidden.  I took early retirement to get out of it.  As one person said to a friend of mine about my leaving the company, ""Well, you can't keep telling the emperor that he has no clothes on and expect to survive."""
good,"This was a good entry level sales roll. Taught skills in cold calling, as well as becoming resilient. The advancement opportunities were limited though in the sales positions."
good,"long days, good variety of types of work, many opportunities, varying degrees of management capability, a lot of talented hardworking people, good pay and benefits,"
good,"Challenging work, but the team culture in the company is great, Always something new to learn. The company prides itself on its safety culture and it holds true."
good,The company was very safety oriented and I found it also very clean place to work. The balance of home and work life was always taken into consideration.
good,If you like long hours this is the place for you...you start at 8:00 am and I have stayed out til 9:30 pm it’s crazy there not concerned if you are dead tired they expect you to be there and do the job no matter what... it’s a very rewarding job when you go to patients homes and set up there medical equipment or concentrators and you see the smile on there faces knowing you are there to help them be comfortable and feel better...  the only real problem with this job is the long hours !
good,Great Experience in Process Plant Environment.  Lots of opportunities to gain experience in Field of Study as well as network into other Fields of Study
good,"Productive and fun workplace with great people and room for advancement. "
good,"It was a good company to work for. Got my start in the Cryogenics industry and stayed in it for 30 years. Learned the operations of large Air separation plants. Management overall was good. The hardest part of the job was definatly the shift work. Working graveyard one week, then day shift one week, then swing and back to graveyard."
good,I was in a small technical group where deadlines were tight and we were constantly understaffed. Treated us like a big manufacturing facility to the point where we did more paperwork than actual work.
good,work details are very specific.  strict guidelines and procedures.  leadership is very close by to ensure safety and efficiency.  coworker are trained and willing to assist.
good,Management treated employees fairly.  Workplace culture could be qlueckish at times.  The hardest part of the job was that it was a 24/7 operation and you were required to work holidays.
good,Highly recommended for young individual to gain experience in different work fields.The management was slightly strict but also very friendly and they were also very helpful to your needs.
good,"Monitor process equipment and understanding plant drawings,flow rates. Management has been very involved in operations. Culture is good and hardest part of job is shutting down plant, enjoyable part is safe working man hours."
good,A typical day at work was working with hazardous bulk chemicals/gases while in PPE gear.  Learned alot more about safety because of the bulk chemicals/gases.  Management was awesome.  Very hands on when needed.  The workplace culture dealt mainly around safety due to chemicals/gases.
good,Air Products offers a wide selection of benefits for the employees to choose from.  The people are great to work with.  There are opportunities to grow within company both at headquarters as well in the field.
good,Overall a decent place to work with many good people employed there.  I really appreciated my time at this company and am glad that I got to make friends for life.
good,"Morning safety meet. "
good,Great work environment!The management could do a bit better job but overall they are keeping it together. Big layoffs not that good for job security. But if you think you can make the cut it is an exceptional place to work.
good,"Air Products has  a great staff and very good people to work with. However, in recent years with the change of the upper management, the company is not the same as when I joined. Enjoyed my time with the company."
good,"Training coordinator, update procedures, SAP GUI Requisition,  AP Direct Buyer, spreadsheets for different projects, event planner, Liaison for local Chamber of Commerce,  National Night Out.  "
good,"Foi uma grande experiência profissional para minha carreira, uma boa empresa para trabalhar, salários e benefícios acima da média,   ambiente de trabalha não muito amigável ou descontraído."
good,"The project was always a very short term time scale."
good,Financially stable company. Methodical decision making.
good,"Once it is a very secured place (the company has been around for over 70 years), there is not much creativity needed. Moving up the career ladder seems like a very long process. Not feeling the need to improve."
good,"Productive and fun workplace with great people and room for advancement. "
good,"Everyday starts out with safety meeting, streches and excersice. We go through the work orders and go out and fix replace or repair what is on our tasks for the day. We all work as teams and mostly everyone gets along very well."
good,"The company is very slow, moving in all directions but with no magnitude. Needs to focus added value decision making and re structure the decision making process."
good,"Todo dia existia um desafio novo a realizar, os objetivos sempre foram claros, aumento de produtividade e corte de custos, acima de tudo e antes trabalhar com segurança e promover a segurança entre todos. estes foram os combustíveis para  me manter focado e desafiado. O ambiente de trabalho sempre foi o mais amigável possível, pois as tarefas eram estressantes, pois tínhamos que alem dos desafios internos diários, existia o desafio que o transportador nos colocava (quebra de equipamento, falta de motoristas, informações desencontradas) troca de funcionários constante da transportadora gerava uma falta de conhecimento, tínhamos que sempre explicar detalhadamente o que a empresa esperava do  nível de prestação de serviço. A parte mais difícil foi lidar com o prestador de serviço e a cobrança dos meus superiores sempre buscando corte de custos e a alta performance nos meus indicadores, contudo como disse no começo, gosto de trabalhar com foco em objetivos e isto me motivava a sempre apresentar o melhor trabalho a cada dia."
good,"Transferred huge complex data from XML to and from SQL Server through SQL procedures."
good,Great place to work. Recently changed management for the better. Good atmosphere and great benefits. Insurance is fantastic and profit sharing every year.
good,Productive workplace with competent and collaborative team.  Sold career development programs with opportunities to move up and build new skills.  Very structured and focused work culture.
good,Air Products is a great company to work. Very safety oriented company. There are some really great people who do the right thing for the company and employee.
good,"In order to reach financial goals, Air Products has restructured in recent years.  In many cases this has been a boon to the company, and has indeed improved overall profitability.  However, in the most recent FY, staffing in some locations has become so thin that the workloads are becoming overwhelming."
good,The people at Air Products are incredible and care about each other. Meanwhile the upper management makes decisions that do not seem to factor in employees. They seemingly only care about financial results and what investors/customers care about.
good,Air products was my first job after the military. I enjoyed working there until a certain manager came into the picture. the entire culture changed and for that reason only I made a personal decision to leave.
good,This is a good company. The benefits are outstanding. The workload can be unbalanced. Hard and heavy for a few years and then things can slow down dramatically.
good,The days were packed with activity. At times it can be stressful. There is a lot of support from co-workers. But the customer could be demanding at times.
good,"temp assignment"
good,"Very good company to work and the employees are very frendly and helpfull ,,"
good,I really enjoyed working for Airproducts. The atmosphere was great .. most days were fantastic. The shop floor supervisors were for the most part very knowledgeable
good,"Productive and fun workplace with great people and room for advancement. "
good,"Not sure how it is now. it's been a while since i've been there. But, when i was there it was a good company to be with. The pay was ok, but it could be better."
good,"Fast pace, constantly evolving workplace that pays dividend to learning new skill sets. It lends plenty of opportunities for coaching and providing guidance to other employees."
good,it has been several years since i have worked for the company and i don't feel comfortable writing a review but cant seem to get past this page
good,"Mi trabajo era la gestión de archivos de concursos y adjudicaciones y proceder a la reclamación de avales a los diferentes organismos."
good,"The company is quite good, but has a poor work/life balance. The benefits are very good and management is generally very good."
good,"The peeople I work with I fun, open minded. I have learned to do collections and have a feel of some part of accounting. Managment are not transparent and act a bit inappropriate manner. My co-workers are fun, can be petty at times, but we all are but human and we all are different. The hardest par of my job is obtaining money from a Key customer, whom we cannot place the account on hold. The most enjoyable part of my job is providing customer service, travelling (getting to see new places) and meeting my customers and new people."
good,"very demanding, good group of people, good wages, 12 hour days, learned how to plan/schedule transportation routes/deliveries"
good,"Designing, configuring, testing and troubleshooting network security systems (Firewalls/IPS/VPNs)"
good,"I was given an opportunity that normally wasn't available for entry level chemists. My work includes clean room and ICPMS, method development, customer audits, R&D, SOP's/MOC's and programming."
good,"I typically balance a few projects at once and can work on each of them for a portion of each day. I've learned how to effective communicate with others at all experience levels to ensure we all can work together as a productive team. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with engineers of all discplines and backgrounds. In my position, I see how the diverse team works together on a common goal. It also is apparent how those differences in opinion and engineering backgrounds adds value to the end goal too."
good,"Lots of it."
good,Air Products was a great move for me and my career. Management showed so much care for their employees. Air Products safety culture is second to none. Air Products wants everyone looking out for each other while working and encouraged all to buy in to this culture which makes it such a great place to work.
good,Great place to work.  People are the main reason for success. Unfortunate situation due to restructuring - selling off businesses/reduction in workforce and diversity of offerings but company is now refocused and successful in industrial gases - as was the original focus of the company.
good,It was a nice place to work but it was a LONG time ago so maybe I should not be rating this company?  But it's on the list so I have to type something.
good,chaleureux très pro management digne des grandes entreprises.
good,"Overall Air Products offers a reasonable employment package.  The environment within the company is very nice, however as in all companies, there are a few undesirables that need to be worked with as well."
good,"Productive and fun workplace with great people and room for advancement. "
good,"Bonne société malgré une divergence de point de vue, équipe de maintenance agréable et ouverte a l'evolution"
good,A typical day at work was washing tractor trailers and helping with various tasks around the plant. You are exposed to outside conditions and it can get very cold in the wash bay during winter. Management was awesome and were very friendly. I learned a lot about maintenance. What I enjoyed the most was that I got to work on a lot of different projects there.
good,Overall a good company to work for. Associates benefits and pay are above average. Pleasant work environment with friendly co-workers. Good work hours with optional overtime.
good,"I've been with the company for 3 years now. The first 6 months was probably the hardest with getting into my own routine. In that time I also became a Driver Mentor and train all new hires. Since then this has been the easiest job I have ever had. There have been ups and downs, weeks I've worked 60 plus hours and weeks I barely got 40, that is the nature of the beast, but I'm guaranteed a 40 hour check. The loads are repetitive but at least you get to know the customer and know where you are going, I average between 1200 and 1600 miles a week, with virtually no wait time for load or unload. Logistics can sometimes be stressful, however they are willing to work with you, if you need an early day and give them enough notice they try to work with you on it.  For me this is a great company to work for, they offer room for advancement, it's a little harder as a driver but it is there."
good,Good Company to work. Very relaxed environment. Very helpful people. Good salary and benefits. Very strict on security and safe environment work place.
good,"Good job for a truck driver with daily home time.  Work is easy just takes some time to learn.  Must have three years experience, Hazmat and tanker endorsement."
good,"Company has solid benefits and co workers are top notch.  However, the compensation & work lift balance for the effort put in needs revamping.  Upper management is way out of touch."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Air Products, and it is unfortunate that my employment had to come to an abrupt ending due to the company closing the site."
good,Overall a good company to work for and is better positioned since latest changes but still a long way to go with less resources to get there.
good,"Empresa idônea, cumpre com todas as suas obrigações fiscais, legais e ambientais."
good,"Provided customers with temporary supplies of hydrogen, nitrogen, argon, and oxygen.  Provided high pressure pumping equipment to the metro chemical industry."
good,Zeer fijne werkgever met uitmuntende collega's. Met pijn in mijn hart helaas door een kosten reorganisatie na 18 jaar niet meer werkzaam. Denk nog steeds elke dag met plezier terug naar hele mooie tijden. Zeer veel geleerd over mezelf en een mooie persoonlijke groei doorgemaakt. Kan hier uren doorschrijven maar als dit niet duidelijk is mis je een geweldige werkgever
good,Politica de portas abertas para todos os funcionários. Aplica e desenvolve processos modernos de administração. Bom ambiente de trabalho. Equilíbrio entre trabalho e vida pessoal um pouco prejudicado pela necessidade de apresentar resultados constantemente.
good,"This company is very stable, but moving to JHB north, which I cannot affort to work at."
good,"I spent 5.5 years at Air Products and during that time gained valuable experience in Financial Planning and Analysis.  The FP&A area is large enough that there are plenty of diverse opportunities.  However, one of the reasons that I left and that many of my peers did was because there is little room for advancement.  Air Products is one of the largest employers in the Allentown/Bethlehem area and such, people don't tend to leave.  As a result the ranks are clogged at the top with older personnel and in order to advance it can be quite a long wait.  "
good,Air Products has a lot of good benefits and care for thier employees.
good,"Productive and fun workplace with great people and room for advancement. "
good,"Good place to work, good training program in place. Long hours running team, but good pay while doing so. Not much chance to advance if you're a driver, they want to keep you in place as a driver."
good,"Ging met plezier naar het werk, flexibele werkgever."
good,"My time at apci as an employee was enjoyable. Management was fair in my opinion. Travel can be a bit excessive, however this is the nature of the industrial gas business. As with all the other major industrial gas companies, to advance within the organization, a willingness to relocate is a must."
good,"Empresa em grande expansão no Brasil e está focada no crescimento. Suas ultimas aquisição na América Latina vem demonstrando a sua necessidade de avanço no mercado, e vem trabalhando no mesmo sentido no Brasil."
good,"Nice and helpful colleagues, good work environment, great career possibilities"
good,"Processed warranty claims"
good,"Good to work for"
good,"It was nice  working for Air Products. Multi-cultural, Fun, lovely colleagues"
good,Air Products is a great place to work. Provided my career development skills across a wide variety of functions. Paid fairly. still own the company's stock and as a retiree can still use their gym
good,on a days work you drive to custemirs deliver the sylinders and replys emty one whit fulle one and then the day just go on. i have a great time working at airproducts
good,Air Products is a great place to learn about a fascinating industry that supports many products and services. The level of professionalism and collaboration among employees is hard to beat anywhere.
good,"After a 28 year career with Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., the ""and Chemicals"" portion was divested; the Electronics Division was spun off as Versum Materials (late 2016) and the Performance Materials Division was sold to Evonik Industries (Jan 2017).  To be fair, the decision to divest ""...and Chemicals"" was absolutely in the best interest of APD's share holders and placed the Electronics and Performance Materials Divisions with their ""highest value owners.""  More than a year later, I can respect APD and its leadership's decisions even though the negative impact on the people in my division and me, personally, was not insubstantial.  All of that said, the Air Products I spent the vast majority of my career with was a truly Great Place to Work.  The culture was driven by the need to be highly competitive in highly competitive markets, and that drove our management (at all levels) to continually ask the right questions and demand the best.  We worked HARD, but we collaborated and leveraged each others' strengths, and every individual knew that they were heard and made a difference.  The skills that my colleagues and I developed were world class.  Our accomplishments were also world class. It is not possible for me to judge the Air Products of today.  But if they focus on fact-based decision making with the best interests of the business as their primary (and those of their customers as the close secondary) measures, they should do well."
good,learned a lot from more experienced employees was a great experience. It was nice not going to work and hating my job it was more than a typical day at work.
good,"Air Products is one of the few industrial gas companies not headquartered in the gulf coast.  Because of that, they know they have an oasis where permanent employees are subject to the tide of the company.  It used to be a company where upper management took care of their employees, but it is becoming more and more competitive without adequate compensation.  Everyone you work with is generally very friendly.  AP is full of employees who are generally very kind.  Compared to other engineering companies, they are more considerate.  There is not much diversity at this company, so if you are young but not white/male engineer, it will be harder for you to integrate fully and have people listen to your opinions and voice your concerns.  They are trying to work on the diversity issue, but cultural changes like that are slow for big companies."
good,Work culture: high focus on safety puts employees first in almost everything. It is nice to work here. A real multi cultural and multinational company.
good,"Working at Air Products was a blessing.  The workplace culture was really relaxed.  They had many choices for health insurances, had a fitness center on site.  They made it convenient for all of your needs.  I would recommend anyone work at Air Products."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at APCI.  The management knew where it was headed and provided the latitude for us to get it done.  Along with leadership, my peers appeared to be invested in the role they had and were passionate about the science."
good,"Productive and fun workplace with great people and room for advancement. "
good,A great company to work for they celebrate their employees as well as have great job advancement opportunities. The downside of this company is that they do not pay well
good,Enjoy the wide range of clients we can touch! Every day is different and exciting! Air Products offers exceptional service and a knowledgeable experts.
good,Always working fixing things if job is done for today before time is up they will put you helpinhg other people good work environment not good for people that cant handle the heat

good,"Both employees and management are great, they are always looking for ways to improve the work load and environment, I would recommend Air Products to anyone looking for a great place to work."

good,"Productive and fun workplace with great people and room for advancement. "
good,"Air Products is a great company in a great industry. I enjoy working with this company, however they need to train their employees more effectively. The managers are all top-notch and will work hard to make sure their sales people are successful.
