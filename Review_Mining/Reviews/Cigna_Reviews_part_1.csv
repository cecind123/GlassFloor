rating,review
bad,"This was by far the worst job I've had. Cigna HealthSpring was, I don't know about regular Cigna. The leadership ignores you for hours when you ask for help. The supervisors are not very friendly. They don't have ANY benefits. Just don't waste your time applying."
bad,Cigna has no regard for their members! They won’t pay claims. Management talks badly about employees and I truly feel like management is racist! I’ve sat in meetings and heard the most horrible things being said about employees.
bad,"After being a very competent, hardworking employee, I was illegally let go after battling for nearly two years with them for any part time disability  compensation. Now  I am on full time disability, partly because of their blatant neglect."
bad,"Cigna has a culture of chaotic bureaucracy.   They are terrible at making decisions and they treat their employees like mindless drones.  If you aspire to have a fulfilling career, try a different company in a different industry."
bad,"This is the worst job I ever had, too much information to learn in a short amount of time. All supervisors were not knowledgeable. The only plus about this job is the option to work at home if you qualify."
bad,"The promise of work at home, as wonderful as this will end up being your golden handcuffs. You will be overworked, micromanaged and underpaid. Your every moved is tracked. "
bad,"I became sick and 10 years of loyalty didnt mean a thing. 3 months before I got sick, my yearly review was 4.9 out of 5. Management changed and the next thing I knew, i was fired for something trivial within 6 months of my return."
bad,"Main focus point is to achieve daily case goal with as few coverage determinations approvals as possible. Virtual training was subpar by pharmacists that ""have not actually worked cases in 1.5 years"" ( Ifeoms A)"
bad,"Cigna is a large corporation worth several million dollars, however, they treat staff like a number. They do not respect their employees. Management is looking out for themselves and not their staff."
bad,"Terrible place to work. want to be the best in the business but are nowhere near. Good ideas in principle but don’t have the systems, platforms or IT staff capable of delivering the services they promise such as member portal, client portal, virtual health app but still went ahead and put them in production anyway. Everyday is another problem another complaint & another day of stress. Take a day off and you’re scrutinised for it. You’re not allowed to be sick. Joke of a company."
bad,I would not recommend it. Not in the lafayette or Connecticut region. They work you like a dog and do not value your input. If you are too opinionated they will find a way to let you go basically working for them means you must be a YES MAN!
bad,very stressful very stressfull very stressful. most jobs going off shore to India including HR. work sent off shore work sent off shore. For this site i have to add more so just writing so it will take the information given.
bad,Horrible place to work. My supervisor tried to fire me for a no no show on my scheduled day off! Wrongful termination case in which I won! They also violated FMLA rules and regulations.
bad,They want you to be perfect and they pick on you constantly if you don't. They pay low wages but the work demand is very high and the turned around of people quitting is even worse. Very unfriendly rude people.
bad,Management doesn’t care about the employees and lie to make themselves look better. When you have a question you rarely get an answer.  Management is too busy to get help for the employees.  It’s like being fed to the wolves.
bad,"No room for advancement within departments. Management is very ""self-centered"". There is A LOT of favoritism from upper management. They say they advocate for work-life balance, but if you are not a ""favorite"" you basically get what's leftover. No immediate supervisor support. There is A LOT of ""throwing under the bus"" mentality. Bonuses are not spread out fairly, it is left up to the immediate supervisor who they ""feel"" should get the bonuses for the year. It is not split amongst the entire team. So the same ppl get bonuses every year. They have a lot of deceitful and unknowledgeable practices and when caught, they blame the workers for not doing their jobs correctly. Too much ambiguity and not a happy work environment."
bad,"Cigna promises a great deal but it never happens.  Goals are ok but you have little support in the field.  You are on your own to succeed or fail.  When you succeed, the bar is moved and promises are not kept.  They also expect you to work 60+ hours a week including weekends, however, they only pay you an hourly wage for 40 hours a week, no overtime.  I'm not even sure that is legal but they do it."
bad,"Pathetic!!!!!  How can you people look at yourselves, in the mirror, knowing how dishonest you have been?!? Shame on each one of you!!!  For you Supervisors, Team Leads, and coerced Trainer, in the Medicare Customer Svc Dept, in Bedford, TX, bad, bad, bad business....to lie, backstab your own new employees, play cut-throat games with your own co-workers/employees, and act SO cunning  & deceitful"
bad,"I wouldnt recomend this place of  work to anyone. The job is Stressful, the amount of time they put in for training is slim and then expect you to figure it out once you get on the floor. Managers play favorites and are not there for employees."
bad,"unless you are young, college degree stay away from this company!  the pay is horrible unless you are part of the pack with your manager,  you will not get a good raise and they will belittle you!   the benefits are horrible and you are better off being on welfare!"
bad,Terrible company who treats employee’s very poor all they talk about is firing you and if your numbers are not good termination. The management is very poor and I would not recommend to anyone.
bad,The worst experience in my life.  They micromanage to a point that is unbelievable.  No one in the company knows how to make a decision.  The expectations are impossible.  I can guarantee the so called management could not even come close to doing what they demand of the staff.
bad,"Survey  should include a zero and below. Hired for a position which turned into 3 to 5 postions and no training. Is unacceptable in my book. Created my own to help others. My health issues and side affects from medication were used against me. My manager was a joke. Weekly calls were her own  personal agenda, no direction and support. Senior management took absolutely NO excuses and managed by intimidation. EXTREMELY non compliant and may have made me a threat. Fired by senior management"
bad,"The manager is VERY partial, uneducated and only looks after her kind. Poorly managed production working environment. The manager has been reported to Ethics countless times and Cigna has done NOTHING about it. The manager only approved for 2.5 people off at a time so you’re forced to take unscheduled Pto. This place is horrible."
bad,This job is stressful. The management does not know how to do the jobs they assign and then sets unrealistic expectations of you. The workload and the stress is not worth the pay. My manager was rude and even called me stupid and slow when I had trouble keeping up with my tasks.
bad,"I worked for Cigna 9years. Always gave my best, top employee on my team. But one hateful person that was not my supervisor had the control to end my career because she hated the fact I was moving on. The sad part is that upper management allowed her to do as she pleased.  Don’t waste your life working for this company."
bad,"Very poor management, not enough employees to handle the work load during there peak season. Would never recommend this company. I have to keep writing until I reach 150 charters."
bad,Extremely high call volume that can range up to 300 or more calls per day. Supervisors are laid back and don’t interact much at all with employees. Sedentary work level that is extremely tiring and involves you to use too many spreadsheets and systems to complete one task.
bad,Many of the employees are underpaid for the jobs that they perform. They are not given enough feedback and are limited in their work. There are not many chances for advancing your role or opportunities to transfer to another department. The shifts are a bid basis and not all employees are able to have the same volume based on a present shift to show optimal results.
bad,"IT directors, principals, and managers they all came from Bloomberg. they just promote themselves and hire from their relatives, and friends who have zero related experience for the job. They keep raising their salary, and give bonus and promotion to themselves. They outsource the job and hire contractors instead of using their our skilled professional. All professional in IT department have left due to lack of professionalism and knowledge! The rate of turn over is very high. So many useless meetings and no work/life balance at all."
bad,"I currently like the job and the pay, But the culture here is not one that works for me, I know a few people in a few departments the feel that management does care or even know what they do on a day to day basis."
bad,Facets is the department I worked in and it is terrible--they do not even want to work with me to give me time to go to my sons dr appointments and he is disabled. They do not give raises and they are always increasing our responsibilities and numbers without giving any equitable raises. Be prepared to put Cigna above everything and everyone even your own children--b/c they do not care about anything else you may have going on even if it is documented. You are there for them. There is NO work/life balance.  If you are not prepared for Cigna to do be your one and only priority do not work here.
bad,"Cigna is a stagnant, silo managed multi-billion dollar organization. The culture is dysfunctional if not toxic.  I observe it more so in the Denison location than others. Cigna has a bad reputation within the community and is known by the majority within the community to not be “pro-employee”. FMLA is abused by employees to avoid being penalized for taking care of themselves and/or families."
bad,"Work environment was very competitive, goals and metrics were impractical and help or training was unavailable.  Next to impossible to succeed, unless quality was compromised to meet production  goals.  Structure was unorganized and lack of communication throughout company."
bad,Management was not knowledgeable about the overall aspects of the job.  One manager in particular would ask her staff for answers to questions or tell employees to ask someone else for answers. The TC's were knowledgeable.  The position seemed geared more towards quantity of calls rather the the quality of the calls. The medical benefits were not beneficial to the employees.  I would not recommend anyone to work there unless the company made changes in how they treat their employees.
bad,goals and productivity are impossible to be met. work life balance is impossible.  there are clicks in management and they back each other up at all times.  many group members went on leave for stress alone.
bad,The mangers arent willing to work with the employees.There is alot of stress that comes along with any department. The leads arent held accountable for their actions.
bad,This company did not care for you individually.  They were all about numbers and were not easy to work with regarding your needs if there were personal issues.
bad,"Do yourself a favor and don't bother. I have been with the company for 4 years and am currently trying to find my way out. They DO NOT care about their employees. If you want to move around it's all about WHO you know and not WHAT you know. They have the highest expectations and the compensation does not match the workload. The training is non existent. Management is horrible, i have been in 3 depts and they are all the same."
bad,"Cigna in and of itself may be a good company to work for.  Conduent is the company Cigna contracted with for their mail room operations.  On any given day you could be there for 8 hours or less, however more often than not you were required to work a minimum of 8 hours even though as a production based job/pay, employees were supposed to be allowed to leave once work was completed.  During the ""busy"" time of the year, an employee would work anywhere from 10-18 hours.  There is no communication between managers or team leads or from the 1st shift teams to 2nd shift teams.  Favoritism plays a large role in how employees are treated and complaints are basically ignored and put off.  There is opportunity to make good money IF you can make production and be allowed to do the job you're hired in for instead of being pulled off to do busy work on a job that has a lower production pay rate."
bad,"The management at this company is horrible, they are always on your case about being off the phones no matter what. The call center side of Cigna is always understaffed, you will not get a break from the phones once you   start your shift."
bad,"no words can express the level of stress that one will receive while "
bad,Never consider this place. Worst management of any company I have ever worked. Team never delivered a single project due to changing priorities and inability of 'managers' to manage up.
bad,"Work day starts off by being told what to work and how to work specific pharmacy orders. "
bad,I don't have nothing to say about Cigna they want you to follow policy but yet don't follow it them selves! I would never go back to Cigna! Have no empathy in regard to you or what's going on with you or your family!
bad,horrible and depressing place of business to work for. the staff are in clicks and if you are not to their liking you will not have room for advancement.  Your work ethics are overlooked.
bad,"I worked in the contracting department 4 years. My original manager quit after having her first child. A co worker was made manager. He never liked me so months later he found means to fire me. Management allows child like behavior. Only promoted if you are in the ""clique"". Very cut throat and biased. I feel like I wasted 4 years of my life for over priced insurance. There are better jobs out there!"
bad,"The training was very long and the pay for very low, and they expected you to do many jobs, the supervisors didn't even want to do their jobs. And the phone was always very busy."
bad,the pay is ok but that is where it ends. the health insurance is the worst I have ever had if you don't have a family and just care about the money you might do well here.
bad,to many people telling you what to do and no structure.  Everyone would throw you under the bus and then expect for you to just rebound with a smile on your face.  Fights on the floor yelling screaming and cussing it reminds me of high school
bad,Frequent layoffs; cut throat environment; poor management; manager favored certain people and those were the ones that got the job advancement; HR knew about these difficulties but did not make any changes
bad,the management sucks. everyone is a bunch of drunks because the job sucks so bad you have to drink to survive. everyone is out for themselves and they dont care about their employees
bad,too many demands from the company and expected employees to meet unreachable goals. very stressful work environment with a bad computer system and horrible management
bad,"incompetent supervisors who do not understand how insurance works."
bad,What a nightmare to work in that office. I wanted to die every single day!!! Horrible place to work with all those Witches. NEVER APPLY. NEVER APPLY!!
bad,"As is typical, the organization is under-staffed, however, the culture in the Bethlehem office is horrendous.  There is no respect for calendar appointments and meetings are regularly planned around management schedules with absolutely NO regard for associates' own scheduled work hours, meetings, or out off office appointments.  It is acceptable practice for people to arrive late (to the tune of 20 minutes) or blow off a meeting completely."
bad,Working for Cigna was definitely a challenge.  I was a temporary and I felt the environment was not a pleasant experience.  They expected more as a temporary than an actual Cigna employee.
bad,"I'm miserable every day. Stressed. Lack of work, life balance kills time with my child. The company is nothing like how I thought it would be. I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone."
bad,"The managers were good and knowledgeable. They have really good benefits. Cigna was stressful, and those surrounding your peers were not usually very helpful."
bad,"I was laid off from Cigna.  Instead of giving raises to their employess, they would rather lay you off and have temp. service employees work for them so they won't need to pay them a lot"
bad,No training and manager did not know how to manage . Onboarding was very difficult and no existence . Environment was not friendly or helpful. Best thing was casual wear
bad,"Just a dreadful place where you're little more than a walking robot, typing names into computers in some shape or form. The wages are poor, the management is the most incompetent you could ever come across, there's little security as contracts are ripped up to suit with no recourse, there's no progression unless you're a teacher's pet."
bad,"It was very stressful working there"
bad,cigna was great for the first until arrival of new manger and so many favors. everyone was treated differently and growth was hard due to everyone having a favor
bad,"This organization did not want to commit to changes. Plenty of lip service but at the end of the day it was about a cult of personality, not about process and practices that make the environment a challenging and rewarding place to work."
bad,I worked as a temporary employee.  At the time Cigna had a temporary pool.  They no longer have that at Cigna.  It eventually turned in to Adeco temporary employment.
bad,"Is Cigna still a place of employment, not sure about Cigna being a health care, that concentrate on insurance. They left the los Angeles area and moved to the south"
bad,"Poor Management and no career advancement and everyone for themselves mentality. Hired anyone to just fill seats, poor implementation of products and support"
bad,I liked my job  it was a fun workplace and the people that worked  was great to work around with graet attitude it was just a graet over all environment to work in
bad,The management system is a joke. They claim to be flexible and understanding but they have no empathy towards their employees. They want employees who's lives revolve around their call center.
bad,"Not enough time to do everything you are required to do case loads are way to high. CM are stressed to the max, they all want to go on a loa. use to be a great place to work."
bad,Did not like working for Cigna Very Stressful Work Environment. no employee Loyalty. employers often forget how valuable an employee is and that we are also human and deserve to be treat as such.
bad,"Management does not actually care about employees, just the bottom line and meeting numbers. Benefits are too expensive, especially for an insurance company to not provide affordable plans."
bad,"Absolute WORST employer.  Beyond cut-throat. It is a daily soap opera with trainers and married employees having affairs. It was beyond micro-managing to anyone who wasn't in the clique.  It was more like prison.  I would not recommend this employer to anyone. They live monitor your computer screen and no matter what you do right, they always find what you did wrong and focus on that."
bad,All about the numbers. Doesn't matter the customers situation. Cigna wants you to make numbers for them. Regardless if you complete the issue at hand with the caller.
bad,This company had too many rules and too many managers. They do not care about their employees and it is all about the numbers. You will burn out quickly.
bad,"extremely micromanaged, treats you like you are in high school. the specialty pharmacy is the worst, the supervisors are awful and no one listens to you to make things better."
bad,If you work here through a temp service you are a step child until you work for Cigna. Women that work here are vicious & will make you look bad or whatever they can do to sabotage the temps. Beware trust no one here!
bad,Bottom Line was the most important to the company.  They didn't care about their insured clients or employees.  Asked to do semi-unethical practices.  Would never recommend anyone work there
bad,Cigna is a growing company with lots of opportunities for movement. Fun place to work but very demanding to make sure the needs of our members are being met
bad,"the management is absolutely horrible, very micro managed, and it has a very young environment which means a lot of gossip and immature talk."
bad,Theres nothing good to say about this company.  Mgmt focus is on micro mananging employees.  No growth opportunity!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,"Mandated over time, mandated working holidays, point system if you don't work, point system for attendance, monitors that don't adjust, production work, it's all based on how much you can do in your 8hours. Medical benefits, some of the worst I've ever had, $200 every two weeks for two people, that are incredible bad!  Oh, did I mention they are under sanction with CMS they can't accept new members until that’s correct the issues. Well, I guess they have a group of blind people running the CMS action plain, because they still can't get it right. Inconsistent labor practices, the have a Corporate policy, but that doesn't mean anything since the regional manager can change things whenever she wants.  If you think your current job is bad, well come to Cigna, and you'll see how good you had it. Everyone is always looking to get it. They sell you the stars and sky, and paint a great picture, but when you get there you realize OH SH&&T I made a mistake."
bad,I was under the impression i was helping people with their nutritional needs but was exposed to owner and manger manipulating customer so they could gain monetary residuals and overall I had a bad experience in the end.
bad,I have seen plenty of people leaving the building on stretchers due to the stress of the job. They ran this place like a sweat shop and have had many lawsuits against them for their work practices. They loved to put fear in their employees about losing their jobs on a daily basis.
bad,"Cigna only cares about them selves, they did not want to help the customers at all, and they do not treat their employees well at all, they cared more about themselves and not they family of the employees."
bad,"The pay was decent, I would not recommend the job to anyone for the simple fact the allotted time the company requires you to spend with each customer is not enough time to properly help the customers. The job is very stress full since you are dealing with majority people who are already angry, then you have the unrealistic times your allotted to do complete situations with  customers properly, you are scored on the time it takes to do everything even go to the restroom. If you do not meet these goals you are terminated. Several people are terminated for this and there is a lot of turnaround for that reason. They demand you rush customers off the phone even if you have to cut them off, they do not care at all about customer service which is what I thought I was going to be providing, instead I had to constantly disappoint customers by rushing them, or risk not meeting my goals"
bad,"they require you to leave a review for every company you have worked for. I has to be very lengthy, otherwise you cant perform a job search and they make you leave more information."
bad,"Stressful environment. Mandatory overtime. Short staffed. Poor benefit packages. Unable to advance forward, backward or laterally. Management buries their head in the sand in a free-for-all environment. If you thrive in this kind of environment you'll love working for Cigna."
bad,"it used to be a fun workplace. However, there is no career development unless you have connection or wine and dine with your Manager."
bad,"I set up new accounts, problem solved, renewed prescriptions, placed new orders.   Tracked orders.  Helped patients with medications and pricing.  I took about 100 calls a day.  Management worked in Scranton, so we communicated via lynx.  "
bad,"crooked. horrible place to work. lies to customers. deceitful. "
bad,"Pretty sad to work for a company that has a $6000 deductible and you never are able to hit it, Also the do not follow ADA Federal Regulations!!! Worst company I have ever worked for... I spent more time being ill mentally because they never considered my rare illness an illness!! Abuse and harassment!!!!"
bad,"Bad Employer who lets people go at will to make room for the Anthem merger. They also don't promote from within."
bad,Qualcare is the worst company I have ever worked for! The employee turnover is ridiculous and the moral is unbelievably low. Unless you are desperate to get any job; I will urge you to go some place else for work.
bad,I would not refer people to work for Cigna. It is very stressful and they don't care about there staff at all.  The communications between workers and managers is absent.
bad,.really much to say. none of the management says hello. its just taking calls all day. YOU COME IN TAKE CALLS AND WILL BE FIRED IF YOU ARE LATE.
bad,Not only do you have to do patient care but you have to be the manager of the clinic. The management job requirements are ridiculous.
bad,"a typical day at work answering questioning about medical benefits, eligibility and claim status. "
bad,"I signed up to work with them as a contractor requiring me to take, pass and pay for a test out of my own pocket ($175). I followed through on all of my obligations and then they proceeded to change their policy and I was not reimbursed $175."
bad,"Upward mobility, healthcare benefits, and salaries are abysmal. Management acted as if they were part of a clan. African-American managers were ZERO at this particular office. It was also like pulling teeth to advance/transfer within. Their job culture definitely does not exemplify diversity whatsoever. If you are not a friend of a friend or a family member, forget about being hired at this location! Lots of nepotism! Lastly, after training people drop like flys. Healthcare benefits were so expensive, that they were not feasible for employees."
bad,The leaderships team and co-workers was so very mean to customers  and clients not to mention other employees.....There is nothing more I can say.. .
bad,routine down to walking into the door. management was interactive with co workers and co workers was fun to be around laughter never hurt anyone
bad,"Not only does the amount of work they expect form you not fit into an 8 hour work day, they expect you to get it done regardless even though they only offer overtime when it's the beginning of the year. On top of that, the people who have been there forever never seem to progress to a higher level of pay or a promotion yet the ones that know the bosses on the top of the hierarchy make it to the top fast and with little work to do- they have assistants to pour their junk on so they can dataset off whenever they Ike. That company is the most unfair place I ever worked for and they do not care about the amotional toll it takes on their employees when they are being screamed at all day. Instead of showing sympathy and helping, they just brought in a psychiatrist (no I'm not joking.) everyone is extendible and if you get a perfect eco view at the end of the year, start packing up your desk. THey WILL FIND  a reason to fire you and they WILLmake sure that reason is not allowed for unemployment to approve a claim for the employee, it's disgusting and I pray anthem does a heck of a better job than those half wits that ran the place prior"
bad,"I am seeking a busy, relaxed, multi level position. Lots of emails, calls with Clients, Brokers and Third Party Administrators."
bad,"If you work in Admin team, you are expected to be a robot.  Other teams I heard were better to work for, but the Admin team was a nightmare. Leadership very poor, you are not allowed to talk to the person next to you. Team Leader will not even bother to move to tell you this but will sit 2 desks away and send a cheeky email,  saying no talking during working hours.  Basic training, not introduced to anyone, just sit here and get on with it.  It was so bad that even after 3months I knew only 3 names out of a team of 18. "
bad,"best place ever you will love it , great place , great salary , flexible hours a lot of technology, you can grow very quickly, a lot of young people"
bad,"Was working there on contract assignment. Other temps acting as self appointed supervisors. there was no visible management of the department. if you are not part of the clique, you were not informed of what was going on. very heavy workload for the amount of money being paid. not a good work environment."
bad,"Nice job to gain experience with prior authorizations and learning about insurance such as medicade and medicare."
bad,"Obtain medical on behalf of the claim managers and claimants"
bad,I cleaned offices to earn money while going to college however not a long term career
bad,"Management will lie to you.  There is no HR department to complain to because all their HR needs are handled overseas.  They change your job without asking or giving notice.  "
bad,"Management is rarely around to manage. Because of that the on site leadership is poor and treats people poorly unless you are favored for random reasons that are selective and not always based upon performance. As a rule, there is no feedback and poor communication. Advancement is by ""last man standing"" and not based upon ability to manage others effectively. It is also not what you know but who you know. CIGNA is also using an overwhelming number of temporary workers to handle patient information and telephone inquiries instead of hiring direct employees. Health benefit coverage is some of the poorest health insurance coverage in the entire city as well as in the entire industry. They only offer HRA or HSA plans. I would recommend finding another company if for no other reason than the health insurance stinks and this is a health insurance company who could well afford to offer decent coverage to their employees. If you are married, make sure your spouse has a job with better coverage and take that. If you are single or a single parent, prepare to be poor if you have an illness that requires any significant amount of medical care. Time off is hard to get and the potential for advancement is nil. I started out excited and motivated ending up unchallenged and disillusioned."
bad,"Time management very important fast paced enviroment"
bad,This company is well established but the pay rate is very low. All the areas I learned during my time with this company was not enough.
bad,"benefits=substandard"
bad,"While I worked at Cigna I was consistently watched for productivity and micromanaged. I had to ask for time to go to the bathroom and explain if I went over my allotted time of 13 mintues per day. If I needed a day off I could be denied no matter the reason for the day. I also was told when I could eat lunch, when I had to be back and had to meet standards that were nearly impossible. Many people in my position have since moved on to other things or other departments. The managers would never be available to help when needed when dealing with a difficult member. Overall the personal advocates were under appreciated and overworked. We were viewed by health coaches as personal assistants not professionals as many of us held masters degrees in counseling, social work, psychology and some of us were even liscenced."
bad,"Review claims for company assigned to. Answer calls from call center and direct calls, answer client/customer calls, answer emails and complete tasks"
bad,"i would help the patients with there needs, i learned how to work in a pharnacy retail store. My management team was not supportive, they allowed other co workers yell at me. I loved being around the patients they new me and i knew them by first name basis."
bad,"No respect, or acknowledgement of accomplishments. Not a good company to work for."
bad,"typical day: sign into computer, opening email, check mailbox file for claims. Follow ups with collections calls "
bad,"Current employee, if it wasnt for the vacation days, i would have been gone a long time ago!    For such a large company that promotes work at jome, they sure do not follow through!  Managers that know noybing, playing on facebook all day, but when they feel like it, they work at home.   If you call off, expect the firing squad the next day!!  Worst company and ashame to work for them!  So.much bs and not proud to come to work, i see why half the staff takes mental break and goes out on STD!  Hmmmm, maybe join them"
bad,Not a good company to work for ... very bad experience!!  Would not refer any one to this company… 
bad,"the people that work at cigna are very rude and very catty, cigna was the worst place i have ever worked in my life."
bad,Cigna Home Delivery Pharmacy has a revolving door culture for employees and does not give alot to there employees even when you work so hard and get 100 percent in the metrics.
bad,One of the worst companies to work for. They show no employee appreciation...so happy I have found a better job.
bad,inbound call center claim processor
bad,This company is a joke. working there was like working a three ring circus.
bad,This job was high call volume call center this job was not for me.
bad,"I was a ""temp"" at the Pittsburgh location for almost 4 years before the decided to end my assignment for no apparent reason. I was never offered a full time job after applying for several openings which were given to friends or family members over qualified applicants. The management was changing all the time with no direction given to what was expected of you. This company only cares about profit over the way they treat their employees. I would not recommend working for them."
bad,"This company will say theres room to advance and theres not. My own manager doesn't even know most the workers names and he's on the same floor as us nor anything about ins. The sups only care about their numbers who has the best metrics not if the employees need help and if they did they wouldn't even know how to help anyways because none of them know how to use the systems (that barely work). Place is very micro managed. You get cussed out all day long on the phones and get timed when you use the bathroom and if youre too long you have a skype message waiting for you when you come back asking why arent you taking calls from people who arent even in the same state as you are. Theres no support and no one ever has the same answer to anything. everyone is pretty much guessing. The benefits suck! Only think decent is the pay for a call center yet you pay like $200 a check just for ins and you work them. "
bad,"Te venden la empresa como un sitio genial para crecer, humana y best place to work. Más bien worst porque te tratan como esclavo. Si no haces pelota tienes que pedir permiso hasta para ir al baño y no te permiten un solo descanso."
bad,"This is a glorified call center job . The training to prepare you for he job was so lacking in professionalism and quality, that you are constantly reaching out for help on a daily basis. All of this while you are trying to maintain unrealistic goals and numbers of calls , not to mention being put down for not knowing what you were never trained to do in the first place. No support from management, just the demand for better performance. Long hours , short scheduled breaks at unreasonable times."
bad,Training is great and everyone is knowledgeable n different aspects of the company. Great coworkers. Communication could be a lot better and needs improvement
bad,"This company has poor management  from direct management to the leadership team.  Very poor advancement opportunities. Job culture is toxic and morale is very poor.  My first week there I meet with my peers and lower level colleagues.  The interaction with my peer was unbelievably  and when I asked a question the response I received was  ""you figure it out,  nobody helped me"".  I let management know and they didn't care.  Very poor team environment."
bad,"more on hands training, allow employees to learn at their own pace,  better support once employee are done with training and begin to take calls. In nesting we should not have to hunt for assistance  or have to remove ourselves from the seat to flag someone down to assist us. ALL employees should be on the same pace even if tenure employees have to venture through more training. Let future employees know that this job is sink or swim."
bad,This place has horrible management and only promote friends and family members who are employed there. Managers are not hands on and the ones who have been there for years feel as if they dont need to work and delegate their duties to employees on their team. This is a horrible and stressful place to work. This is why the turn over is so high
bad,Upper management pays politics among team members. You don't have right to give your opinion or you should be out from Cigna that means just follow manager's order if it is right or wrong and they will kick you out new technologies come and hire new candidates but never give chance to existing employees who willing to learn new things.
bad,"As a former Senior Billing/Premium Service Representative in the Bethlehem location I can honestly say it was the worst and most stressful working environment ever.  Very poor management, no communication, favoritism, poor work ethics, no interest in employee feedback for improvements.   I worked hard and gave it my best, but others around me got away with constant breaks, cut coupons, sat on cell phone better part of the 8 hour day and had no interest in working as a team.   Leaving was the best decision I have ever made.  I miss some of my co-workers, but nothing more."
bad,"horrible management-"
bad,"They butter you up from the moment you get hired,if you have any disabilities they will discriminate against you. The pay is ok, but be prepared for unrealistic expectations. The only way you move up within the company is to kiss up or be apart of their buddy buddy system. I was forced to work while having the flu and infecting other people or get written up for taking time off. They give you vacation time upfront, but no sick leave. If there is bad weather they would rather you kill yourself to come into work rather than to stay home. They are a insurance company, but the insurance there is horrible and hardly covers anything. It's a setup for failure. This company is horrible. They teach you a lot, but my advice is to learn all you can and get out!"
bad,Everyone is 100% disposable. Now matter how good you are at your job. Management is awful and they manipulate the system to get away with everything they are doing wrong.
bad,"Managment is not held accountable for abuse to the employees very stressful working conditions. Stats are achievable but barely at that, strict point system no drs notes accepted when you are sick you get a point"
bad,"Too much red tape to work here peacefully. Management is terrible and you have no guidance whatsoever. Zero common sense starting from the top. They cannot compete with their better competitors at the rate they are going and the way they are running their business. Go with United Health Care, or Aetna  or Humana that run their business as professional organizations and treat their employees with dignity and respect!"
bad,"Okay pay but with the stress level there should be more compensation. Managers are unapproachable and could careless about their employees. There is favoritism when it comes to career advancements. Other employees, including managers, are not friendly. It’s a heads down, constant calls type of environment"
bad,Has to be one of the worst companies. Advancement isn’t there if you aren’t a brown noser. Bosses can hold you back and there is nothing you can do about it. You do work at a level that you aren’t paid for. Everyone is paid $16 an hour if not a temp. CEO doesn’t do anything for current employees making over $16 an hour. Raises are by performance and that is how they determine your raise.
bad,"This job was very stressful, it was hard to get time off, it was a bit soul sucking. Back to back calls with very little time to recover after nasty ones."
bad,"Mucho estres, poca recompensa, muchas facciones peleando por poder,poca organizacion"
bad,"Terrible place to work....Cigna does not really care about their customers except for how the bottom line is affected - customer service has absolutely nothing to do with taking care of the customers.  They care even less for their employees."
bad,This please has poor management they want to work you to the point of is there a end.  They don't care about the employee nor do they stand up for some of their employee. they have their picks.  I would not refer anyone there.
bad,I enjoyed my job and was very good at it however they do not do  enough  to try to keep  good employees even the interview process needs a severe make over  they need a major overhaul on how to treat employees
bad,In the role of medical customer service you are taking calls all day. 30 min lunch. Hours are not conducive for someone with a family. Management is horrible High volume call center. Classroom training was horrible trainers played favorites.
bad,worked for this clinic for 6 months and went through 3 managers and 4 RN's. the Dr was great along with coworkers and the last manager did not care or bother to understand what went on in a medical clinic- she was not medical. patient safety and office security in danger and she allowed outsiders to belittle her staff. so no I would not work for this company again.
bad,"Quite frankly the worst experience of my life, a certain manager who proclaimed the company as 'his' and how he was the quality manager, not sure where the quality was as it was most certainly not in his department, without doubt the most unprofessional manager I have ever come across. The feedback from customers was 90% how bad the company was and hearing customers cry at least 3 times a week was evidential. Asking for help was near enough a sin and the ' referral ' times for when you could speak to a manager was another poor decision, a certain PSA had zero interest at all in assisting her colleagues. To sum this company up it is a disgrace, internal bullying is an issue which I doubt will be addressed and those with the ego's need a reality check and realise they they are employed by a mediocre catastrophe of a company."
bad,"I would start at 11:30am and begin making scheduled calls at 12 noon. Calls every 30 minutes which at times were not long enough. When dealing with customers with depression and suicidal thoughts it is very hard to just hang up on them which is what was expected. I loved my customers. I was excited to go to work everyday. Customers would schedule calls to talk to me often. I would send them resources on how to obtain free medications, free MD visits, free rent, food and a various amount of resources that I could offer them. I had the most amazing managers until my last manger who was a micro manager and was threatening and verbally harassing. My co workers were the best and the most helpful peers ever! I have never met such amazing people. We all worked together as a team and were there for each other at all times. I still keep in touch with them and see them when they are not at work. We were a family at work. I love them. The hardest part of my job would be the back to back 30 minute calls with no breaks in between and the suicide hotline calls from across the United States. It would be difficult finding what state and area they were located in and getting them help as soon as possible from locations that were unknown to me. The most enjoyable part of my job was my customers and being able to see them progress. It was amazing speaking with them, learning about their lives and cultures and doing whatever I could to make them better."
bad,"I worked there for two months .  Enough for me.  Do not work in the Customer Service or Appeals department.  Those managers will make your life a living nightmare.  If you don't brown nose or cheese all day, you are not a part of the group.  I would not not recommend this place to my worst enemy."
bad,"fairly good training. "
bad,I did not fit into the cliquey & gossipy environment in the sales office.
bad,very employee unfriendly!!!!!!! terrible place to work. some management teams are great while others are less then par. do not offer sick days.. after 10 latenesses or sick days=termination!!!!
bad,"Working as a behavioral health coach for Cigna was possibly the worst career choice I could have made. They treat ""some"" of their employees like children, and encourage others within the St. Louis, Mo office to tell on one another. In addition, they offer some people year end bonuses, while not specifying what it takes to earn a bonus. The entire office, and the management who occupy it are bullies and encourage cliques."
bad,"A secretary got fired on the spot for not wearing pantyhose on a hot day. I was browbeaten into notarizing documents with the person not being present. If you leave, they try to ruin your reputation."
bad,"One Word - Micro-manage. If you want to work for a place that doesn't allow you to be proactive then this is the place to work. For a company that is growing, this philosophy should not be in place."
bad,"There is no politically correct description of working for CIGNA. On your first day, they have you sign an agreement, ""We agree we have to offer you health insurance, if you agree you will never sue us."" This is not an expression. They made the insurance so expensive, that employees quit a health insurance company, because they couldn't afford that company's health insurance. You get two 10 minute breaks each day. If you are on break for 11 or more minutes, you will hear your name on walkie-talkies, asking who has seen you. You're over your break time. They pay to the penny what other companies pay close by."
bad,Micromanaged Run far from this company it was an exhaustingly mess with your mind experience of employment  that I would not wish on my worst enemy!!!
bad,unfavorable very unpleasant experience I do not wish to say any more.  Other than archaic management with their approach to today's world.  No flexibility for handicapped folks to WFH and no elevator to navigate to one's desk and needs to ;earn to use freight elevator.
bad,"Do yourself a favor and do not apply here. Unless you want to add stress and anxiety to your life. Management micromanages everything to the max. They watch every Single thing you do, can’t even go to the bathroom in peace, they’ll watch that too. They lie to you. There’s no room for improvement, unless you managers favorite. If not, you’ll won’t go anywhere."
bad,"Poor company. Strategically and theoretically, the company has an impressive business model. Problem is that middle management is not held accountable to this model and the message gets lost on the frontline."
bad,There is a lot of racism within leadership and sales. Leadership and management are unorganized and have little to no ethical integrity. As you will work with a team the protocols are very dysfunctional. If you are looking for a company with a solid structure and process oriented Cigna does not meet that level.
bad,Overworked and state they care but it’s all about numbers and if you don’t deliver you are pushed out  I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone it’s not a nice environment at all
bad,"I worked at 500 Great Circle Rd in Nashville, TN as an Appeals Associate. We were not allowed to speak to our coworkers. Men were paid more per hour than women doing the same job. Lastly, my boss was the most disgusting and vile pervert who talked about every female who walked by his desk. Three women, myself included, filed official complaints with the company. He's still there and we all have left."
bad,Not really compensated for the amount of work you are expected to do. Medical insurance is not as good as you would expect working for a health insurance company.
bad,"Such an odd place to work. Everything has to be cignatized. I mean our director was let go for performance as an regular employee. Then 8 yrs later he comes back as a SR director? This is in the trading side, IT."
bad,"Unrealistic goals set, management always was changing and teams always being realigned. Every second of the day was micromanaged. I did not use my nursing skills because they focus more on money."
bad,I worked here for a little over 2 years only to be fired for “call avoiding” they said they had months of proof of. Never did they show me this proof or did I have a conversation with a supervisor about the behavior they were considering call avoiding. The micro managing in that department is unbearable. You have your direct supervisor who most of the time doesn’t even know how your position works or what you have to deal with and all they care about is that the numbers look good so they’re the sup with the best performing team. Then you have another part of the company who actually does the scheduling of your day and if your even a minute off of that schedule they’re messaging asking what you’re doing. They expect perfection and detailed notation of your calls but want it done in less than 90 seconds and anything more than that you’re basically not a good employee in their eyes. That might be possible if their systems weren’t junk. Overall it’s a miserable place to work and management is just incompetent and plays favorites.
bad,"Terrible job, nothing but favoritism and managers hand picking their favorites for promotion's regardless of actual skills. No room for growth, inconsistent management, no compassion and understanding for their employees unless your one of the chosen favorites"
bad,"They do not care about their employees or customers. Its all a numbers game. A facade, a sales pitch."
bad,"People are nice job isnt Promotions are either superVisor or Trainer. Training is pretty much the same job just via chat . Response  time are too long and the people are already angry when they "
bad,"Management is really incompetent.Your penalized for missing days but not rewarded for good attendance either. Management is.  My original supervisor claimed to be a Christian. It was all in title. When it came down to being honest she lied more than the devil himself. "
bad,"Selling questionable product to dentists office all day. Receiving and uploading appropriate documentation when dentists office finally gives in to product being sold to office. Goal to be met every day, and constantly reminded of it. Management (directors) questionable integrity, honesty, and humanity here! "
bad,Management is disjointed and provides mixed messages creating an environment of insecurity for many of the employees. Employees are very good and do great with limited resources provided. A lot of management turnover.
bad,Training is long but not consistent.You learn a lot of information and your trainer and manager will determine whether you sink or swim. My manager was vindictive and did not help her whole team. She had favorites to the point of filing a complaint. The work culture is the very definition of the road to h*** is paved with good intentions. The hardest part of the job is digesting all of the information and actually being able to implement it. You are never fully prepared. The best part of the job was being able to assist customers with their claims and solving issues.
bad,I've never worked in a more unfriendly environment. Manager is not interested in your development. Promises made at hiring that have since been rescinded. Blatant favoritism and unwillingness to help you achieve any sort of goals. Unprofessional and immature management.
bad,"CSRs at this location don't have as stressful a time as at other locations. The Austin office primarily services the medicare supplement and other supplemental policies, so there aren't as many calls, they aren't as in-depth, and metrics aren't hard to meet and they aren't stressed constantly. With that said, the office culture in the customer service department is straight up toxic. A handful of gossipy people bully and whisper in the ears of management. I've been working here since last year and I did not receive a raise or bonus while people who routinely show up for work late (which is of course a huge no no when the phones are supposed to be staffed) and are always causing some type of drama did receive those raises. Some people were recently fired and the rumor is that they were just being gossiped about and the bullies took it to management who fired the wrong people. Now I and others worry that will happen to us. One of the few people who moved up to a higher paying job in this department did so at least in part because she started a rumor about a male supervisor ogling her. If you keep your head down and do your work, you are a target. You have to participate in the middle school type antics to make any headway here. Although the ""call center"" is just a department within a building, the culture feels like any typical, low-rent phone factory."
bad,"Lack of professionals, system never worked properly. Training was so long and nothing was used out on the floor . management was not knowledgeable and rude.... I can keep going all day..."
bad,"Call center is a very stressful environment. They have almost impossible to reach call metrics and you are constantly micromanaged on every call. You are expected to make every customer happy but aren’t given tools or ways to do so. They have strict adherence policy and you are docked if you take late breaks or lunches. You’re expected to take your time with each customer and turn each call into an interaction but they have average talk time and you have to meet certain criteria. Pay is poor for the stress you endure and workload you handle. Management is not on your side as they are all about quantity of calls you make and not quantity. You’re told there is career advancement but they constantly freeze departments during busy seasons (pretty much all year) and your manager can refuse letting you get out of your department. Very poor health insurance plan for an health insurance company! Very high deductibles and a lot of non covered procedures and medicines. They constantly mandate overtime, due to being short staffed. You are at their mercy especially if you are a work from home. They have constant bidding for schedules to fit their needs. If your metrics aren’t good you get any shift they need filled.  They say they are a family oriented company but to them you’re just a body taking calls."
bad,"Call center representative for Payers Precert. Job is easy pretty dull. Management ruins the program. There is one ""queen"" who controls her managers. The direct manager kept having to ask permission to make exceptions which were rarely granted. No chance at advancement. No room in the budget was the explanation I received. When I attempted to help over come call center obstacles, I was advised it was not my job and they paid someone else to do that."
bad,"Management is poor, no room for advancement. High Deductibles and low pay for the amount of expected work. If your not in the ""click"" you won't get far and are not appreciated in any way."
bad,There was far to much disrespectful and unprofessional Managers work at the company. Also the lack of HR presents made for a bad work environment. There was no one the employees could go to the assistance.
bad,...until new and younger manager.  Long work days. The culture was becoming younger and younger over the years. the hardest part and the most enjoyable part were the people.
bad,"Micro-managed, favoritism, got in trouble for taking an unplanned break, even bathroom breaks.  Was very stressful and much was expected to be learned and known in a limited amount of time."
bad,"People who had been there for long periods of time were being fired for very small reasons. Management doesnt want to teach you to navigate the system. Training was a joke and misleading, we were not suppose to work on the phones. Manager hoovers over your work station. Pay sucks."
bad,"Probably not too far from what you'd find in a typical fortune 100 company. Culture seems positive at first, but the warm-fuzzies soon run out."
bad,Entirely too many untrained supervisors. Not enough tech support for the issues at hand. Not much of a professional work environment as one would believe it to be. If proper training is given to leadership teams I believe the workplace here at Cigna would be more constructive and positive.
bad,"You sit at your desk and cannot speak to your team in person while on the clock, even to ask a question, all questions are to be submitted to coaches via a slow electronic system. Almost every interaction is virtual or by phone call."
bad,"You are nothing but an employee number to this company.  Your manager will be in another state and you never get to meet them.  Your ""meetings"" are all online and impersonal.  They don't care about you or your family."
bad,"What they don't tell you on the interview. 1- if taking PTO's and you don't remain current on your tasks, your PTO request become voided or if you leave for PTO, you will not be paid and receive formal discipline. 2- despite your entry skill level, you could be moved to a complex team with no support. 3- You will be doing what is know as ""call center"" tasks, you will be rated and disciplined on your ability to answer every call, the phone system is on a ""round Robin"" feature, this makes doing your job impossible. 4- Management is not supportive rather, tyrants. There was an issue of ""not noticing"" associates working off the clock, this was resolved in 12/2014. The pay is not relevant to all tasks this job requires. The stress is mentally stressing and the moral is depressing."
bad,"All I can say about this place, the mail order pharmacy floor in Horsham, Pa., is that it is a place to work while looking for something better. "
bad,"paperwork, sometimes lots of xrays, sometimes no xrays, lots of ekg's, retinal eye exams, glaucoma screening, bone density measurments, cleaning of all equipment, management is not experienced and doesn't run a good ship, most co-worker have the same work ethic as myself, but there are a few who just show up to collect a paycheck, hardest part of the job is always having to clean up other people messes just because I am proficiant at what I do, most enjoyable part is helping the patients to feel better and have a better quality of life"
bad,Company did not offer any training to just job shadowing.   They did not pay very well and managers were very unprofessional.
bad,"This was a very busy patient service center, staffed with 4 Phlebotomist and a supervisor. I did around 45 draws a day when doing phlebotomy. I learned how to process specimens and front desk check in/ order entry. The management was horrible and refused to appropriately handle ethical issues at the workplace. My co-workers were amazing but the supervisor made it stressful. I resigned  a short time after being hired and without having another job lined up. I just could not work for a company with poor management and unprofessional demeanor."
bad,"Policies are in place for this to be a great place to work, however the management in place is incompetent.  They lack management skills as well as the ability to manage diverse teams.  It is not uncommon for new management to come aboard every few years and wipe out an entire team to bring on who they want that will not challenge them or they make life miserable to where you want to quit.  Do not approach HR with an issue as they do nothing to promote the companies policies.  Very few minorities in charge or executive positions. The culture is very young and clueless. "
bad,"each day requires a great deal of focus and attention to detail while connected to a phone and computer;"
bad,"Run as fast as you can from this ""Medicare Advantage plan""! This was the most dysfunctional work environment I have ever experienced. From 2012-2014 (3) management turn overs. No electronic data base. Remote home based promised then taken away. Bonus's promised and still waiting. There is no Human Resource support nor is there any administrative support and very little IT support as well. Field nurse's are not placed in a geographic area close to their home's but made to drive ridiculous distances from their homes to their client primary care physician office's. The Baltimore management team has no management experience. They claim to direct the Philadelphia market but have no idea were Cigna plan physician's are located nor do they care. The training program in Baltimore was poorly delivered and the trainer spoke broken English and hard to understand. Very unapproachable management team that prefers to dictate rather than collaborate. They bully their employees and provide no positive reinforcement. Write unprofessional email's, unfamiliar with CIGNA corporate policies, reprimand and give written warnings out like candy with no follow up on performance improvement initiatives. Reactive rather than proactive. Head executive is based in the Philadelphia office however never says a word to his fellow team leaders...except at monthly meetings when he gets to eat a free lunch. Claims to have an open door policy but employees get reprimanded for not following chain of command. There is no room for growth in this company nor will you be supported for any contributions that you have"
bad,"am a provider representative for the Cigna-HealthSpring,  HMO Medicare Advantage Plan, new to East TN in 2012. In this role I am responsible for maintaining a 12 county coverage area in the current East TN region. This Region includes over 800 practicing physicians, their staff and each of their multiple locations. This network includes all specialty types, some ancillary locations and all the PCP’s both independent and employed. From a management and operations perspective I am the point of contact for these practices from the time of initial recruitment, through contracting, credentialing, system loading, and initial education on our Medicare Risk model. Once providers are then effective with our plan my job is to assist them with any and all questions or issues they might encounter related to items such as membership coverage, coding, claims, contractual rates, referrals, precert,  etc…"
bad,opening mail and processing the claims and meeting deadlines. Learning the different codes
bad,"Culture at Cigna changed quite dramatically for the worse when a change of leadership occurred. In the contact centre there was a re-structure almost every year (even before I started), often just renaming roles. This meant I never felt safe or trusted in my role."
bad,Opportunity in job advancement is not likely. Poor management and miserable work culture. Consider this a temporary job not a career path. Don’t get comfortable when hearing quite a few color employees got PIP then forced to leave without any compensation package. Not be surprised for Cigna to get discrimination lawsuits at all.
bad,"Unless you are a brown noser; even when you do your job correctly with timely assistance you would still be criticized for anything for either being on the phone to long. Or saying something although professional or calming the customer down it is still not correct. Many supervisors there and managers for sure have little to no experience and are very disrespectful. With my years of Call Center and Customer Service experience I was doubled trained for no reason at all. If I was so bad then why was I not fired within my first 90 days of being on the job? Cigna has fired many of people over the last few years for idiotic things. But will promote brown nose folks and some people who have no conduct for customers and /or the job rules and regulations. Many have quit for better jobs especially when the people who preach leadership are being hypocrites themselves. If you need technical assistance because of a computer problem you are being accused of working to slow and blaming technology which one supervisor told me which is so stupid. Then this same supervisor told to be a leader you must handle many thing. But the supervisor themselves could not handle this pressure if they were put under it. Also another but new supervisor from another department tells me that they are here to help you succeed but for sure are lying on that. They hide behind your stat score numbers of quality, time on phone with customer etc;, Then will alter those stats to make many customer service representatives look bad. I too been in bigger business in my job career and seen this done here to my sad dismay."
bad,Worst place ever to work. management was ridiculous very poorly run company benefits were okay for the size of the company. Very bad place to work. Never have a good thing to say.
bad,"The management is a joke, the Supervisors are jokes, the corporate policies are a joke and even after you do EXACTLY what your supervisor tells you to do, they kick you down harder. I am regretful of how my employment ended, but extremely happy it did, I would not reccomend this employer."
bad,Typical call center job. Would not consider it a career. It's all about favoritism. Metrics are definitely all they care about. You are only a number. Worst job I have had and I have previously worked at a different call center. Benefits and time off are nice and one of the better paying jobs in the area. But it comes down to the people you work with and for... including the people you have to speak to.
bad,"the company was Bravo which i loved then it was bought by Healthspring which dismantled everything and then a year later Cigna bought it out."
bad,"Terrible. Stay away I beg you. Horrible please to work. Nurse managers are a joke and the work balance is not there. Very stressful job and you are NOT appreciated. "
bad,Would NEVER work for them after they lied about transitioning us. We had relatively flexible hours. The new place we are to “transition” to is NOT flexible at all.
bad,Horrible place to make a career. No work / home life balance. No empathy for the customers or employees. They do not take the concerns of the customer and turn them into some working and learning experience.
bad,"I've been with Cigna for several years now and a lot has changed this year. It's a corporate insurance company. That fact alone tells you all you need to know about the work environment but in case it doesn't:"
bad,"If you want to be exploited, disrespected,and humiliated work in member services at Leon Medical Centers health plans/ Cigna Healthpring of Florida at Doral corporate offices. they are not professional at all. they will step over your rights and management will humiliate you, hire their family and acquaintances and make you do their work."
bad,The environment at CIGNA use to be very pleasant but in the past two to three years the moral has decreased and it has become a very stressful place to work
bad,"Never in all my professional career, have I ever been treated with such bias, and disrespect. This company has a negative and bullyish Leadership culture that is toxic and frustrating. The environment is extremely chaotic and Leadership is hired based on friendships only - not merit or professional competencies. If you are looking for a position to just be a robot, take orders, be overlooked despite your achievements, and remain in the shadows professionally - this is the job for you!"
bad,"Horrible office and hostile work environment. and You could never get enough work done due to always having to pick up phone calls like customer service department is there for or your asked to do other projects. You are working overtime constantly but have to ask for permission to work it which makes no sense because there is no way you can finish your work load in an 8 hour day. High turnover.  Management is the worst part honestly, they really need to take classes on how to treat employees. Poor management and the director is very disrepectful. The way she talks to people is not okay. It also seems they promote their “friends”."
bad,"As an employee who started in an entry level position and moved up, they do not respect their employees. I am extremely under paid because I started in an entry level position. Additionally the directors within behavioral are horrible, expect to be manipulated and lied to."
bad,Very unproductive place to work for Morale was bad very stressful place rude individuals to work for No compassion or empathy for the customers  management was micromanaging you every time  everything was about making the bottom line productivity but no assistance to the customers they claim to care for
bad,"Poor management, constant over turn, managers goal is to close claims, unprofessional, lavk of employee apreciation, cannot be sick unplanned without punishment"
bad,"i highly miss working for cigna, it was a very good company  to work for. I would recommend  anybody to work for cigna.  i had 18 years of service and i love every bit of it."
bad,"Cigna in Austin is the only location I can speak for. They are run on emotions not strategy. There are excellent people there that would like to contribute to their overall environment and operational success. There have been metrics, slideshow presentations taken to upper management by various individuals with successful backgrounds. Cigna leadership turns a blind eye. They seem to unknowingly sabotage their organization. "
bad,The PSC is a poorly managed facility. The expectations for quality are unattainable and the only time your manager ever contacts you is if something is wrong. They treat their employees like machines and they don't care about the well being of their employees. The job itself is not bad but the work place is all wrong.
bad,This job sucks you are answering phone calls all day and never get any work done due to all the distractions. You are working overtime constantly and have to ask for permission to work it. No work home life balance. Not worth it. Too much work. High turnover. Horrible systems slow system. Management really needs to take classes on how to treat employees.  Poor management.
bad,it is a great place to work.  Th management is very involved.  The management is doing all the right things and is a great place to work.  There is work life balance.  I learned health care.  The job is very involved.  I enjoy working here.
bad,Culture does not inspire. Lack of leadership and vision. Poor long-term viability. Limited opportunities for growth. Organization does not align skill sets appropriately to put employees in position to succeed.
bad,"Started off as a good company/place to work.New management on East and West is nothing less than micromanagement."
bad,"This was a very stressful job with very little room for advancement. "
bad,"This company wastes more money on meetings that do not apply even to our office.  Some people work hard while others (being favorites) are allowed to do nothing.  All phone calls are recorded, you are NOT allowed to say much, there is a SCRIPT for most of the calls.  Many of our patients are uneducated but jargon still does not change for their understanding.  Forget it if a patient has any questions....the SCRIPT says ""call your doctor"". Can't mail too many education materials (cost), takes a while to get the calls started because there is a SCRIPT just for the opening.  "
bad,Poor Management Supervisors are clueless no respect for the workers no organization and make the rules up as they go no job security and fires people for no reasons when they want not a stable environment.
bad,"Incoming healthcare calls from open enrollment to locating doctors "
bad,"take about 100 calls a day, in order to move up you have a be a brown noser. Everyone is out for themselves. Callers cuss you out becasue of issues that are beyond your control. Doesnt give enough tools to complete the job. Always, have to go thru 3 or 4 people to have an issue resolved."
bad,Cigna - HealthSpring upper management is the most unethical people I have ever worked on a project before.  They do not believe in processes or procedures and do not follow best practices for software development.  Since I have been back on the job market I have been told by numerous recruiters within the Nashville area that this is not the best environment and they have a very bad reputation.
bad,benefits are horrible...a typical day at work was dealing with customers all day on the phone
bad,"If continual learning is what you expect in a job , this is not the place for you. Very unorganized in every stand point.  Managers lie to you right in front of your face."
bad,"I liked my time at Cigna, I really did...that is, until I got a feel exactly for how things work. Cigna prides themselves on being in a ""business of caring"", yet what they display on a daily basis is almost the exact opposite. Management is INEPT and some of the worst I've ever had the displeasure of working under. The favoritism they have towards certain team members is ridiculous and if you're not one of their ""minions"", your work day is a living nightmare. "
bad,"Worse call center enviorment l've ever experienced. Moral of associates is always low due to back, to back calls, high turn-over and under staffing. Associates are given very little time off the phone only allowing 30 minute team meeting once a month. Managers, and most supervisors provide very little assistance when in need of help. They're only focus is to ensure that associates are meeting company performance metrics, besides that they're useless. Company benefits are terrible, and expensive, and no ""sick days""!!!  Sick days are counted as occurrences, and after 10 occurrences in a year whether your out a full day, or you left early because your child is sick, no exceptions your ""fired""!!!"". Also there are no bathroom breaks aloud, if you do have to potty you'll have to take it in ""after call""  which hurts your metrics. Management is constantly blaming associates for the company's ""poor"" customer reviews when the incompotent management team won't fix the dated web site, that fails to charge customers cc requiring customers to call customer service and wait on hold 5-10minutes due under staffing. By that time they get thru they're ready to rip the CSA's head off. The customers wait to pay they're bill because the web site doesn't provide on-line bill pay. Also the company forces unsuspecting customers into mail order when they enroll into cigna health insurance which causes hostility between the csa and the consumer. The customer usually doesn't find out they have mandatory mail order until they go to they're local pharmacy and they are notified your perscription isn't covered."
bad,"Avoid this job! They throw you in OJT for 3 months Once out, they dump nearly 90 claims on you to manage. Most claims are problems from another manager’s caseload that you “inherit.” All cases are different and you are on your own to figure out what to do. Calculations of disability pmts are done LONG HAND on paper! System doesn’t calculate! CMs quit daily, as you will get emails announcing it! Worst job ever."
bad,The work load is insane and they don’t want to hear feed back they want it done and don’t care how much time it takes to get it done. My management had to delegate work because she took no time to re educate herself on the new systems. She would trash talk her bosses and she would constantly be verbally abusive and even when reported there was no correction on her part instead they just rid of me.
bad,"I worked here for three years, it was fine for the first year and a half then it went downhill.  You have to ask to get up and go to the bathroom it feels like your in grade school, also there is not much support from management, HR, or anyone else.  They also screw up on your pay frequently and it never gets fixed, they outsource payroll.  The benefits aren’t that good either. the deductible and out of pocket is high. The couple good things that Cigna does offer is paid time off, the option to work from home, casual dress code, a decent hourly rate if they pay correctly and 401k.  If you leave they will screw you over and don’t care."
bad,"After working at Cigna for over a year, having excellent attendance, metrics, and quality, I was fired, but not really told why. Work place bullies are horrible there and management does not like to confront people when they are wrong. I was told I would be getting a nice sized bonus and was up for a raise and promotion. I was always on time and did a great job. Instead of doing due diligence, management decided to fire two of us who were actually excellent employees and give bonuses and raises to people who don’t show up to work, show up late, and lie. None of it made sense. The work isn’t hard, but it’s not worth your time. Cigna does not have a good reputation and there is a reason for that. I had better benefits when I was with a different company."
bad,Worked there as a temp.  Never knew what was going to happen on a daily basis.  Worked with buffoons that got away with everything short of murder and the boss was clueless.  Management is never around.  Theyre often eating or planning to eat at a party off site every friday instead of keeping an eye on the people that slack off and the ones that bust their butts to actually work.  They would let people that had been there for 26 years go and not give a reason why.  They rarely hire full time because theyre too cheap to give full benefits.  Just another cheap multi million dollar company that skirts all kinds of labor laws too I am sure.  So sad.  I wanted to work there for years and finally got in and was saddened by every aspect.
bad,"Doing the data entry part of my job was enjoyable, until they forced us all to learn phones and we no longer had any room for advancement. It didn't matter that I started off as a data entry rep and had no desire to be on the phones. They didn't care that I had been a reliable worker. I didn't matter that not all people are cut out to be on the phones. Give us your best for 10 years and then when you struggle with the change, there is nothing they can do for you. I was forced to resign."
bad,"My experience with Cigna was poor. We were lied to at the interview about our job duties. Managers practice cronyism and you will not advance even if you have excellent work performance. The company puts holds on your department, not allowing an employee to transfer or apply to other departments causing you to miss out on a better opportunity or career growth, only for their own benefit."
bad,"Job was lots of stress, with no support from management.  Policies rarely adhered to when attempting to enforce. Was constantly thrown under the bus when trying to go by departmental policies when complained by other departments."
bad,Great place from a compensation perspective.  Very focussed on earnings with a focus on growing membership and expectations to the board.  Definitely functions as a publicly traded company.
bad,My department totally stunk; was set up for failure starting with my first day on the job.  Manager was awful.  Employees were dishonest;  I was working with the ethics department but then I was laid off before whole situation could be resolved.
bad,"For me Cigna not was not my favorite job I've ever had. You have to ""log out"" of your phone to use the restroom. The building I was in was quite large and took about 2 mins just to walk to the restroom. I got back to my desk after 5 minutes, with my at the time supervisor looking for me wondering why it took me so long to use the bathroom?? 5  minutes is long, considering 2 of those were spent walking? Plus hearing peoples VERY sad stories can wear on you over time. Not the best job to have for the kind of heart."
bad,"Team did not effectively communicate that I was even coming on board to other team members. Majority of team  was remote and the ones that worked in office couldnt have cared less to answer questions. Not somewhere I would suggest working if you will have a learning curve when you first start a position."
bad,"The job is easy and the workflow is good but Cigna HealthSpring is extremely unorganized and can't seem to get it together for the customers or providers. "
bad,"Cigna is unnecessarily stressful. Company cares about money, not customers. System is extremely to much for the high expectations cigna holds. High turnover rate. I almost lost my job due to being pregnant"
bad,"This company is all about favoritism and friends. With this company you have to almost be someone's flunky to move up on the company. This company is very disappointing and disorganized. All the departments are behind in work, we have gotten calls about provides claims check bouncing, many of the staff aren't trained with knowledge and QA just does whatever they want to your QA. I would say the turn over rate is so high because the place is all over the place. Many of the big wigs are getting termened, many lord about the numbers to state Medicaid and for that a scantion was placed on Cigna health spring. This is just a contract with Cigna, I would hope Cigna would place their business in better hands.  Happy I left when I did, your pay isn't really your pay. At the wan of the year they take your PTO away and everything is unpaid so they dnt have to pay many of agents. I wouldn't work here unless you like disorganization."
bad,Non supportive management.....No one to ask should you have a question that your notes couldn't tell you. I have nothing else to add. It's a call center with no support of any kind.
bad,"this is one of the worst places I have worked. The job I was hired for was GREATLY over sold and work I was given was not challenging. "
bad,"unrealistic expectations"
bad,"HealthSpring has a great benefits package and salary structure. However, as a nurse, it was very difficult for me to be the one to tell a post open heart patient that he/she had to go to a nursing home to recover, rather than the rehab hospital suggested by the physician, because they didn't meet medicare guidelines. Also, there was little to no support from the corporate offices in Houston and Dallas. The work load was more than one nurse could do. Onsite visits at the local hospitals, as well as telephonically managing 17 other facilities. The company in general needs to be more compassionate and patient focused."
bad,"Spent a decade plus at this company and management pigeon holes you in to a position and it is an act of GOD to move up. Benefits went from EXCELLENT in 1997 to down right absurd when I left. I had a wonderful pension plan, amazing health benefits and the employer contribution was great, as well as many other benefits that helped me and my family. Then in 2002 clients I handled had BETTER benefits and insurance than we had and paid less. This company is a big player but treats its employees with lip service and lies. They purposelessly set up an employee handbook that can get you fired no matter what you do, it helps them keep the legal costs down. GOOD LUCK working for this ""out for myself"" company. By the time you get to retire you wont have anything to show for it but a broken back."
bad,"If you’re a person of color there’s a slight chance that you might have to jump hurdles that others won’t understand. From as small as people not holding the door for you because they assume you don’t work there to everything you say being taken out of context. The entire company shouldn’t be defined by that, but know it exists. Truly depends on your department. Avoid pharmacy if you can."
bad,"I was a CPhT for Cigna Specialty Home Delivery Pharmacy, which went thru a merger and is now in the process of closing. Although the experience wasn't completely negative overall, I don't trust that the company places customer needs as a high priority."
bad,"Doesn't worth the money to work there."
bad,Very rare opportunities to advance. Often hire external employees over their own. Very few minorities hired in band 2 and up roles. Hostile work environment for minorities.
bad,"Bully-clickish management was extremely unprofessional! Divulging the details of your personal life determined if you kept your job! The work environment was extremely UNSANITARY, the work areas were extremely dusty...no open door air  circulation; coupled With contaminated water, in the area of horsham, was a doozie to my overall wellbeing. I was constantly I'll! Thank God it's over!!!!!"
bad,"Not a great department to work in, poor management and no confidentiality whatsoever when raising any problems. Managers asked to do tasks not specific to their own team and don't have time to look after their team. Horrible working environment at times with little or no talking aloud."
bad,Poor Management. As well as poor communication no room for advancement.  There isn't any structure.  Management tends to play favorites to employees. Senior Management very poor.
bad,"i was fired from Cigna, because i was not meeting productivity. i working in Medical Customer Service!. so you get people that call in with real issues and they expect you to answer and solve the issue in under 2 mins. I actually have a heart and feel for these people that are getting screwed. this place sucks! if are a fast, smooth talker. this place is great for you.. it wasn't a great fit for me. the benefits were nice, 401k, medical and dental insurance.... you have PTO... but its super freaking hard to take it. and you get in trouble if you want to take it. i had to miss the birth family babies... because i didn't have the pto.... i got married earlier that year and wanted to take a few days off for a small honeymoon..... Bull, the managers they hire 90% of them have no idea what i was doing... and had never done what i was doing.... they say we promote from within.... thats a bunch of BBQ sandwich... in the 2 years i worked there. i had 5 different managers 2 were before i even left the 2 months mandatory training,"
bad,"If you are strong headed, you will butt heads with management. You are to be seen not heard. Hard work is valued but vacation time will leave ur area unattended and patients as well. I would never go back even if it was the last job available."
bad,management team contently changes the work lace is very confusing because the management team changes it seems every couple of months.  The work environment is very back stabbing.
bad,"It was the worst place I have ever worked. It is like high school everyone is in a cliche and they don't want to let you in. The job is horrible people yell at you, curse at you and don't want you to call back, which it is your job to do."
bad,never knew that upper management was even located at my location.  First time I have ever worked at a company where management wanted nothing to do with the workers.
bad,"Typical day: coding from charts to abstract for HCC payments by Medicare.  "
bad,"Intimidation, harassment, and threats from your boss were a common thing.  I was threatened with my job many times.  I was sexually harassed by my boss and it wasn't funny like in the movies.  I almost walked out a dozen times.  But they pay was great and the benefits began on your first day.  That's why I stayed."
bad,"I've never had such a terrible experience.  My boss read every line of my code and even though it worked and gave the right answers, because it wasn't the way she would code it, she would make me code it all over.  "
bad,"I was continuously surprised at the lack of the practical experience of the managers and director at Cigna in Plano. The program I worked for was a chronic condition support coaching program, so you would think that the supervisors/director would have at least SOME experience in disease management, or even employee management. Nope."
bad,"The team were very stressful to deal with, when on the phone to a patient they are laughing so hard you can not hear the patient. If you ask to lower their voice a little, they give you attitude. When asking for help, they are very uncooperative. I was glad to finally retire there."
bad,This was definitely the worst experience I've ever had. I had one manager who like to belittle and patronize people on the regular. There were times I cried at work because of how stressed I was on top of how she was treating people. There is  very little employee appreciation. The culture is boring and mundane. It's not a fun place to work. Within the first month after training I was already applying for new jobs again. I was trying to go back to my old job ASAP!  Cigna Health Spring is not a good place for those just starting out or those who've got a short attention span. Cigna Health Spring has no good management and no consistency.
bad,"It’s a terrible job. In training they make the job seem so great and that there are so many opportunities for growth in the company. It’s actually the most stressful job. People complain on every call about how terrible the insurance coverage is and how inconvenient the systems and processes are. It’s a very expensive insurance and covers hardly anything. The company doesn’t care about their workers. They say they do and they give you stupid little Knick knacks and hand out cupcakes and junk food. For a HEALTH insurance company, you would think they would promote healthy eating and give out healthy snacks to their employees. WRONG. You have 5 days you can call off in a year, a rolling year. So don’t ever get sick. You’ll be strapped down with a headset on taking calls. Overall, the company sucks and the job sucks. Don’t waste your time."
bad,"Narcissistic Leadership, cliques, gossip, and Rumors, dysfunctional/negative workplace and obvious favoritism. Leadership was unprofessional and did not support staff with professional development. Would not recommend others to work in the contracting/licensing  team under current management."
bad,"From the time of interview to the whole 3 months of training my class was told a a lot of lies that range from schedules, working from home, bonuses, pto,etc. The pay is good but at times feel like it should be more for what you deal with on daily basis. Just like any job there are good and bad managers. Top members of management do not really care that employees have lives outside of cigna. The amount of paid time off you get is great but is very hot or miss with days you can take off."
bad,"You learn alot about the type of worker they require and how closely you match or do not match that job description."
bad,"The structure of the Customer Care department is not structured. Order is not in place and when new information is given, proper training is not in place for the employees to receive and apply the information."
bad,First off the upper management hardly ever comes out of their offices to actually find out what's going on in their department. HR is only virtual so there is no one to go to for issues with supervisors or anything else...they give you a number to call and the HR person reached is obviously trained to tell you how your issue cannot be proven so it's not valid. You do get plenty of time off and flexibility from Cigna as a corporation. It's just the Premium Solutions Everyday Health Engagement department that really needs to be cleaned out starting with management. If you're not into their click it's not going to be a good job for you.
bad,Call center has the worse turn-over rate and reputation throughout the entire company which is currently in a class action lawsuit. If you are on the lower end of the corporate ladder this is not a good work environment. The entire system of management needs a long overdue makeover because it does not work.
bad,"I got hired onto this company with the feeling that Cigna loved its employees. And maybe in the past that was true. After 3 years with the company, they closed down 3 separate departments company wide and sending hundreds upon hundreds of jobs to Chennia, India and Manila, Philippines, laying off the departments and not doing a thing to try and place those that are hardworking individuals that dedicated their time and energy to make the company better. It's funny how they can pay their CEO millions every year, along with all the executives, yet they still feel the company isn't profitable enough and insists on sending jobs to underpaid people in other countries. Shame on you, Cigna and David Cordani (CEO)."
bad,"Ome of the worat companies I have worked at.  Too many chiefs and not enough Indians. Contradiction by upper levels. Too much drama,  too much talking about others that work there"
bad,"The company has poor management, pays women less than men, and the benefits are expensive. The company forces high turnover by outsourcing work to India while demanding more of it's shrinking US workforce. Last year two teams were let go/laid off because they discovered and reported unequal pay for women to the EEOC. Cigna was also part of pushing the ACA to force higher profits at taxpayer expense."
bad,Working in the intake department is very stressful . Management is more concern with call tie than they are with your giving excellent service. Jobs are being outsourced and people are not being taken care of.
bad,Entire day was spent on phone with customers who were calling in with questions or complaints about claims.  I learned empathy while dealing with those customers.  The hardest part of the job was following company policy of being clocked to only spend a couple of minutes on call and to NOT give customer a straight answer in hopes they would give up on pushing for payment of claim.  Most customers were old and easily confused and I just kept thinking of my Grandmother being on the other end of the phone and having to give her the run around.  Remember this was a good many years ago and I have been told corporate culture has changed to be more customer friendly which is a good thing.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when I could help a confused customer or bring about resolution of complaint.
bad,"Please refer to my resume for accurate employment dates."
bad,"I enjoy working with the multitude of customer from different account-companies learning and explaining the health and wellness programs benefits, eligibilty rewards and helping customer's to be aware of features of their insurance.  I enjoyed matching customer with the coaches who are nurses, behavioralist, exercise physiologist, and dieticians-nutritionist.  The hardest part of the job was SOP guidelines and audit matrix's changing frequently. Turnover among employees is forever happening.  Constant moving from location in the building to different floors and different sides of the building.  The Most enjoyable part of the Job is assisting customer and working with the coaches who appreciate the Personal Care Advocated who assess, engaged the customer in the programs and transfer or schedule the customer with the coaches."
bad,"Interview and background check process took 3 months."
bad,"My overall review of Cigna is that they are an ok place to work. A typical day at work as an appeals coordinator is that I usually start out the day issuing letters of denials either for medical necessity or administrative denials when facilities or providers call for authorization of mental health inpatient stays or outpatient treatment. After doing that then i get into my regular workload for the day where appeals are sent in and scanned on to a computer system and assigned out to appeals coordinators. We look at them, figure out what kind of appeal they are and set them up for review or handle certain appeals myself. Throughout the day we have other responsibilities including handling projects handed out by my supervisor and also different aspects of the job that i handle as well on a day to day basis."
bad,very hectic place. working with young people who do not have values in life.
bad,This job started great but bad management destroyed it quickly. Overall its a good job. Like any other job...poor leadership will cripple any team environment.
bad,Not treated the same as others due to my position and my health issue. I wasn't really treated fair and when accommodation was needed for my medical issue I was then treated unequal and felt bullied.
bad,"Although you received a decent pay rate compared to other call centers in the area you were basically stuck at that rate. Only certain people “qualified” for a raise. Where as other call centers start lower and everyone gets a raise at certain periods of their career. Cigna did not do so. Also, there is no advancement so be careful with goals to advance and high expectations. They need people on the phones so that is where you’ll be. Management was awful, hardly around. Our manager was hired from outside of the company so he didn’t even know how to use the programs to help when we had questions. Scheduling is a lie, you’re brought in told you’ll work a specific schedule and no weekends but as soon as training ended all our schedules were changed with rotating weekends added. Call volume wasn’t high so you had a lot of down time during the day. Building was very well kept and up to date. Clean restrooms, desk area was spacious."
bad,"When I started working at Cigna I enjoyed my job, I enjoyed working as a team, they started making changes to who we report to and it went downhill fast, they started demanding more adding items that were unrealistic it became stressful tot he point I had to leave to save my sanity"
bad,"Working without resources is typical of this organization. I learned how to be a Trangressional Manager (which is bad). Management is mentally, verbally, and emotionally abusive. The culture is very negative and hostile. The hardest part of the job is working without adequate resources. There was nothing enjoyable about this job."
bad,"Very, Very, stressfull not by customer calls. By management and co workers. Co workers not able to ask questions to one another. Its FORBIDDEN"
bad,Management does not treat everyone fairly!
bad,"If you know your job, some people are threaten so they find away to get you release from your job. The people I worked with were great but others were not. Management only follows what there friends tell them not from what is true. If you don't ki$$ up to them. they will cut you and gut you and they never look back so the money was good benefits good .. some coworkers evil..  if you get the job watch your back .. really watch your back.   "
bad,"Managing doctor's offices in the Cigna STAR program (quality measures)"
bad,"This place will have you working multiple departments, but will not pay you for doing so. You will work in Customer Service but they will have you taking pharmacy, billing, claims, appeals, grievance phone calls when they have those departments. They do not properly train you, but will criticize you for mistakes. They do not care if you’re sick and laying in the hospital you will still get an occurrence. They treat people like numbers. The supervisors sit around and gossip about their"
bad,"Very toxic,negative and stressful place to work.the managers do not have any clue of what they doing,and apply the worst decisions.salary so low comparing to the workload,if there was less then 1 star rating,i would vote 0 stars.the managers pick enployees and progressing them only by the ass licking level every morning.whoever cannot be an ass licker,stays behind and very bitter.there cannot be any worse place to work then that.i don't want to be disrespectful,but i prefer to work in cleaning Cigna toilet,then actually to work in the company itself.shame shame shame."
bad,The training at Cigna was the worst I have ever experienced. The job that was described to me at my interview was not the job I did. I don't know if it was deliberately misleading or not but the job in no way resembled what was described to me before taking the job. When I voiced my concerns I was completely ignored.
bad,"i am being forced to write this.  Cigna was for me no fun, just a means to put food on the table for my family.  There were 1 or maybe 2 co-workers that were true friends."
bad,"Heavy workload, too few staff for amount of work, off site management often presents issues, company has been on sanctions imposed by CMS, very stressful environment"
bad,"The worse experience EVER! I've worked for some of the BEST companies EVER and this has been by far the worse experience EVER! Micromanaged by inexperienced coaches that were on a fast track into management, ineffective training, reduced training coming out the shoot! High stressed and unconcerning upper management . I had to resigned because this position was inconducsuve to my health."
bad,"Cigna was a challenge to work for.  The first weeks working for this company was in a classroom setting for eight hours a day.  The company would go over a lot of information regarding their company and the job.  "
bad,"This was a good company to work for , I enjoyed the professional environment  and great leadership. I enjoyed working in an office setting, with the computer being able to be on a professional level. While working with customers."
bad,This company is not an employee friendly company. Working as an employee vs. an independent contractor was always an issue as to who got jobs and who didn't
bad,"Seriously, don’t go any apply. They make it seem promising and like they want you to succeed but really they trap you, don’t care about you or how you are treated  they care more about call volume and that’s it. An absolute nightmare trying to move up. Please, spare yourself."
bad,I was a contractor and got all I could for 4 years out of them financially.  Middle management is very cutthroat. They stress work life balance but in reality it's all BS.
bad,"Horrible management,  never go to the call center! You are signing on to be miserable. You get treats such as candy mailed to your house, or batteries that they later recall!"
bad,"The work in and of itself was not bad, neither was Cigna."
bad,"Cigna is too big of a corporation, they dont care about their employees.  "
bad,Nothing Positive to add-would not recommend. Does not pay what the same positions pay in area. Expects you to expand knowledge base with constantly adding responsibilities
bad,Training is lacking.  In class for 3 weeks then thrown on floor and expected to know everything even if you weren't trained on it.   Continually added more responsibilities without training.  If you question the quality review feedbacks they fire you.  Bad place to work treat temps like dirt. On employee appreciation day they provided lunch for all of the permanent employees but not the temps.  Pretty sad since they depend on the temps to get the work done during open enrollment.
bad,This is not a good nursing home they keep the people that are not good at their job and they get rid of the good workers.
bad,"Training was very fast paced and did not really grasp the concept of the job. Once training was completed; the culture of the environment did not foster one of support or hands on assistance from leadership. Leadership was very disengaged from the job when it came to assisting on calls, taking escalated issues with priority. There is no onsite HR representative and that advantage is taken."
bad,Poor management that did not listen to staff  - very one sided   Management not staff supportive. Not compensated for extra hours worked.  Understaffed for job expectations
bad,"Not a place to work. They do not care about you but only about their job getting done. They lie about at work jobs, but that is only if they like you."
bad,I've worked at Cigna for a long time.  I love the employees that work there but struggle to advance and with the management.  I don't feel that there is a lot of job security.   I also find the demands and work life balance to have become less and less over the years with not a lot of value for the hours and hours the employees put in.
bad,This was a temp job for me. Training went well and was easy to keep up with. At times they ask way to much with mandatory OT. They did not work with home life.
bad,"You have to log onto 7 systems at the beginning of your shift (9 if you count your email and im). Have to log out of Cisco just to go to bathroom(personal time) Max time is 5min. Your time is monitored, your calls are monitored (sometimes the clicking noise is so loud from them listening to your call, you can barely hear the customers. The training is ineffective. The management definitely has favorites. Extend your contract, to only switch the hours on you and it's oh well, deal with it (however this job was taken do to the schedule worked for my family and I). It's definitely a numbers place."
bad,"Tyrant management, inexcusable decision making, low moral, no advancement, no compensation for hard work, but management get all the bonuses. Company is under sanction for another 2 more years."
bad,"I think working for Cigna was busy and difficult. The management was unfair and didn't listen to you, It was a horrible place to work and business to work for."
bad,"I worked for the company for 2 years and then had some medical issues arise. They terminated me and I applied for unemployment then they fought it saying I quit my job and fought it every step of the way. Working for the company there is no room for advancement unless you are friends with a manager, the benefits are horrible compared to the customers you help, and they take no consideration on how much you help a customer it is more about how long you are on the call or how many you take in a day."
bad,"I worked for the company for less than a year and it was the most stressful job I ever had.  I was working Saturdays and sometimes holidays just to meet a ridiculious deadline. Although my manager was great, her supervisor was not.  In fact when he gathered us into the conference room to annouce they were laying off the entire department, he never said thanks for all the hard work.  He was a real jerk.  I really enjoyed working with the great people that were there and even the President of the Alabama division was very approachable and nice.  However the TN corporate management was full of jerks."
bad,Never run out of work.
bad,"Work culture designed for metrics and bean counting. Cigna really deserves unionized employees AEB more work less pay. Typical corporate greed. I understand being a producer, but Cigna is a user.  Cigna says they have excellent work culture and favor their employees AEB more work,  less compensation. Unfortunately most roads lead to Cigna."
bad,Sr Contracting Analyst... I contact Dental Offices for High Priority Clients on a daily basis. The job could be great if the Senior Management wasn’t absolutely horrible. Managers are new and scared to say anything to the Senior Manager. So much hiring of friends and so much favoritisms it’s crazy! They fill positions with their friends and don’t even let others know the positions are available.
bad,"It was a fantastic place to work in 2009, but I don't know what happened, but it became a place I was no longer proud to work for. I cringed having to go to work. Management was micromanaging and there was often no support provided. I'm not sure if it's changed, but it's not a place I would recommend others working due to my experience."
bad,"Clinical staff members are only treated well if they hold RN licensure. Health educators and behavioral health managers have been demoted for not holding RN licensure, and are paid significantly less money for the same work. I do not recommend a clinician work for Cigna unless they are an RN, which is sad and very unfair. A company that large should know better and value its talent. There are many reasons why I left in a heartbeat."
bad,"All positions start at 12:30 to 9PM. It is hard to get off this shift. The supervisors are helpful but the team leads are not. The team leads are very lazy and one loves to gossip about everyone the other is very negative. The team leads do not help as they are supposed to rather tell you to look it up in the SOP (standard operating procedure) but they are very difficult to read. "
bad,"High stress atmosphere, especially in the fall and winter.  Health insurance benefits weren't that good, considering they are a health insurance company."
bad,Management challenges were present. Supervisor treated many employees unfairly while giving other employees special treatment. No paid time off and no paid holiday time off.
bad,"Could have been a great position. Unfortunately, the culture at that time was one that stated, I MUST have a collage degree no matter how much previous experience I had. The company had a rule that stated ALL staff MUST have a collage degree. That rule made it impossible to advance my career with them. I am so happy that is NOT the way people look at you today when it comes to potential, and ability."
bad,I worked at Cigna for 3.5 years the thing is most people stay to try and help people but the company is brutal on its front line employees unless your management it sucks to work here co workers can be good they help with moral which for the most part is in the crapper most of the time. your micro-managed to the point its insane it is difficult to give the customers the service they truly deserve because of the metrics they impose are unrealistic to say the least. on the surface it looks great nice facilities employee rec area quiet rooms all of that but they make sure you never have time to use these facilities they are just for show for the most part and for them to be an insurance company the insurance package SUCKS.
bad,"Cigna is an amazing place to work at, great people always happy to help when being trained."
bad,Processing refunds in claims department.  Ridiculously unrealistic Work load.  Interesting work but they asked too much. Procedures always benefited the company but software workarounds created even more work for employees. Company was so large that it was nearly impossible to work between departments. I'm sure some departments were good places to work but not there it was all about incoming revenue and shiny charts and graphs. Every key stroke was monitored in the name of efficiency.
bad,Management changes on a regular basis. Not open to changes or new ideas. Challenges with finding new opportunities. Not a collaborative environment. Unclear expectations of employees.
bad,This company is fat and poorly run business. Leadership does not reply on data/history to make business decisions. Instead their decision making process is based on conscientious.
bad,It was a cool place as far as thr co workers. I did nothave any issues with mu co workers we had fun working together.  It is upper management particularly the support magnagers who needs work with how he communicates with his staff. He needa to actually stand up for the people under him.  And actually listen to his staff instead of saying no.
bad,"Never intended to leave cigna, but glad I did as the job was to stressful, Cigna impacted my health as the stress and back stabbing was to much. Would love to find the same type of job soon"
bad,"Cigna fronts as a company that cares about it's employees, but much of the workforce is outsourced overseas and work expectations for FTEs is relentless hours that foster the opposite of good health and life/work balance that Cigna brags about.  The environment is toxic from mid-leadership down.  "
bad,Handling fall outs for clients and doctors that have not had their claims taken care of or processed due to something missing or not included to be able to complete the process.
bad,At the time I was at this company Nepotism was rampant and I have heard still is. If you don't know someone or kiss someones butt you will not get moved around and will be stuck in your job.
bad,"Fairly Good Company With Some Thing's That needs to be changed."
bad,"If you are seeking a diverse company that believes in equal opportunity please seek elsewhere.  I would pursue another company if you are looking for diversity and equal opportunity.  If this is not an issue this is the company for you!  Benefits are okay, if you don't mind paying large sums out of your pocket.  Excellent tuition reimbursement program."
bad,The Cigna Phoenix office location utilizes a large volume of temporary or contract associates so once someone has been trained they leave the company for a permanent position. I think this is the only insurance company around that isn't paperless. Every task is monitored and you must meet daily and weekly metrics. Cigna recently moved processes to their global counterparts in India so that added another layer of confusion and job loss for some. I would say with the Anthem deal still being worked out that Cigna will be in for another major change. Not sure what standards the recruiters are using to attract the most talented claims managers; that appears to be a mystery. I would say any job promotions are available to those that have a supportive supervisor that is willing to let them move to the next level and timing.
bad,"A typical day at work involves cold calling members of the RAC to sell them accident insurance. You do this from the start of your shift until the end. You will take hundreds of calls and read from a overly long script. You'll also have to get the customer to give you your bank details, over the phone, at the end of the sale, and most people don't want to in this, in this day and age, esp when you called them. "
bad,"Uncertain future of company overall. New management in proposal department, work life balance and job culture has plummeted. Would not recommend the move."
bad,"You will be yelled at and threatened on the phone most of the day by customers who don't understand how insurance works. As a CSA, you are the punching bag of the company. Management is usually too busy to help you, ongoing training is a joke, and they constantly make changes. You will be glued to the phone for 8 hours a day, they will also force overtime on you and don't care if you have children that need to be picked up at a certain time."
bad,"I loaded facility and ancillary contracts into 3 different systems for payment purposes.  I learned the many different ways that procedures can be billed and different coding.  My co-workers were pleasant and I enjoyed working with them,  Management was ok.  Loading contracts is a very hard and tedious process and I honestly didn't enjoy doing it at all.  I enjoy person to person interaction vs. person to computer."
bad,This employer says the customer is the most important thing in our job and that we should be centered on the customer but then pushes unreal call times. I took verbal abuse from customers and was told I was wrong for telling a customer if she continued to yell I could not help her. I absolutely hated this job and had to go to therapy.
bad,Typical work day is assisting customer set up claims and taking calls on a constant basis with managers sending emails getting upset on why you don't respond immediately and don't put the customers first. The managers keep always changing the rules and don't relay new policy information correctly and what they do relay is usually wrong because they are just guessing. If you miss a break or are late for lunch you basically lose that free time of your day. The only enjoyable  part of the job are the people who actually go through the daily struggle with you but even they are slowly going away.
bad,"Handle special request from customers requiring manual work. Assisting customer inquiries daily, making sure information and benefits were explained clearly. While working with Cigna I learned the better half of the insurance business  for helping others picking out plans.  "
bad,"High patient care work-flow. Multiple areas of caring for patient needs. Too high of turnover of employees who care for patients. Doctors, nurses, front Office Administration do not stay in current jobs."
bad,This was not a good place to work if you're looking for a career.
bad,Not worth working here. Training needs a over haul and the management just care about numbers( surveys- icms ) if you didn't meet they bombard you on how to improve stats when training was 6 weeks long. The management is mediocre at best.
bad,When Cigna took over there was an incentive but they cut that then lowballed future employees. Nepotism was practiced. Untrained employees were brought in at a higher pay than seasoned employees. Promotions were based upon whether or not the manager liked you not whether you were qualified.
bad,Cigna's Bethlehem PA office is the perfect example of
bad,"The training was subpar at best it didnt truly accurately provide a typical day. Liked the challange.Did not like the games that management plays, there were things that were initially offered. Management took them off of the table. Too many variables to managements attitudes either passive agressive or bluntly rude depending on which manager you are dealing with.. The hardest part was getting how the benefits are applied based on the documentation provided. Learning how to fix the benefit plans, from the various reports that you were not told about or trained how to research and adjudicate them. Grateful for the experience. Love the people that work in Phoenix, a great team. Durng crunch time October thru Feb too much emphasis on manditory overtime, there is no work life balance. They may tell you that it is useless rhetoric the concept is poltically correct..."
bad,Started at the start of this year - management have no empathy for their staff or show any care towards them unless they’re a favourite or friends with them. Was told I had to leave any medical conditions at the door and when a family member was critically ill was told that it was disrupting my work. No chance for improvement and all they care about is statistics not the people taking calls. If you card about your mental health do not work there it’s not worth the little pay you get
bad,After working there I can honestly say it started out great the first few years and over time it bacame a micro management atmosphere.an an fair environment for the employees.
bad,"You are hired on to believe you will have all the time needed to help resolve the customers problems. Also, that there would be room for advancement to other jobs within the company after a year on the phones.  In new hire training you are told your manager will help you set up a career plan to help you grow with Cigna. All of this is false. First of all, they are putting time restrictions on calls. It didn't start out that way but it is that way now. Also, you can't even take a potty break without getting in trouble. You are micromanaged until you can no longer breathe. Only a few people and usually the ones that know someone already within the company get to advance to other positions. It doesn't matter how well you do your job or how much education you have, once you are on the phones it is difficult to get off of them. Also, don't believe the days and hours you are hired on to work. They will change those on you at anytime. Think you don't have to work weekends, ever. Think again.  I get a new manager every 6 months so management does not have time to help you with your career path/goals. Management doesn't have time to learn your name before you end up with a new one. Management doesn't help like you are led to believe in new hire training."
bad,"Overly critical environment with fake leadership, who are only out for themselves, prepare to work yourself into the ground for no reward only criticism. Would not recommend, way better Insurance Companies out there."
bad,I learned  a few things there I learned how to process claims on the 5 years that I was there and now I can go anywhere and do insurance processing claims
bad,I use to love my job been working here for 4 years and now I’m looking for other employment because the new management here the worst. They don’t know how to manage a team they just micro manage all day everyday but can’t answer a simple work question they are just on a power trip.
bad,"Cigna is a great company overall, but the customer service center is very stagnant. It is difficult to advance at this company. I wish I had more opportunities to learn new things."
bad,As you advance up the organizational chart you will see the women drop off.  At lower levels it's 80% women and 20% men.  As you move up to higher paying positions and management it becomes 80% men and 20% women. That says it all.
bad,"We were working on average around 60 hours per week, and because we were salary, we didn't get paid any more than if we worked 40. The work atmosphere was miserable. I truly enjoyed my job there when it was HealthSpring, but it quickly went down hill as soon as Cigna took over. I'll never get all the time I wasted working for them, and lost seeing my child during that time."
bad,"Overall CIGNA was a company involved in the community, cared about the Employees and one of the best Insurance companies around.  Excellent benefits.  The workplace was relaxed and had plenty of space in the cubicles, a gym, a nurse, and large conference rooms for meetings.  I spent the last 2 1/2 of my 12 1/2 years working from home which was really nice."
bad,Their is not much room for advancement no matter you education or skill set. The job is repetitive and I want a career not a job. I believe if I stay working there I would be like other that have been work there for 20 years in the same seat.
bad,"Sueldo bajo, imposibilidad de promoción si no le haces tartas de chocolate al jefe. Vergonzoso"
bad,"I enjoyed helping people and I found that I worked well under pressure and with well defined goals (stats requirements).  I learned a lot about the healthcare industry and as a result of working at Cigna, am now a proponent of natural healing in place of filling my body with toxic chemicals."
bad,This company would be good for someone who is entry level and still in school. I would not recommend for someone who is desiring a career path. Not much room for growth here.
bad,"There were definitely a lot of pros being a Cigna employee but probably more cons."
bad,"My reviews speak for themselves, I have nothing further to add about my time at Cigna.  The pay was competitive, other factors leave much to be desired."
bad,"No opportunity to advance and annual salary increases are paltry with no chance of earning a bonus.  Management looks out for the company only and will throw an employee under the bus at the drop of a hat."
bad,Cigna could be a good place to work if the culture was important to Sr Leadership. Often people are humiliated on calls. There is little accountability and that starts with leadership not clearly outlining what is expected of employees.
bad,"Have worked for Cigna now for well over 10 years. In my particular department the majority of people are chronic complainers, lazy and downright dumb. The managers who manage these people do no real, actual work whatsoever other than assigning work to other people and then year end reviews. I have no idea how a manager in this place would fill up 8 hours a day and many colleagues have wondered the same thing. "
bad,My experience at Cigna was a great learning experience as it was my first exposure to a large corporate environment. It helped me to determine my perspective pertaining to how I wanted to focus my career.
bad,"Enjoyed working with my colleagues. Our benefits weren't the best and the pay was horrible even after being bought out from a smaller company, Cigna took over and started cleaning house and eliminating as many positions as possibly to save the company money. We were told not to worry, business. Is booming! Current employees are under pay while new hires get pay more."
bad,"Cigna wasnt a great place to work. I was brought in to an enviroment that was supposed to have a training class. That never happened,, The girl that was supposed to train us backed out and I was just put out there to work on live products.. No training was provided."
bad,"Cold calling customers during eastenders is the last thing people want to sell a product they don't even need."
bad,"Although some may like sitting in a room in their house all day taking calls, I did not. I had to sit in one place for sometimes 10 hours a day. Only two breaks were allowed and they had to be approved. The training was not very educational when it came to what your job actually was. I had to learn how to navigate the system on my own."
bad,"Very Poor Management.  Job description, impossible to "
bad,Every aspect of your day was timed. At the end of each day you had to give an explanation if you went over the  time given to complete the claim.
bad,"I feel this is a great organization, with some benefits that are good. If you get the right role and leadership you should do well. If not its hard not to fail"
bad,Its a good work place for a college student or a summer job placement for a young adult fresh out of school. I dont have anything else to state.
bad,"it was a place to work management had no concern for it  people, job position was not defined, found to be very frustrating. not rewarded monetarily for hard work and supervisor had no idea about the job and refused to learn."
bad,Daily I would mainly be doing data entry for providers and members re: the medications they were approved or denied from us.  I typed letters/correspondences to members and providers.  Made outbound calls to providers for needed information and medicare members.
bad,The job itself was not hard. Unfortunately the training process for the job is non existent. The  access to information needed to do the job effectively hasn't been streamlined yet.  Room for advancement isnt easy.
bad,"You're not rewarded for extra work here. They say they are pay for performance company but they are lying. You are working in a sweat shop and you are micromanaged to the core. As a claim manager, you are basically working in a call center. Everyone that works as a claim manager and hates their job. If you leave on vacation, no one takes care of your desk. There wasn't much to enjoy about tho]is job."
bad,"It was clear after a month that managers only care about your production, and not their employees. When management discontinued bathroom breaks, limited team meetings to once a month for 30minutes I knew I was in trouble. Inaddition to that before you consider calling off sick, you better think twice because it will be counted as an occurrence. 10 occurrences or more and your quickly terminated, and that includes tardy's, leaving early for kids appointments, or your own. There are no exceptions to medical emergency's also they are considered unplained, so therefore they are counted as occurrences. Since management doesnt provide sick days for call center reps.  I've worked for the company 3 years and haven't received any acknowledement from management about my tenure...not even an e-mail. I work 10 hour days which entitled me for 3 breaks but that was quickly reduced too two breaks to ensure we have proper coverage. Customers are constantly angry due long hold times  to reach a CSA. The company doesn't provide on- line bill pay for their customers therefore contributing to wall to wall calls."
bad,"You begin by speaking to a physician's office or hospital, enter procedures the patient will be receiving, give a case number to be sent over for claims, and read over policy and procedures."
bad,"Unprofessional management, favoritism, too much drama. I don't really have much to say but I would not recommend anyone to work for such catty, unprofessional people. They are the absolute worst."
bad,"Unfortunately I can only say that as a rehire for the past 3 years, this company has not lived up the previous standards that I remembered. Management was not in touch with employees to have an accurate idea of what tools and resources were needed by employees to serve the members in an effective manner. I would not return to the company."
bad,I've been with Cigna for 7years now and I haven't been able to advance from csr. This job is nice for someone about to retire or as part time but not as a career focus unless that's where you're interest lies.
bad,"Good training provided for customer service role."
bad,"It's happening, and I assume it's not restricted to Cigna: the conditions for technology contract workers are the worst possible, and the culture is turning towards having floating workers whenever needed. I'm seeing complaints in forums about not being able to find permanent jobs anymore. It's very convenient for companies, but a nightmare for most workers (the ones with families, dependents, mortgage and college loans), considering most of us have regular bills and now we need to survive with an irregular workflow and pay. And with close to no benefits: no paid vacation, leave or PTO. Management changes in the company make things even worse, and supervisors can't make all the changes they want. There's close to no possibility of getting promoted to a permanent position, no career path and complete disregard for one's need to having full-time work."
bad,"CIGNA is not what everyone in management makes it out to be. Micromanaging at its finest! It’s a very stressful job. I’m not sure why people stay there. Now if you don’t know anything about insurance/ healthcare field they will train you. Training is about 14 weeks long and you can’t miss a day, or you will fall way behind. Advancement is based on if management likes you or not. Favoritism is very present as well as low diversity in management/corporate.  I only gave compensation/benefits a 3 star cause of the 401k match, and the discounts you get through the job. All I have to say is that if you want to be looked over, monitored daily. Apply and good luck."
bad,"This was a horrible experience. The training and management were jokes, I was totally unprepared after training and watched my fellow new hires drop like flies. The insurance they offered was inadequate and expensive, the irony was not lost on me. I would never work for another insurance company again. I was reticent because I think they are evil, Turns out I was right. If you like being yelled at by patients with terminal brain cancer who can't afford their pain meds then this is the job for you!"
bad,I have no review of this company. I was laid off within a year of being offered a position with the company. Overall I did like the people I worked with
bad,This company was not a very good company for someone that is looking for room for advancement.  I found that no matter how hard you worked there was not room for advancement.
bad,"Work from home option is great. Working in a team environment, with independent result expectations is a great cohesive asset. "
bad,The only real time I talked to my superior was when I had done something wrong that had not been covered in the hurried and incomplete training.  I was pleased to have this as a stepping stone job on my way to a new one.  I continue to look for a better fit.
bad,"Management did not support their teams or other managers"
bad,"Very stressful environment.  Not much support from management or leadership.  No accountability.  The expectations are high, but there is really no direction.  When leadership is put on the spot, everyone else has to pay."
bad,I worked there almost five years the job required you to pay ninety claims a day and take ninety calls a day we were paid by our quality of work and it was extremely stressful to do all times
bad,"The company as a whole is good.  management is lacking, they are not on the same page. Favoritism is rampant in this company.  The worst thing about it is most of the time you immediate supervisor is in another state.  The training is sketchy and your go to tools are not user friendly.  The people I work with are great!!!  The cafeteria is nice.  But management and training is terrible in my department (Medical Referrals and Authorizations)."
bad,Too much to even state.   I really do believe that some of the middle managers must have incriminating information/photos on some of the upper management - or they wouldn't have a job.
bad,it was great when i first started but once Illinois stopped contract everything change and job came to an end management was in another stated and we rarely had it in our office
bad,"Learned to enter claims into system."
bad,"Cigna worker's work as a team, everyone helps, manager's are easy to talk to if you need any kind of help. Must have computer and phone expert. Nice place to work"
bad,My manager did not provide the necessary coaching to help me succeed in my role. Cigna underpays the staff and does not care about the employees well being.
bad,"they do not care about their employees, the managers are hardly managers, i would never work here again. you go through all these weeks of training but once you hit the floor, you deal with stuff you havnt even been trained on."
bad,"Extremely Hard work and no appreciation for it. You will work a lot of overtime if you work in the Field and Never get compensated or appreciated for it. They really don't care about you, just the numbers and how hard you can work. You have no voice or input even though you have mastered things and could help with the daily work flow. Its a shame because I really enjoyed the patients and helping them, but the manager clearly wasn't on the same page."
bad,programs open and close quickly unfortunately because they move so fast.  Very young staff and high turnover.  East coast mentality fast paced environment
bad,"Low pay, but great vacation time.  Constant overtime. Too much micro management. No room for advancement. Reverse discrimination. No advancement opportunities."
bad,The people really make this job somewhat bearable! Trying to get rid of AA and RAC plans to people who didn't realise that they had ticked the box to agree further communication is a really nice way to keep people calm and happy to chat with you. Most of the management team were an absolute joke! Sneaky and no desire to help you do well at your job no real support system there at all just people marching around trying to be more important than they actually are! Going in at 1 and putting your headset on is difficult when you don't feel any sort of unity by anyone. The scripts were utter tripe and coming back after lunch (5 o' clock) was the most painful thing on a summers evening! It's not a good job to have unless you're a student or single and don't mind getting in near ten at night after being shouted at and bullied by customers with no support from your managers!
bad,"Performed pharmacy appeals. However, the department was poorly managed, did not predict the volume of appeals and were not prepared to handle the volume. Mandatory overtime for 3 out of 4 months I worked there. Requirement was 8 cases per day when I started and by the 1st month, the requirement was 15 case per day. I was able to complete 25-30 cases per day, however other staff (employed 2+ years) would only do 2-6 cases per day and there was no overall team goal for everyone to work together."
bad,"Census overload! 12-14 hour work days, including weekends just to get caught up for the week.  Working from home has its pros/cons. I enjoy my working relationship with hospital case managers and physicians."
bad,It's a great place to learn and grow.  More work at home opportunities. There are a few really good managers and opportunities to work on projects. A good start at least to grow into something else
bad,Expect to work hard and beyond regularly scheduled hours. All employees are generally type A personalities. This employer will give you the opportunity to learn and grow in your field of expertise/interest.
bad,"it was not a hard job,  if you like being on the phone all day this is the job for you.  Cigna doesnot plan to hiring anyone. Everyone I talked to there were under temp agencies, They let the temps go with no warning or explanation.   I got a phone call from MindLance on my way home from work, telling me in a message not to go back the next morning and to contact my manager at Cigna to pick up my things.  She told me nothing as to why. But said I had to talk to MindLance who said they were told only that I was not up to standard, The same thing happened to one of co-workers the very same day. The last thing my manager said to me was that everything was going good."
bad,People who just started the job were managers so the company was not being ran correct. Your Schedule Constantly changes without your knowledge.
bad,"The hours are very flexible and allow for you to pick your schedule if you work in the claims department. However,  you are often micro-managed by a specific office manager, regardless of whether you are on her team or not, and it creates a very stressful and unwanted atmosphere. If you don't mind repetitive data entry then you should be good to go as long as you can produce over 50 claims a day with out a single error. In short, very stressful but not impossible."
bad,Terrible impression of Cigna. I was not trained properly in my line of work. I communicated to my manager several times concerning my poor training and requested additional training only to be denied the opportunity to be coached or receive additional training. I was employed with Cigna four months before I resigned.
bad,A diario se tomaban muestras de los baños electrolíticos para ser análizados y mantenerlos en óptimas condiciones. Aprendí a elaborar gráficas X-R. Se tenía muy poco contacto con el personal administrative. La parte más difícil del trabajo era la imposición religiosa. Lo que más me gusto fue el rspeto adquirido entre la base obrera y su cooperación para realizer mi trabajo.
bad,"•A typical day at work"
bad,Answer the call and get off the phone within 3 mins regardless if the customer understands what you told them about their healthcare.
bad,"so far its okay , the hours are very long, and very hard to get PTO."
bad,"Answer phones, adjust claims, fax, email communications."
bad,"A typical day at Cigna in the Utililization Management Department is overwhelming.  This is an inbound call center that receives calls from members and providers.  Calls are constantly misdirected to precert when they need to be sent to benefits and eligibility. Because these are SAR (Shared Administrator Accounts), Cigna does not house any of that information. Callers are very frustrated and aggravated with the way the calls are handled and the hold time, sometimes 20 minutes, to be told they've reached the wrong number. You have a great team of co-workers, that assist one another when they are trained properly. Management is not very resourceful in additon to the Resolution Team."
bad,"As a call center employee, if you do your job well, you are rewarded with more calls.  You are expected to take as many as possible which leads to a high burnout rate.  CIGNA fires many of its less desirable employees, mostly in the summer and then has a huge hiring push each fall.  "
bad,"its a cool place the people are nice your typical day is taking calls from customers and researching claims and reprocessing claims, as of late been mandated to reach out to Doctors offices to resolve incorrect billing."
bad,"I have to say, after reading the reviews from other sites and offices I have determined it must just be Scranton, Pa that is the problem child in the company. The management teams are unprofessional in having impromptu conversations with their direct reports about where they are going on the weekends (which is against Cigna policy, no?). It's also alarming that these individuals are the ones who get the promotions and raises each year while everyone else honestly just seems to get a lot of negative feedback. They need an organizational restructuring and some discipline on the management team regarding their socialization at work. It was a highly unprofessional situation. The benefits were terrible. One person can not afford a $2000 deductible on their own. Sorry, Cigna. You're not a place of caring or continuity. The only thing I'm glad I took away from there is a plethora of knowledge regarding the insurance industry which I can use at a more pleasant establishment. "
bad,"separate papers and stuck them in arranged way, i learned if i am irresponsible and reckless i could stay longer in this company and many other companies. dealing with management was the hardest part. the most enjoyable part was listening to other people experiences in beginning of their life and how easy they could back on track even when they made huge mistakes."
bad,"On the phone constantly helping people(which I loved)! Learned a lot about insurance and the negative and positives about it! Management lacked communication skills, professionalism, motivation and positive reassurance towards employees! Hardest part was giving bad news to customers and making since of their benefits for them. Loved my co-workers and helping others."
bad,"The pay was good but the hours it was too late for me and some what far it was through a temp agency and the time it was for 4,5 months only but mainly it was the hours"
bad,All they care about is the customer not the employees and their metrics are not attainable which makes for high stress levels. The turnover rate is ridiculously high and you get in trouble if you’re sick and miss work for more then 3 days and this is a HEALTH insurance company.
bad,"Cigna has a passive aggressive culture. People will agree with you in meetings and then work against you in private. I had a manager who sat through strategy meetings, listened and agreed to the proposals when we voted, then went back to his market and implemented his own programs. When confronted he said he never agreed."
bad,Manager was based out of her home in Houston.  She couldn't travel and had a dislike for Hispanic people.  She didn't like you if you had an opinion and you were NOT encouraged to speak up.  Micromanagement at its finest and lack of respect for the employees.
bad,"The workdays were long"
bad,"Hired as contract Hedis review nurse, we were placed in an open room at a table with multiple computers, with no privacy from other temp/contract personnel"
bad,"Although, this was a temporary assignment, I was never made to feel  as though I was part of the team nor was I provided appropriate training on internal Cigna procedures."
bad,Policies and procedures are always changing within the company. They always talk about how easy it is to move up within the company but that is false/
bad,"Don’t care if you have medical issues with you or your kids. Will terminate even if you have a doctors notice stating why you were out or have to be out. They will still terminate. If you are sick and vomiting, they will keep you on the phones unless you just leave on your own accord so they can use that against you."
bad,"Cigna Cigna Cigna,"
bad,this was good because you got to make you own hours. however u had to go far use your own gas and vehicle. no benefit which was not good. if your looking for a career
bad,Typical call center environment if you been to one you been to them all if you like answering phones meeting metrics and getting treated like high school go for it
bad,"A Anvers, il n'y a que les flamands qui sont privilégiés. On recrute certains qui ne parlent même pas Français et bien l'Anglais alors qu'il y en a des centaines qui répondent bien au profile. Ceux qui occupent des fonctions manageriales et d'origine non flamande ne font même pas 1 %. Les ressources humaines, 100% flamands."
bad,I was contracted to set up a program office and completed this in the time allowed and then moved on to another assignment. Very bureaucratic management style holding back the companies performance.
bad,"- People are friendly but departments have hard time to collaborate"
bad,"needs improvement in management and career opportunities, with a clear path for advancement local /regional talent..,............................................................"
bad,Not that great of a call center. Convergys is too focused on following these minute rules that are really difficult to follow. They are not merciful at all.
bad,"This was a temporary job, unsure of what that do in a permanent status, nice employees, good trainjng, lots of overtime available during peak season. It was ok"
bad,"The culture in the location where I worked was dog-eat-dog.  Maybe it is different elsewhere.  Very clique-ish, and if you fit in, you will go far, if you are wiling to compromise your principles to do so."
bad,Could not find another position at Cigna. I went by the book in applying for other jobs. I should have done more networking. Qualifications should be the main criteria in getting another position.
bad,I have previous Customer Service experience with a well name company. Cigna's emphasis was on quantity not quality. Customers were dissatisfied with the service or lack there of.
bad,"relaxed environment, mangers not engaged enough, HealthSpring is big difference from Cigna Cigna, but I enjoy my position wish it was a set work for me"
bad,"A typical day at work is busy. "
bad,"Cigna acquired QualCare in Piscataway and it's not what you will expect. it may be under Cigna but QualCare management stayed the same. They will tell you about expectations and what they publish as your role as UR nurse, but once you're hired, that's another story. You will be given 2 hrs x2 days/wk, 8 hrs x1 day /wk for you to perform your duties as a UR nurse. The remaining hours? you will be working as intake coordinators- a job being paid in hourly rate. some nurses will be required to do the late schedule (4:30pm-6pm) to be as intake coordinator, not as a nurse. you will be in the phone all the time to answer intake calls, and you are expected to stop doing your nursing reviews to take the calls which are non stop. and another thing, if you are an RN and applying for this job, $2/hr difference on your salary with the LPNs."
bad,Your day consisted of entering in written prescriptions from patients to be filled for mail order. There was good training for the position.  But very detail oriented.
bad,"Nice people, just a lot of stress.  There are allot of empty"
bad,"Typical day at work was getting ready to approve and process 80 faxes from providers a day, for Prior Authorization.  I learned how to process and approve authorization. Management was okay."
bad,I worked from home but I got sick and needed several surgeries and then put on medical leave. CIGNA would not work with my doctors appointments so they let me go
bad,"This was a great start for my career. I learned a lot from Cigna including data management, scheduling, and communication skills. I would recommend this job to an entry level beginner."
bad,When hired you were promised a full time position which was not true. The people hired where there to catcv the company up and then let go.
bad,"Inside phone sales,Medicare Advantage Plans.  Extreme juggling of tasks all day. Workplace culture good. Long hours. Good co workers. Free lunches, , good immediate supervisor."
bad,"No flexibility , promised all sorts by CEO to ensure retention of nurses but the nurse managers made sure everything failed , they allowed the trial to tick the box , then pulled the plug for no good reason."
bad,"a typical day at work consisted of taking inbound calls from very upset clients because case managers would not return their calls regarding their claims, poor management, some co-workers goof offed while others worked, hardest part handling angry customer no customer service."
bad,"Insurance benefits are horrible, never rewarded for your efforts, hard to move up in the company and when you do move up you are taken advantage of."
bad,"Most  if not all of the QualCare / MEWA Sales ""Managers, Directors"" do nothing but delegate ridiculous projects and spend time in meetings after meetings. They are a joke."
bad,"the employer is very bad at managing the store, she was migrating at the time. reason i quit the job was because she didn't listen to me and kept selling smokes to underage people."
bad,"produce produce produce"
bad,"While I loved my coworkers, and some of the claims managers we helped support, the company overall was awful to work for. "
bad,"Very high stress job. The supervisors do not have the experience needed to actually help you with day to day issues. The company is all about how many calls you take and not actually about the quality of service you provide to those customers who are in need.I have worked in HR for many years and never have experienced what I did there. Great place to work if you are young and have not really experienced the work environment. Must be able to handle irate customers and providers on a daily bases. Set amount of time for bathroom breaks. Very production driven based on the amount of calls you take, how long it takes you to handle the call and how long you have them on hold."
bad,"Management was far too removed from the genuine needs and concerns of employees.  There was always pressure for production even at the cost of performance.  Then, the performance was used to evaluate your job performance."
bad,Good team people environment. Learned about healthcare plans and programs. Best part of my job was working in a team environment.
bad,...not much to say about this place. Good environment. Ok benefits. Too much micromanagement. No room for growth. Absolutely no room for growth
bad,"Challenging work environment with limited support from management."
bad,"Doing an exellent job and being courteous to the customer is important , but your performance is measured mainly on how well you score on their ""adhereance scale"". Policy and procedues are constanly changing and one must check their email to be aware of such changes and apply to the job performance.You will be held accountable ."
bad,"customer service"
bad,Management is poor and fosters an environment of favoritism. If you're not a part of the group you're screwed and can be fired at a moments notice for absolutely no reason.
bad,Working for this company helps in maintaining a roof over my head.  Learning everyday how to be creative in handling frustrated people with patience is a must in this company.  Staying humble and knowing it's not about someone appreciating how hard you work but making the customer happy in the end of a sad situation.
bad,"Good work environment, good benefits, great building that was close to my home."
bad,"mandatory overtime, no postitive enforcement, The supervisors are great it is the company overall. Doesnt treat their employee well from my opinion"
bad,"I was promoted supervisor for my knowledge, problem solving and leadership abilities. I learned the insurance realm of nursing. My team of nurses and secretaries were like a family. Teamwork was apparent, hot issues were directed to supervisors to handle."
bad,"Cigna home delivery pharmacy is a terrible place to work. The customers disrespect you all day and management says nothing.  Every thing is about the customer, never about the company's employees. The morale in that place is non-existent.  The supervisor's job is to snoop around everyone's desk all day to check for something they can report back to their boss or your supervisor and turn it into a write up. The company pays well but not that well. There are more employees out on stress leave than at the actual office working. Not a good place to work."
bad,"The training was good, but once on the floor to do your job it was hard to get help with questions.  For the most part people were very friendly, it was just a very stressful atmosphere."
bad,"As international division of Cigna located in Wilmington they offered   coverage to members, working outside or on business trips outside of their home countries for medical, dental and vision. "
bad,"Cigna spends a lot of time and money telling you what a wonderful place it is to work. They work you to death, but the raises are a joke. There was little chance for advancement in my field. They hired me in and a year later they were hiring younger, less experienced people for $3K to $4K per year more. I got a 2% raise after a year!!!! My reviews were exemplary. My co-workers are what made it bearable. Be very careful before going with this company. If I had another choice, I would not choose this company."
bad,Management is poor. Nurse Practitioners are treated like bedside nurses. No respect. Very clickish... I wouldn't wish this job on an enemy.
bad,I worked from home it was a good experience and I save on gas and was able to be at home when my kids got out of school. I interacted with my co workers through a chat group. The hardest part of the job was satisfying the members needs. The most enjoyable part was solving a problem and making someones day.
bad,"A wast of Time, to go through 13 weeks of training and then to come in and find out your job was outsourced.."
bad,"Senior management was lacking in ability to train new associates in what they wanted, unwilling to communicate wants and needs. Lots of times I heard 'this is what I want, do it' only to then be told 'no, I want it this way'....after asking for direction, then making it up myself. If you want the page to be Landscape, 12 point font, with a blue header, then TELL ME when I ask."
bad,You are paid to save lives as a masters level crisis counselor.  You get paid a little more than you would at McDonalds.  Why have the stress and zero pay.  Not worth it.  If you want to work in other areas you get blocked due to favoritism no matter how perfect your background is.  Run as fast as you can.
bad,Training was amazing and i loved my trainers they showed me everything i needed to know once i completed my training i was set to work with all new people and they were not i repeat NOT welcoming at all !
bad,"I achieved my job through an employee whom I had known since High School.  I was hired as an Accounting Specialist. However, the title barely covers the duties it entailed.  What was not mentioned about the person whose job I filled, nor the fact that Cigna Government Services had been audited by CMS and had been given a ""corrective action plan"" two years prior.  "
bad,"very busy and stressful work environment... supervisors never avail to assist on difficult calls, had to transfer to voice mails... very strict on rest room breaks, even for those with ADA due to medical issues... no push or referrals from supervisors to advance, just wanted bodies on the phones.... they advocate wellness and health, but treat dedicated reps that may be ill with little compassion, for example you have a severe soar throat and not able to speak clearly, they still want you on the phones with no consideration for a break or leaving early to recover and get well.... lots of special projects, but only for those that suck up and not really do their jobs consistently"
bad,"The pay is great, however my experience was more disappointing due to change of management and their philosophy for lack of patient care. It was like a weight lifted off my shoulders leaving. They work is overwhelming for one person. They began to lack teamwork."
bad,"It is a Cigna Only culture, no out of the box thinking. If you agree with your supervisor 100% you get to keep your job. Too many people that work there, this was, and is their only job since university 10+ years ago."
bad,My typical day was to stack mails onto the sorting machine and then stack certain mail to certain bins so that they can be shipped out. The hardest part was doing things outside your job.
bad,"Cuándo comienzas a trabajar en Cigna sueles sentir entusiasmo y protección, pero luego todo se va haciendo demasiado monótono y las posibilidades de ascenso son escasas. El trabajo es rutinario y aburrido y la plataforma IT detenida en el tiempo y con muchos errores que luego repercuten en tu productividad. Los superiores no valoran el trabajo individual y recalcan los porcentajes numericos por sobre lo humano. Mucha gente abandona el trabajo por diversos motivos. El sueldo tampoco es de  los mejores. Otra cosa es la distancia. El promedio de empleados dispone de más de 1 hr de viaje para llegar a la zona de trabajo a pesar de la lanzadera que ofrece la emoresa. Es como para hacerlo por un tiempo y que te quede un buen antecedente en el CV."
bad,"I thought that I was being hired as behavioral health case manager and would need to know some medical issues however when I went for the first day, I found that I would be working as case manager for ""the worst of the worst"" members with serious multiple problems. There was no welcome from my managers during the initial training period and I was not introduced to the team I would be working with until after the initial 2 weeks of training. I initially sent an email to my manager saying that I was happy to be there in training and onboard but she never even acknowledged it. During my employment there was no encouragement and no one ever offered to go over any of my cases with me to discuss what I might do to improve or except for the times I was being reviewed. We were discouraged from interacting with other members of the team or staff cases. Negative feedback was about the only feedback most of us received. Turnover rate was very high in my department and staff stayed discouraged and disheartened."
bad,"In all of the years I have been in customer service I have never experienced a company as poorly ran as Cigna. The training, the work load, the expectations, and the inconsideration from management is unbelievable."
bad,If you like phone work this job allows for a LOT of phone work. It also allows for the opportunity to work from home but you are then at the mercy of the company and expected to work even more. Not a lot of flexibility when it came to schedule and time off. But because they were always short staffed OT was mandatory.
bad,"Great coworkers, decent management. Good work life balance, job security. Negatives were low starting pay and lackluster raises. Very stressful job with low compensation made it easy to leave. Compensation not worth the stress"
bad,"Proposal management won't invest in you. They have poor and redundant processes. They don't give you all the tools you need, and they give mixed or incomplete message. However, I do think upper management cares about the happiness of the workers. I suspect departments with less turnover probably have happier workers and better management."
bad,"The band level for my role was underrated. We worked as hard as implementation, client service representatives, and sales team, yet we were treated poorly, underpaid, and rarely recognized for our efforts."
bad,"-some micromanagement"
bad,"The attempted merger with Anthem brought forth a new round of management.  ""Do more with less"" became the guiding principle of the company.  As employees left, positions were not filled.  The burn out rate and employee frustration escalated."
bad,"Managers have chips on their shoulders, some were easy to speak with, some acted as if you were way beneath them and not worth speaking to. I was not happy."
bad,..nothing really bad to say. Cignas a pretty decent company and the fact that they have tuition assistance has helped me out alot. Becuase of them I was able to obtain my bachelor's degree.
bad,"The team that Cigna had working for them wasn't very professional. They  was lying and stilling go on and manager purposely make up stuff just to get brownie points. I tried my best to work with them, but I really couldn't its like they had it in for me. I was telling them I was going to report them after I came off of medical leave that's when they fried me. I still reported it anyway to the better bureau."
bad,"Gave 9 plus years to the company and by the end I was so full of anxiety and panic that I wasn't myself anymore, majorly micromanaged. They will treat you like a number and like you don't matter to them, all they care about is numbers in that place. Multiple systems running at all times and the need to translate a lot of the claims using google but yet they want you to go faster and faster. If you like being stalked and verbally abused this is your place for sure.. oh and god forbid you complain after years of the constant pushing and unrealistic quotas that cause you any physical disabilities cause they will fire you as soon as they can.. beware! I'd never go back but I sure do miss the vacation package."
bad,Worked with Company for 10 years. The work culture became very stressful and turn over became very high. High case load for case manager. Hard to get promoted.
bad,Cigna Healthcare was a very challenging job i have ever had. We had to deny medical claim and i had to expliane to people why they could not have certian life saving procedure due to procdure code.
bad,"Ton of great people to work with but the company itself doesnt always show that employee's matter. Your based off stats and feel like just a number. Everything is micro managed and your time is watched down to the seconds. Ex: you're allowed 5min of ""personal time"" (2) 15min breaks and (1) 30 min lunch."
bad,"Cigna TTK is 3 yrs old company.. It has lot of potential to grow,  it focus on Heath and wellness which is unique,  it's backed by Good products. Needs time to penetrate the Indian market and also to adopt latest changes"
bad,"A typical day at Cigna is dealing with customer concerns, complaints, and inquiries. I realized I do enjoy the healthcare industry ."
bad,"This review is for ALEGIS not Cigna. Recently acquired by Cigna, but, management is the same. There was no WORK LIFE balance for the provider. People sitting in the office probably have a wonderful work life balance. "
bad,"If it weren't for the harassment and unfair treatment that I endured at this company at the hands of management, this would have been the perfect job. I made good money, it was somewhat flexible and the staff was great. I wish that they hadn't hired the people that they did in manager's roles. They have no idea of how to manage. Nor do they know anything about Quality. I hope things get better over there for the ones that are still there"
bad,"A typical day at work consists of being severely micro-managed regardless of exceptional or average performance."
bad,"I worked as a contractor for 6+ months at Cigna and it was hands down the worst experience I have endured thus far in my career. The management does not care about you, you are expected to work insane hours, and be available at the drop of a hat. The technology is anything but cutting edge, it is almost a step back in time. The entire company is rolled in red tape, nothing will get done in a reasonable amount of time, and you are held responsible for things that are not even under your control. If you can't speak Indian you will be left out of many conversations as the majority of The IT workers are Indian. Although they are wonderful to work with and are extremely friendly, at times you just feel left out? Kudos to Cigna for promoting a multicultural team though, that is one thing they have going for them. If you want to advance your IT career, this is not the place to do it. All-in-all, this is your typical big corporation."
bad,You only get a 30 min lunch and two 15 min breaks but they decide when you take them and it may be different depending on the day. They expect you to answer a lot of phone calls and it is a tiring job. Pay isn't great either.
bad,"Although the company promotes diversity, unfortunately this is not practiced. Advancement in this company is possible but your chances are better if you develop a personal relationship with the managers in the sense of nothing is kept confidential about employees' status. This applies to employees with degrees and no degrees. It would appear if you are in a department that is prodominately 1 race, then unless you are of that dominate race, your advancement is not possible and you will have problems. This company does not show sympathy to employees who have lost a loved one unless they are your true friend as this is not consistent across the board."
bad,"In my 4 years at Cigna, I had more desk and management movement than anything.  Some managers were great, others were AWFUL! Benefits were very poor and not cost effective at all! Depends on what team/department you work on.. Employee engagement for some were good, others not at all.  It was a hard place to stay positive!"
bad,"This place is a good job but if your in call, good luck leaving. Most people who do leave have to be buddy buddy with the Supervisor. I quit because HR offered me a position that would advance my career within Cigna but my Supervisor had to sign off on it and guess what? She said, I couldn't be released. They literally tell you in orientation that you can have so many opportunities, and you can, but you need to be very good friends with your boss. Hard work and experience isn't enough for career advancement there."
bad,"Manage T-SQL Code that supported SSIS and SSRS processes"
bad,"I think it would be a great company if they offered better pay when it was time for raises, and also i believe if someone wants to advance to a different department to better their self they should be able to."
bad,"Not the best job management is horrible; poor culture, no job advancement management doesn't have your back they are all about self at Cigna from management to the director"
bad,"The morale was very poor and too much micro managing. Although time off was good, there were too many restrictions as to when one was allowed to take their time off."
bad,"I wouldn’t recommend working in Laredo office cause no one gets hired, only ppl that the mgr knows due to Cigna offers bonus for hired refered ppl... The mgr does the hiring, so it’s always ppl that she knows, even if they are not qualified to do the job."
bad,"I would not recommend working in their support department or as a temp. Restructuring there caused layoffs and the company didn't offer the employees positions elsewhere, they just started hiring temps. Company only values certain employees, but communication is bad everywhere. Management is unorganized and unhelpful, in many cases. The people aren't bad. Opportunities to move up are lacking and recruitment is awful."
bad,"Good, at times it varies.  I worked in Group Operations/Underwriting and had various position.  If not for job elimination, I believe I would still be employed."
bad,"Very political place to work. Tough to survive if you are a middle manager as I was. Pay is decent, but management overall is pretty clueless. Like so many places these days"
bad,"The basic job is to sit in a box, answer a bunch of calls (around 40). "
bad,"Would be a great place to work with all the perks, but management is terrible.  They micro-manage and treat you like a child.  No chance for advancement and management has their favorites for sure.  It is insulting.  The worst place I have ever been employed.  Clock watchers."
bad,"If you are comfortable being micro managed then this is the job for you. No one ever knows what is going on, and there are constant changes! Depending on which supervisor you have, it is highly likely that your work will not be appreciated. There are no protective screens over the monitors to prevent strain on your eyes and headaches, so good luck with that. Lunch is 40 minutes long with no additional breaks in between. You can barely go to the restroom without someone coming to see where you are!"
bad,"Initially, I believed that this would be a great job that would progress to a career.  However, once you leave the classroom training which is fabulous you are kind of in a sink or swim situation.  The coaches almost refuse to take supervisor calls even though you are new.  Depending on your manager you will be talked down to and scolded like a child."
bad,No two days were the same at this company. A typical day consisted of maintaining open lines of communication with primary care physicians and specialist across the city. The hardest part of my job was the local travel that was required. The most enjoyable part of the job was the flexibility.
bad,Middle and senior management go out of their way to make even the individual contributors feel bad about their work.  Little room for creativity even to the point where people are afraid to do their jobs  lest they should be criticized.
bad,"This  experience was great getting my foot in the door. I've learned how things work on a wide scale range in the Pharmacy field, now I would like to expand to a more one on one in a hospital field."
bad,"Way too much work for what you were getting paid. Management doesn't help the customer service rep as much as they should. Other departments slack off and we were to get the brunt of the anger from the customers. There are different departments that are to handle different subjects, but it the work always seemed to fall back on the customer service rep. Again, way too much work place on the customer service rep and not enough recognition."
bad,"Lacks Structure at times, but for the most part not a bad place to work. People are friendly at time a little unprofessional but that's just in the call center."
bad,"I have worked here for 5+ years. Working in business operations has been a task the past 1.5 years and a complete bore the previous 4. There's no comprehensive training for new hires, information is all over the place and rapidly changing. One day one thing is right, the next it's wrong. Teamwork and the sense of a team atmosphere (which is CRUCIAL for success in the department) is nowhere to be seen. If anything people would prefer to put others down and call out their mistakes rather than lend a hand to help. Compensation is terrible. There have been promises of bonuses and merit based incentives. I've seen no bonuses and minimal merit based incentives ($25, $50, or $75 gift cards ohhhhh!!!) all the while the department has been on mandatory overtime for the past year which just ended a few weeks ago. Expectations are numbers based which is terribly skewed and tracked. Incompetence runs rampant through the department with a mentality of doing only what needs to be done to get by. Rarely do people take initiative. Typical days are spent staring at the computer screen at endless spreadsheets of data that is questionable at best. Management is supportive. I could say more but it's all negative. I've been told dreams of ""Cigna"" the mother company and how great it is but that has definitely NOT trickled down to Cigna-Healthspring. I would recommend working for Cigna, steer clear of Cigna-Healthspring...at least their business operations department."
bad,"Answering phones, checked in & out patients,referred patients to outside specailist"
bad,"able to work from home"
bad,Horrible… Just don't waste your time applying for this position at this company. In training they let you believe you are really going to help the customer and that the company is about the customer. Its not. The only thing they care about are your numbers. Its sad because if management actually cared more about their employee's and the customers more people would stay in this position.
bad,CIGNA was a great training ground to learn operations management.  Tools used to manage are very helpful and create visibility into operations.
bad,"Constantly hiring unexperiences people at higher pay. Management was usually unprofessional and played favorites. I was promised another position in the company, but they kept making excuses and hiring outside unexperienced help over letting me transfer despite my good reviews and track record. Health benefits were god awful and too much for what they were giving us. Always asked to go the extra mile with very little incentive."
bad,"I was a contract employee for 1 year. Job security is 0, the managers and supervisors were not professional at all. Pay rate was poor. Lots of haters!"
bad,"Worst job ever, benefits, pay, and job advancement was good, being on the phone was not for me, working from home is a perk! Management was very poor .  Too far to drive, it seemed as if most people hated working there but stayed because of the pay,"
bad,"Many, many hours spent at the office working in multiple capacities with the understanding that there were advancement opportunities but most of those positions are filled by outside candidates or by close relationships within the company.  Many responsibilities with poor direction and supervision to learn protocols and proper fulfillment. Very stressful and demanding.  Procedure and protocol changes without notification and/or explanation."
bad,"limited opportunity to grow and move into a better position, unless all you want to do is work there and you don't have kids or family to take care of."
bad,"Typical workday is simple and repititous (for me). It is difficult to gain the respect that allows advancement, unless your a friend of those with power."
bad,"Cigna-HealthSpring's executive management team is lacking in direction and does not treat their employees fairly.  The culture is terrible."
bad,"I loved all the positions that I handled during the time I did work there but the Company Micromanagement culture is what I really didn't agree with. Cigna doesn't care about the quality of the work, only about productivity and doesn't care how the employees get there"
bad,"Though the pay is phenomenal, job satisfaction is below par. In the time I was there people were constantly leaving. The pressure to perform was high however there was no sense of accomplishment as goals were unattainable for everyone. It was frequently said from trainers and management, ""You will never master your role"". Guidelines and policy changed on a weekly basis. The company in its break neck speed to outpace its competitors were constantly coming up with new rules so there was continuous stress."
bad,"Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop."
bad,Cigna is trying to implement needed changes to compete and serve its customers well in this complicated and now-damaged healthcare environment.  Good and skilled people are employed and under contract trying to make these changes.  Management must make necessary changes in its too project-management centric approach to requirements development (e.g. get out of the way) which is impeding Cigna's attempts to change.  But changes are underway in early 2015 so that is a good sign...
bad,A typical work day was filled with ups and downs. They trained me for three days and then acted as if that was enough when I needed to know so much more. The managers were not very polite at all if I had a question. My co-workers over all was very nice and welcomed me all the time. The hardest part of the job for me was understanding the difference in the claims. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the hours for me.
bad,I enjoyed some of the people I worked for. I took calls from providers wanting to gather information about insurance and answered claims questions. I had to type everything that I said and what the caller said. It was quite tedious work. I learned a lot about insurance claims and was able to help them get paid for. That was the most rewarding part of the job.
bad,"Demanding work load, unattainable goals. Difficult to balance both home and work life. Work hours well exceeded 10 hours a day on average."
bad,"Working for Cigna, they do not value their employees. They have degraded their benefits year over year and do not supply adequate coverage. The company before Cigna took over, was a better company to work for. Now the expectations and meeting goals set by Cigna are much more challenging."
bad,Job is stressful with ever increasing goals.  training is unreliable at best.
bad,Not a great place to work. Care about employees or clients less than profit. 
bad,Company did not inact with the employee. The hardest part was to get work that kept you busy.
bad,You start off with a strong salary but then you will not see any real raise for years. The management is not very professional. The company has a high turn over rate.
bad,Management made sure that every employee had a good understanding of the product line that we were to be helping the customers with.
bad,Salary was fine.
bad,"Working at Cigna is much like working for a smaller start up organization, without the speed and agility. What makes it very challenging are the dozens of hats you will wear and the constant reorganization."
bad,Lots of meetings that take up most of your day and you don't have time to focus on your tasks.  You end up rushing to get things done or having to create a work around until you can get the time to actually pay attention to your daily work.  It is a pretty bad cycle.
bad,"As with any company, my experience at CIGNA can not speak for the general employee population.  I had the misfortune to have a manager who was not management material, to be diplomatic. .  Leaderships unwillingness to interfere came at a cost of 60% department flight. However, I have to share that CIGNA's compensation, benefits, and health and wellness plans are top-notch.  They allow community and volunteer time.  And there are always departments in every company who have desired, favored spots, and CIGNA had enviable teams that lived the company web-page."
bad,"I was with CIGNA for a short time, but the organization has likely changed since my employment. It is a great organization for entry-level professionals to get their feet wet."
bad,"Mandatory Overtime, constant stress, expected to work through lunch and breaks. Expected to work 6-7 day work weeks.  It's too bad that this company does not take care of it's employees"
bad,"You are most likely there as a help meet until claims are caught up and vacations time is over. If there is not a strong need for help you will be let go. If you are the most excellent clerical tasker and high speed typist you may be able to survive. Highly multi-tasking with zero down time. Hard to take time off, very demanding."
bad,"A typical day at work was receiving inbound calls to assist customers with their insurance policies, claims, appeals, and choice fund accounts; I really enjoy helping people who really needed the help. "
bad,"great peers, made life long friends"
bad,Working at the Cigna can be a very positive experience. Working as a team helps as far as work load and creating a very flexible schedule. The biggest downside to the job is that there is little to no opportunity for advancing either in position or salary.
bad,Much disorganization and lacking leadership.  Many employees with very little work to do.  This could be due to HealthSpring integrating with Cigna.  I don't recommend working there.  There are very few processes.  They don't fully utilize Project Managers.
bad,"Very busy company during the holidays, there were a lot of changes on updates on technology ,the management was so so  some demanding and some understanding."
bad,Behavioral Health client referrals received from local area contractors for counseling/crisis management.
bad,"I loved my co-workers, extremely good and hardworking people. The salary was fair, but the Insurance was a challenge. I really enjoyed speaking with the Providers with my job. Management wasn't always on the same page with one another, but always found a way to get the job done."
bad,Many of the managers cared more for the bottom line then the satisfaction of employees and customers alike.
bad,i like to work in good workplace and friendly people but get tried of work lot of overtime and stress..
bad,I worked close with my supervisor and I learned tying and 10key. my co-worker were all ages and It was a learning environment for me .
bad,"Good Culture, diverse, forward thinking and fair management. Layoff last couple of years in different departments. Life, AD&D and Disability group insurance block is sold to NY Life."
bad,"Al principio el ambiente de trabajo es bueno y sigue siéndolo entre compañeros del mismo rango, pero los mandos medios viven en una burbuja donde su realidad les parece aplicable a la de los rasos. La manera en que se valoran los idiomas que hables es completamente tacaña y el sueldo por el volumen de trabajo no compensa. Al final consiguen que prefiramos trabajar de la manera más mediocre posible de acuerdo con el salario cobrado"
bad,"CIGNA could still be in Greenville, SC if managed better not just for themselves. And could manage people not numbers frequently. Training never consistent such a downfall."
bad,"I tried for so long getting an interview at Cigna little did I know that working at Cigna would lead to depression and a life full of anxiety. Working in a call center is either FOR you or not. You get people who are rude, condescending and who want to hear what they want to hear. You never know what kind of phone call you’ll get. Working for Cigna Global you got people calling from India and Brazil where healthcare works differently and the training is just not enough. The stats you need to get on a daily basis is just insane and you are completely micro managed. If this sounds like the place you’d want to work then good news they’re ALWAYS hiring because people are ALWAYS quitting."
bad,Cigna offers so good benefits and lots of paid time off. They do internal career advancement often and offer education reimbursement. On the job training was a big deal. And they do lots of team building.
bad,This company is a company where you have to build relationships with people in position in order to move up in the company. So if you don't mind drinking and parting with your boss cigna is the place for you
bad,"nice and professional place to work,   great opportunity for growth and   management have open door policy always looking for ways to improve and satisfy their workers"
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job is that we are the best part of the majoirity of peoples day that walk through our doors.
bad,reviewing request for approval of medications that the doctor feel is best for the patient do to approved medications not working or causing bad effects for the patient
bad,"great cafeteria. "
bad,"Work the Specialty Pharmacy order from all workstations & know all the various department procedures. Walk orders through the system as needed for STAT delivery."
bad,"Enjoyed the patients and benefits, but no room to grow. There was lots of turn over."
bad,"low pay, unrealistic production expectations, management isn't real helpful"
bad,"it is a great place to work if you do not plan on advancing"
bad,"They lure you in saying that it is a work from home position. Let me guarantee you that it is not. We just had a snow storm and instead of working from home, I was schlepping it around for hours instead of ""working from home"" being productive. Management seems to have inferiority complexes with which they need to seek professional help. The market manager lives 2 states away and is not readily available. "
bad,This place is not run professionally. Difficult work enviornment. High turn over because job is so stressfull.
bad,"Although you learn much about the insurance industry and the training is excellent, the job is very stressful and demanding. Normal call volume is 80-100 calls daily. There is very little time to complete all issues. Company also has a high turnover rate and limited room for growth since they always need phone coverage the most not willing to promote"
bad,I really enjoyed my the job I was doing. My co-workers worked well together. CIGNA acquired the company I had worked at for 14 years and starting getting rid of the people who had either been around for many years or made more money than they felt employees should have made. Unfortunately I feel that the company made decisions that really hurt their business because they let go of a lot of talented people before taking the time to find out just how valuable they could have been for the company.
bad,"Provided through SAS, SQL and other analytic means reports and files for various clients within the company. Information obtained was used to test effectiveness of various managed care initiatives."
bad,The job was a lot to learn at such a fast pace. I would not refer this job to anyone. I absolutely woke up every morning with a migraine. No one seemed to care about making sure new hires are properly trained.
bad,"State of Delaware benefits are not comparable to other employers in the state, especially when wages are factored. Politics play a major part in advancement and most people are left at the lower lever."
bad,"I believe that I was just hired by this company as a temporarily hire without notice. I only worked 6 months with this company and in a blink of an eye we were terminated. There were too many managers that showed lack of interest in the Medical Assistant field. As a member of this company I felt like we lacked a lot patient care, I kept receiving negative feed back from our patients. The suggestions given to supervisor and managers took to effect. I believe that due to the poor management the company laid-off close to 30% of the employees."
bad,I've learned a lot at CIGNA working in many department when they need help.  The hardest part of the job was when the department had a layoff.  Enjoyed working with some many people.
bad,"It was good company to work for, but it was stressful as well."
bad,Production and Quality standards are high. Stress is very high. Supervisors and management are not consistent. Needs more communication within the departments.
bad,The typical day at work involves customer service as it is a call center environment. The overall environment is laid back and you can definitely be yourself. Poor management turned what was a good opportunity into a mostly toxic work environment.
bad,Cigna is an inbound call center role. It can be very stressful and there are tons of calls in que. I feel like there is favoritism within the company and I learned that first hand. This job is not for everybody.
bad,"Enjoyed processing insurance claims. However, if one didn’t meet the quantity and quality, you were out! Manager was nice. Now the company is not even in our location."
bad,not a great work life balance  for employees.  some management support most not. great flexible schedule for the billing department.  company sold to blue cross blue shield
bad,I worked 8am to 4:30 pm. I took anywhere from 50 to 100 calls a day. I learned how to help clients resolved there issues. Some managers were very helpful and some were not. My co workers at cigna was great. The hardest part of the job was calming down a very angry caller. The most enjoyable part of the day is when i know i have helped a client resolve any issue they called with.
bad,"Great place to work at- Friendly and very fast paced- Management always acknowledged every employee."
bad,"I like CHS as a  whole ,  its an awesome company  but the manger and supervisor  in customer  service is not  nice  at  all.  I will  not  advised nobody to go  in the  Customer Service  Dept."
good,"Management would change rules all the time, and they were never in the same page. Management had their favorites and they would not work with time off in case of emergencies or anything else. I would request days off 2-3 months in advance and they still wouldn’t approve them. They’re excuse was always there’s no time off available for those days."
good,"took over a 100 calls per day regarding benefits, eligibility, claim status, helped customer find in network providers, educated customer on healthy living"
good,"A typical day at work consist of lots of noise, arguments, and unresolved issues.  I learned how to get my work done regardless of the environment and work independently at times. I also learned how to claim customers and empathize with them. My co workers were fun people and we all worked together at times. The hardest part of my job was needing management help and not being able to get it at times. The most enjoyable part of my job was the contest the job would have and give out rewards."
good,"I worked for Cigna for two years, and at first really enjoyed my job.  I eventually became pregnant with my first child.  Cigna was not accommodating at all to me and my pregnancy.  This is not the place to work if you are looking for a family oriented place of employment. Managers lack the skills needed to even secure that job position."
good,Must be able to multi-task.
good,"I personally felt like I was just a number/ drone working for this company, I had high stats and praise but it was all words no compensation, 13 yrs vested."
good,"My direct supervisor was not as skilled as she should have been. but the people we served were wonderful, and caring individuals"
good,"My division was a phone based environment. The managers were disinterested in what took place on the phones as long as the job got done. It was a hot house environment with agents coming and going. "
good,"A typical work day included taking inbound calls and adhereing to a variable schedule.  I learned about insurance items such as claims, benefits, eligibility, precertification, complex benefits, etc.  I loved all of my co-workers and we all got along well since we were on such a small, dedicated team.  The hardest part of the job was not having a work/life balance for example, my three year old son was rushed to the emergency room and I had asked to leave work, which was 20 minutes from my end time, and I was penalized for leaving early when I had paid time off available for use.  The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to assist customers daily and truly make a difference in their lives, either by referencing a personal situation that compared to theirs or just simply by giving them the information they needed from a smiling face.  A smile goes a long way even when it's just a phone call."
good,they would make you work 50 hr a week or write you up. If the place burned to the ground and they had to pay us until they fixed the building we would only get 40 so how can they do that?
good,"Pretty reliable company,Have not had any problems.I worked at cigna in the mailroom and enjoyed it.Was also taught how to microfilm, also their  benefits were great."
good,"The company can use better communication on the leadership side. Very hard to manage a team of 23 Reps when policy and procedures are not shared with the rest of the leadership team. Poor equipment and systems. "
good,"Good learning experience. "
good,Answered anywhere from 100 to 150 calls a day. I learned how to do medical authorizations. My co-workers were great to work with. Management was not that great all.
good,"Been temping for a year with false hopes of becoming permanent. Over worked, under paid. Manager training is not a priority so your job is harder because the managaer doesnt want to take the time to learn the job. My coworkers are great! The hardest part of the job is stated above. The most enjoyable part is leaving at the end of the shift."
good,Poor Management.  they were not supportive when issues came up.
good,8 hour day. Sometimes OT is required. Alot of changes in the recent weeks. Co-Workers are ok.
good, Network with both the claimant and their physician to medically manage the claim from initial medical request reviewing and evaluating on going medical information; Manage assigned caseload of disability claims for Short Term disability; Evaluate eligibility of claimant; Understand and interpret contractual language and responsibilities; Manage both new claims daily as well as open claims equally
good,was peaceful..worked at home.
good,"Cigna is an large corporation and based on the location (state) "
good,"I was a call center worker for a little over 2 years.  "
good,I was able to leverage my time with the company and learn about the varieties of company plans available to employers and was able to help thousands of customers during my tenor.
good,Work can be super stressful because they want you to be every department at once. It’s unrealistic. No room for advancement unless you are friends with those who are in leadership. The Bonuses and raises each year are minimal.
good,"It’s a high stress job both mentally and physically. Very high call volume and customer complaints. Very structured and strict expectations and at times little resources to assist and inadequate support from leadership at times. "
good,Responsible for outreach to providers to confirm demographics. Email team once I obtained the needed information.  Helped gather information to provide to manager.
good,"some managers need work, others not so bad. company as a whole say they care about their workers but really only care about numbers. paid time off was good. flexible working hours."
good,I cannot describe how horrible of a company this is.  The management treated you like a piece of meat and you were expected to work sometimes from 7: AM to midnight.  It just wasn't good.
good,"it's a ok place to work. it's not what you think it may be. as most jobs are, the manager or supervisor does not know how to do the job their supervising. They are intimidated by employees that no more than them."
good,"stressful but consistent schedule changes made life difficult. management unengaged and lacked professionalism. Facility was fantastic, loved the onsite gym."
good,"This is a very fast paced place to work. You must be able to multi task and you need to be able to learn very fast,on the first time you're given the information. If you are the perfect employee you will receive a raise and bonus every couple of years. At Cigna Medical you either last here for years or you are gone within 8 weeks."
good,"There is a lot of growth opportunity but they are not quick to promote from within. They offer work from home opportunities, which are great for working moms"
good,Not a good company at this point.  Very unstable and just puts out fires but does not look at the impact that permanent pharmacists are making for the worse.
good,Last day 2/2001. I'm positive that the work environment has changed since then. I  worked in a call center and did intake. Created new cases for precertification and routed to the RN for approval. Tied to the phone and spoke to many people around the US.
good,"this job is not for people that don't handle stress well. management is very biased and there are favorites with every team. I would never work here again and I would rather pay for benefits then the joke of a medical plan they provide. The one positive I would have to say is the 401k. though this is hardly enough to make up for the unfair treatment of employees, horrible way customers are allowed to speak to you. It is definitely a yes or no job there is no middle ground."
good,A great deal of organizational flux due to pending merger and changing market strategies. Difficult environment in which to create and implement strategic planning due too changing market.
good,"CIGNA Healthcare (Charlotte) was a great place to work at one time. The comraderie there was pretty good and the employees who had been there for quite sme time felt more like family than co-workers. However, when the Charlotte office closed down, none of the employees were surprised."
good,"Health Insurance and vacation included for FT employees"
good,No job security. Schedules and hours change often. Company has been bought out 2 times in 5 years.Managemtn does nothign abotu lazy co-workers.
good,"Don't care about there patients"
good,"Outbound was an extremely high pressured job, but I learned many skills that I will carry with me in any job I may get. I learned customer service skills, IT skills, the key to confidence and how to be a part of  team. The hardest part of the job was keeping sales compliant in a bad sales week. My co-workers were like a small family, always keeping each other motivated and enthusiastic throughout shifts, we all kept the job fun and interesting for each other and had a lot of laughs, whilst staying professional. The most enjoyable part of being part of Cigna was the people I met and the friends I made, Outbound is like a family. My team leader/manager was always supportive of me and put a lot of his time and effort into creating an amazing team people and giving us all the help and support we needed."
good,"To learn about the insurance, to have further experience in funding, to learn about quotes, experience in how different facilities receive different funding"
good,"I assist customers on a daily basis with their health insurance needs, registration, navigation and understanding of our varied websites. I also educate my customers to understand the constantly-changing world of healthcare and healthcare reform. I enjoy working with people and have the honors of working with so many different people daily which gives me many opportunities for me to assist with helping them understand a very complex and sometimes intimidating, confusing world of health insurance."
good,This company was acquired twice within two years. There was a high turnover rate. There were never any set trainings or training manuals.There was blatant favoritism among management.  There were frequent mice that ran throughout the office during the day. There was limited room for advancement and only selected people were allowed to advance if they were friend with the managers. 
good,"Analize request, trouble shoot/problem solve, collect information, assign requests to be completed. Friendly people to work with, always willing to assist in any way possible."
good,They don't care about their employees. After 16 years on the job was told my services were no longer needed.
good,"Cigna is a decent place to work. Typical corporate environment, no overwhelming positives or negatives. I have worked in various IT departments within Cigna, and their Cybersecurity team has been my favorite. Some days it's a thankless job filled with menial tasks, but there's enough quality work that you feel like you are making a difference in keeping the company secure. I went from fixing broken computers and aiding users when they had ""human interface errors"" to helping increase security posture and bolstering network defenses. all in all, 3/5 stars. If you're looking for something that isn't ""cube life"", or looking to break away from the headache that is Agile, look elsewhere."
good,"Cigna's culture took a change for the better. However,  they don't honor degrees unless you are a high tier employee, otherwise you will be underpaid and overworked like the rest. Also they have some pretty strange tacktics for reducing the workforce so watch out. But. I can say that working for Cigna gave me initiative to got get what I wanted and to not sell myself short."
good,micromanagement was not always that way unrealistic sales goals based product.  Will not allow advancement to another area will keep you in the same position
good,Company is moving workload overseas. You are in one department for 2 and half going on three years. They will slowly move you to the phones. The phones are very stressful especially on Mondays. The calls come in back to back with no time to breathe.
good,"People were not overly friendly and  management were not often interacting with the employees when we needed to work on work issues. "
good,As far as insurance companies go Cigna is a decent place to work. Like all private companies Cigna is committed to the share holders and not their employees.
good,They promise career growth - yet make it difficult for anyone to move up. Poor benefits considering its the insurance company. You'd think they'd provide more for their employees. No recognition for hard work.
good,"A lot of IT work, a lot of customer service, and a lot of meetings.  No client facing required, everything virtual.  Great people to work with.  Flexible work hours within the department."
good,"extremely stressful and management unable to communicate effectively, need more effective tools to help employees too many changes that employees never hear about until it is too late"
good,"PPACA passed, thanks to generous contributions and lobbyist activity funded by CIGNA. Then the provisions of the law mandating corporate efficiency gave them cover for sacking their ""overhead"". 90% of our department disappeared in less than two years."
good,I was there for 5 years in the processing the claims and the mailroom they had there busy days and there slow days. they lost clients due to low offers
good,"Poor management; in fact, supervisor got demoted. Perhaps this was because I was contractual. Nevertheless, management was horrible as she did not know what she was doing."
good,The only thing I didn't like about working with Cigna is that the don't give you enough time to learn the information and the show favoritism out there.
good,Cigna has great advancement opportunities in other departments besides claims. Management does not go through leadership training which could be cause of major issues at this company.
good,"Very low morale, lack of advancement opportunities at Cigna...I do not feel valued and time reporting and micromanagement of breaks and explaining projects takes precedent over customer service."
good,"fast paced environment"
good,"Cigna had a lot of work and not very organized, Management was not helpful in assuring that their employees were armed with the most up-to-date information to make a great claim decision."
good,There is always work available in the department.  Plenty of good people who work for the company.  Management likes to keep track of every single moment of the day and what you are working on.
good,"great trainers, just very bad schedules breaks and lunvhes are tpo far apart. either too early or way too late during the day. the only good thing is that they only work monday thru friday."
good,"If you want entry level with no advancement that matters on a resume, Cigna is your place... The culture is based upon your skill to never leave your screens and ensure that when cursed off, you swallow pride and smile."
good,"When I got to work everyday; there would be work there to hold me over until noon, and after that, there was nothing else to do. My Team Lead never checked on me to see if I needed work, I would have to ask her. There is poor management and  lack of people skills there."
good,"cigna is a good company, they have alot of opportunities here and alot of building space as far as skills. the coworkers i work with are really good to get along with"
good,"The Best Part- compensation and benefits, enjoyed the actually work helping people was great! The hardest part of the job was the Job culture and the work life balance."
good,Good pay and and 401k match for a Insurance Company they have not so great insurance the Hr Dept will fire you and discriminate you if you try to do everything legally instead of handling situations on your own in a Divorce case that requires death threats
good,Overall not a terrible place some major changes need to take place. Work/life balance is hard while working here because of the amount of work at times
good,"A typical work day at Cigna will be assisting members with their policies as far as billing questions and also changing their healthcare plan. What I have learned with working with Cigna is knowledge of the healthcare system with the tremendous amount of changes that has taken place over the last couple of years. As far as the management aspect of the job there is a huge gap between the lack of respect and communication with the representative. If I had the option to become apart of the management team I would listen to my representatives feedback because they are closer to the job and members than I would be on a day to day basis. My co-workers are awesome we all are team players and will go the extra mile for the members. The hardest part working for Cigna is getting information in a untimely matter when it is in regards to new changes that will impact members and their policies. The most enjoyable part of working with Cigna is hearing the members say ""thank you so much for helping me you have really made this process easy""."
good,Working at this company was not easy. Collecting debt from people is not an ideal job. I did not like calling people just to be yelled at. You would have to be very thick skinned to do this job. It was a fun place to work with the employees and the management. They did keep the morale up.
good,"I have never experienced anything in my life as I have with this company. Management needs an overhaul big time!,  manager is a bully big time & h r has basically allowed the witch to stay in her job. Manager over coding dept in Alabama needs a lesson on how to be nice to her coworkers ..Alabama staff has a bad rep because of her.  HR. Get a clue"
good,"Call center stress and Production environment "
good,being on the phone all day with various people handling various situations
good,Handled UM insurance cases. great attention of detail needed and collaborated with medical professionals such as doctors and nurses to complete precert insurance claims.
good,"Fun, but I needed to get out of the house. tech support was terrible. Pay was not very good. and anytime the computer froze because too much was going on with the systems you are not paid for that, but you still have to wait and fix it yourself."
good,"The environment was workable, the associates are very cooperative."
good,This company seemed to have a big turn over. Seemed like people were always getting fired. This company made it very difficult for a woman to be a mother and have a career
good,"The worst place for advancement and compensation. There are some benefits (gym at work and WFH), but that masks the fact they refuse to pay market value and refuse to advance the best of the best. It is a popularity contest. Was one of the popular ones, so I understand, but then as the winds blow and you get new manager after manager, you have to start all over again and you do not know what to expect. Most managers do not know how to manage a team. They also tout diversity and it is a sham."
good,I did learn a lot about home delivery pharmacy. I wish that there were better trained supervisors in the Deptarment. The treatment of associates at Cigna Home Delievery is very poor therefore that is the reason for such a high turn over rate. There is no job security with Cigna home Delivery and there is no room for advancement.
good,Constant reorganizations.  Moving targets.  Lacking leadership.  Quick to change course with little to no warning.  Employees are not valued.  No future roadmap.
good,I really don't have much to say. It's a job just like any other job list depends on what it is your looking for. Good luck of you choose cigna. Management sucks
good,"When I first started working in my position, I had a great work/life balance (which is what the co preached) but over time when upper management changed, I lost a lot of flexibly. My manager no longer was able to mange our team, it was upper management making all the decisions. It was an unfortunate change of events. Wouldn't recommend the position for working mothers."
good,"If you are hourly, every second of your day is tracked, and scrutinized. High expectations, and pressure motivate team results. "
good,Nearly impossible to grow. They only promote the ones on the development programs. There are too many people looking to leave. The pay and the benefits are OK
good,"Would not recommend, unless you like to feel like your every move is being watched every second of the day, and they are on you constantly about every little thing. No matter how good you are at your job, if your “numbers” aren’t where management wants them, tough luck. Long hours, mandatory overtime, pre scheduled breaks and lunches—you don’t choose them yourself. Overall, a very stressful and anxiety invoking atmosphere."
good,"Come in  and sign in, dress code was very relaxed. i learned a lot in the short time i was there. management suck however most of the supervisors were amazing and easy to work with. i would say the hardest part of the job was working on many projects while still having to be on the phone. i enjoyed when 4:30 came so i can be out the door."
good,"It overall is a good place to work, there is a lot of gossip spread though. It feels as though there is no chain of command, and if there is it isn't very well done."
good,"You hv to forget family and everything"
good,"Feel like we are just a number.     Quantity over quality "
good,"upper management is very picky and micromanages to the ultimate.  Immediate managers have no control over disciplinary practices.  "
good,Place was okay to work but hours and culture were not always good. Cigna ramps up and ramps down with project managers and managers. Job security is always in question.
good,The people there are mostly nice A normal day you would check your emails prioritize you workload and start to work on census and loading plan designs The worst part was dealing with my last manager there
good,A very productive place to work with competitive benefits. Being able to set your own hours with having a flexible schedule. Processing claims on a daily basis and a team player atmosphere  was present.
good,"after doing a review last year it was discovered that I was at less than 80% of my job value. They made it nearly impossible to get a bonus now. They had me at 56 per year and per the review, my job was worth over 65 per year. "
good,"This was a very micro managed office and when I first started the claim managers had more room to make the decisions.  When I left it was more about numbers and metrics vs the customer/claimant.  "
good,"Typical day at work is filled with numerous meetings, multitudinous process to deal with, politics and lack of communication between teams and constant uphill battles."
good,"Cigna was ok, it has it's perks and room for improvement. It could be better.It was a fast paced position. The Case Management team was good. I don't have a lot to tell about Cigna, I was a temp there and that was it."
good,"Cigna is too far out for me to drive anymore. There is no job security."
good,"Paid less than what the going rate was for position, constantly getting calls for other claim managers. Health benefits could have been better for insurance company"
good,Senior and upper management of Cigna really have the mission of Cigna at the forefront but local mgmt doesn't.  Local mgmt is more concerned with numbers and getting work done fast instead of having it done correctly for the patient.  Consistency is not lacking and everyone works orders however they want.  Not much follow through.
good,"If you are assigned to a client and your client does not renew their policy, you could find yourself jobless. Keep in mind that your client's renewal is contingent upon little to no increase in premium. Its difficult to transfer to other departments within Cigna"
good,"Relaxed, casual atmosphere. Friendly co-workers. Work-flow slow. Very slow in being able to advance and get permanent employment. Very little communication from management."
good,"As an employee with a Masters Degree I don't see a professional leader for me to climb. They hire management from outside the company. However, this is a great stepping stone."
good,Answering incoming calls from upset members and providers because claims are not getting paid or prescriptions are not being filled. Members are always upset because there are no in network providers anywhere.
good,Stressful company to work for as always additional tasks being added but no time to do them in. There is not a good atmosphere. Job security is a worry as Madrid seems to be where the jobs are going. Good hours as Mon-Fri 9-5.
good,"Excellent if you can manage not to offend someone higher on the management chain than you. Any offense to some of the team leads will get you fired for absurd things, management is not above lying, forging documentation. The office politics there are very poor, stressful place to work."
good,"I was in a catch 22. Because I worked for a difficult client, everytime I applied for another job I was overlooked because they always had a  hard time finding anyone to work at this specific location. It depends on what area of Cigna you work in how satisfied you will be with your position. Some mgrs. are fantastic and others, it's a mystery how they got their position? The benefits and compensation are the best ever. Because I took my job seriously I came in early and left late. Work life balance was terrible."
good,"Good place to work... Incentives are good, always looking out for hte best of the customer.. Working inviroment is good as well! Day to day work is through email.."
good,"Training provided for the position with well qualified instructors."
good,"The Cigna atmosphere is great. Decent hours 8-5p 9-6p. Pay for a temp is pretty low anywhere from 12.50-15.00. Permanent employees 17.00-21.00. The work load is average and call center is hectic, but varies during enrollment season. The thing that got me, is that when a tech verifies the clinical's to process the appeal, the Pharmacist goes behind every tech and Denies the members their meds, after they have met the criteria!! I don't understand. I feel sorry for the members having to fight for their meds.."
good,"From the time you enter the building you are clocking in. There are multiple systems that you are logging into. Bathroom breaks are checked religiously. "
good,"Management plays favorites, unable to advance due to management.  Good benefits.  Coworkers nice. Busy place. manager did not listen to employees ideas."
good,"Depends who you work for. Some people are happy some are not. Management is very inconsistent, work/life balance is very hard within certain teams."
good,"I had set duties each day, as I was on a specific assignment to assist in fourth quarter open enrollment process.  I learned some processes in Sales Force.  My manager was a wonderful teacher, but really did not have enough time to teach, so I was left to my own devices most of the time.  As for my co-workers, I seldom saw or spoke with another soul in that huge office all day, day-after-day.  The most difficult part of the job was being so isolated, both physically and socially during the length of my assignment."
good,"answered all members questions thru email, rather it was member benefits  that was being verified"
good,This is a OK company to work for. I didn't really enjoy working in healthcare but many people do.  The pay is reasonable but not great.  Some days the job can get boring .
good,"I had my ups and down with this employer, they were very business minded and being a single mom at the time my work like balance just did not work."
good,"Low morale, very quick ever-changing pace which can keep it less than boring but the productivity standards do not coincide with the time required for accuracy."
good,Call center environment was crazy busy and you are expected to put work before your personal life. Not a lot of flexibility with schedules.
good,"A little difficult place to work in. Old technology and change adaptation is near impossible. Despite efficiently putting in 16 hour work days, for 2 consecutive years, I could make little a difference. Work culture does not promote productivity and you rather spend time fire fighting, instead of performing add value tasks. "
good,"It's a great Job that offers a lot of knowledge, Requires a lot of reading to find your answers, staff always there to assist"
good,Review incoming application for group medical insurance.
good,"This was my first health insurance job. I learned a lot and liked the concept behind working in teams. I found the management to be less than optimal. Being an company that works on the economy rather than government contracts, the upper management put a lot of pressure on the middle management, and often forgot about quality of life and happy employees making better employees. "
good,CIGNA is a great paying job and I am very greatful to have it. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I can help the customers with their health care needs.
good,"Working for Cigna is very intricate in computer information and insurance rules, they are very good to their employees and try to make everyday fun and exiting, but the down side is that ""burn out"" is very likely after 2 yrs in service."
good,A very diligent work environment. Quite structured. Co-workers are very dedicated.
good,"i was in charge of processing customer claims and after combing through each individuals policy, i would decide based on the policy what the doctor actually got paid for a procedure.  this job was very stressful as there was no room for error.  however this job gave me challenges in which i succeeded at."
good,At Cigna my job consisted of answering telephone calls from customers and addressing any issues they were having with their insurance. I enjoyed helping our customers.
good,Work is performed at your own pace. Management does not really interfere with employees. Once assignments are assigned everyone knows their work that has to be completed.
good,"Its ok. Been there a year. No promotion, if you want to be chained to your desk this is the place for you"
good,Manager's don't have the company's longevity at heart. CO-workers are mostly returned former employees & older.
good,Answering phone calls and assisting customers with delivering medication to there homes.
good,A typical day is busy and often requires frequent changes in what/how you do your job due to not having enough staff and covering for people who are out. You are rarely recognized for hard work by management but those who work beside you will recognize your and be appreciative.
good,"Sought after company to work for in the healthcare fields, especially in data analytics. Good benefits and focus on maintaining quality employees on a national level."
good,"The job in itself if fun, rewarding, and keeps you busy. But the management is just awful as they do not listen to employees and micromanage us to no extent imaginable. The workload and expectation do not reflect proper monetary compensation as compared to other companies for the same business role. Culture is nice as employees have each other's backs and are willing to work with one another to resolve issues and complete tasks. Good place to work if management can pull it together and learn how to manage and not be completely authoritative when it comes to micromanaging."
good,I was a medical receptionist for Cigna Medical Group for close to 13 years. Never had any problems until a new manager came in. She would make up things that had no factual evidence. Blame you for being resistant if you just had question and want more things done with less and less. I left because of bad management and the stress started affecting my blood pressure. Bring told not to verify insurances for copay information even when I knew a copay was due. Being told I sent a patient to a coworker to sign up for the patient portal when the coworker didn't even have access to it and then being told to right a manual so she would know how to do it. Getting an email about Medicare Advantage patients and asking a question regarding the email and when the patients are able to have physicals down is being resistant. The job its self is not bad but you have people consistantly talking negatively about you and learning how to deal with it is a must. I tried to transfer over and over again for the same position at other locations and constantly was denied.
good,"Cigna is a leading organization in healthcare services for medicare patients. Many of the staff work remotely from home, however the office is usually deserted with a small amount of workers. Its quiet enough to get work done but keeps the moral down. The management tends to micromanage from offer and that can be challenging. While my job function was not to difficult working with management was difficult and I felt under appreciated. My co workers and working with the members was the most enjoyable part of this position"
good,"Cigna HealthSpring, Cigna's division providing Medicare Advantage, Medicare Drug Benefit and retiree health services has suffered from ineffectively leadership and management resulting in ever-changing strategies and priorities.  While these issues are known and are being addressed, the correction is uncertain and far from complete.  The division suffers a culture of poor and indirect communication and a lack of skill in the translation of strategy to tactical plans.  The parent corp is a more mature organization with exceptionally high integrity and ""walks the talk"" of stated values and missions to a much greater extent than most organizations that I have seen."
good,"While you work under a temporary agency; you are constantly promised that X,Y,Z will happen, which it doesn't. The sales floor is extremely loud with people clapping and cheering for only people they like. If you don't gossip at the ""water cooler,"" then you won't be someone they like. When you make a sale, they give out $1.00 - $3.00 ""prizes or bonuses.""  There is no commission. While you are meeting and exceeding their goals that are hard to achieve; the recognition is hardly seen. When you walk on the sales floor there are a lot of arts and crafts. I honestly felt it was suiting as I was working with a bunch of Pre-K people anyway. And you have to watch out for the target that always seems to be on your back no matter how good you are."
good,"Cigna's stated philosophy on compensation is that their goal is to not pay more than the median market value for any given job which might be acceptable if there were opportunities to advance so that one's compensation grows at the rate of inflation advancement is based purely on who you know and how much they like you, not on what you know or what results you deliver. Additionally, the organization openly states that their employees will never be offered health insurance benefits that are on par with Cigna's customers which seems to convey the feeling that Cigna looks at it's employees as a  somewhat captive cash cow and none of that feels very good."
good,Good people to work with but low salary and not much help from management for advancement.  They are a company that is unsure of which direction to go and always changing course.
good,"Perhaps a great example of capitalism on steroids. "
good,"Cigna is a stable company as long as you are performing well and doing what is expected of you. However, the pay is not commiserate with the industry and the positions that they have there. The company is the fifth largest health insurance carrier in the United States, yet the pay does not reflect that. If I wanted to process medical claims again I could do it with a higher pay scale. I could also advance to management and possibly go to another team from what I have learned from others I know at these other companies. With Cigna you are working in several different roles at the same time, and of course, only paid for one. You have managers who are in a different state from you. Therefore, they have no real rapport with you. My last manager had no claim experience and was horrible at managing us, and was not in the state with us. The manager prior to that one, only saw us once, because that manager was two time zones away. If something big happened with the computer system we could not contact that manager right away. "
good,It's a great place to work however management is very unprofessional. They treat the call center area very seriously. However if your hired full time the pay is great.
good,The expectation to complete tasks is sometimes unrealistic.
good,Assist the pharmacist from the pharmacy with insurance verification and to check if the customer had doctors prior authorization.  Also assist customers with Insurance and medication verification.
good,You need to be ready to do what you need to do to be recognized. the middle management does not have an open mind and you need to fight to get your idea across. what they practice is not what they preach. I realized after I left how unfairly I was treated here. They frown upon you growing within the company without approval.
good,"Nice office building, but contractors work in the basement. New fancy cafeteria but expensive to buy lunch. Many contracted employees with same responsibility as real employees but lack the employee status and benefits"
good,"Cigna is Cigna, always has been Cigna, always will be Cigna. Lack of career advancement and learning opportunities is the biggest problem, but if you don't mind that, it's fine...  It's Cigna."
good,"nope dont want to discuss.. suing them... not a place to grow, management wants numbers, job requirements keep escalation but salary and position static"
good,"8 hours a day back to back calls from angry customers wondering why their medical procedures aren't covered and you have to explain why, very thoroughly and non medically, even though all the literature is written in medical jargon and very difficult to find and understand because their systems are very convoluted. Training classes were extremely difficult and I often wondered why we weren't getting paid a lot more for our efforts, not to mention the company voluntold us to switch to another department and rush to train in that department because they were way busier than expected, then we had to switch back to another department after the 3 month rush. Very stressful, not worth the peanuts. And the discount of the insurance that the INSURANCE COMPANY you work for provides was laughable, still very expensive and not that great (because we knew the caveats of our own plans because that's what we were answering questions on all day long.)"
good,working at a call center is stressful how ever cigna tracks your bathroom time if you are away from you desk in in the bathroom for more than 3 minutes than they clock you out and you get an email letting you know they are watching you it is very uncomfortable and not a places I would like to work at.
good,Typical day involved requesting and reviewing the mail for the evidence of disability.  could have provided better training on the objective evidence of disability.
good,"When I worked there, I met a lot of people that were nice and friendly, but also some that were not.  It is hard to move around within the company especially if your manager does not want to let you transfer.  It's a lot of work, but can be very rewarding for your resume."
good,"there is a culture of cut throat, Its a fast environment that you feel like your just a number. Human resources is not there for the employee. Management is poor, they employ managers that have no training and are unprofessional"
good,You couldn't talk to your peers while working. Management would question you if you were out of your seat or if you went to the bathroom. Overall exp was very stressful.
good,Customer Service Rep are required to take all incoming calls. No two calls are the same. You would have to be quick thinking on your feet and go above and beyond to please the customer
good,"Management had a high expectation of their employees, when I worked there. However, the salary compensation was not a match tot he workload that was expected. "
good,A typical day is never boring. There is always a challenge to be addressed head on. You learn a lot of new things by getting involved when asked or volunteering. Working with the right people makes the job fun and enjoyable. Working with other less engaged than you makes it interesting and at times frustrating. There isn't much support from management as they tend to stay out of it until it's time to take credit.
good,"This was an excellence entry level job. It will teach you a lot about front line technical support. The best thing about this job is they don't micro manage you, they allow you the freedom to complete your job with little oversight but they are there if you need support."
good,I will provide any answers to the  questions you have asked me on here in the interview. Honestly at this job I have learned a lot learning about the insurance world and knowing how things for people elder people who have insurance.
good,Mange excellent customer Service alongside a pharmacist explanation of medication and benefits as well as the over the counter medications
good,"I have learned a lot about ICD-9/10 coding and using Next Gen at this job. I see this company as my first job in the Medical Field. I look forward to working for a company where I see more growth in my future. It has been a great company to start my career with and  I love the people,and the work environment is amazing."
good,"no detail please, the supervisors have favorites and treat them differently than those they don't like.  women are favored over men and outnumber men about 9 to 1."
good,A Company where you can grow within. Love the co-worker there.The hardest part of the job is making sure you have to make production and quality.
good,Employees should be allowed to work from home more. Work environment not healthy because too many people share space. Free breakfast is offered sometimes. Some managers are hard to get to know because of personalities.
good,This is a good place to work if you are looking for a job. The co-worker are friendly. The hour of are good. The benefits are good.
good,It has been a great learning experience. Their are things that can use some improvement. The work/life ratio can use some revising.
good,"Cigna demands overtime on a weekly basis, there is no work life balance.  They have very high expectations of their front line staff."
good,Entered data into system all day. I learned more about different computer software and how to get around in them. Co workers were friendly when I seen them. We all had our own cubicles.
good,Everyday I would go in the office and sit at my desk and take calls. Clients would ask for information on their plan and I would tell them. They could also make changed to their accounts and so forth. I enjoyed just talking with these clients and helping them.
good,"Daily collection of provider information to update records for claims to pay."
good,"It's a self learning environment if you know how to look for things.  I did have the opportunity to learn about healthcare and how health plans work.  The hardest part about the job was the training; there really isn't any and there wasn't a lot of direction.  I enjoyed being in a relaxed environment, however, the learning curve was very chaotic and very limited."
good,"A typical day is clocking in and immediately start taking calls. They expect you to be glued to the seat. They have an adherence policy that most call centers have. But timing your bathroom breaks and emailing when you have to use the rest to explain why you clocked out is a little to far. "
good,"i worked from home which was great, to change hours with cigna they give all the new hires the best hours, there is no scenoritie . there is no credit for job well done. surveys are based on last person taking the call from the member, and if the last reps did nothing for the member and the member didnt like the insurance the survey is given to you even tho you may have resolved the issue."
good,The National division was going to be sold or moved so everyone was on soft insecure ground.
good,"Prepared correspondence and reviews and edited written material. Responsible for data collection and/or date entry into computer system related to the acquisition of health plan referrals and authorizations for Part B medical services. Sorts and distributes faxes. Prioritizes and triages workload and gathers and inputs information for clinical co-workers. Answers inquiries, gathers information, resolves routine matters, and responds to and as necessary follows up on minor complaints or problems. Communicates via phone and fax with health plan members and healthcare providers. Works in fast paced environment with strong focus on compliance, customer care, accuracy and production. Understands and meets deadlines. Utilizes on job training and provided resources to act as a subject matter expert, answering provider/member questions regarding policy and procedures needed to acquire authorization for services. Develops understanding of responsibilities of other departments for purpose of working with them to complete tasks."
good,"- I learned the most from working for this company."
good,"I answer medical questions, investigate claims and handle customers on a daily basis."
good,"Ok place to work, however, the benefits and career path are not great, skills and knowledge an individual have are not merit for advancement."
good,"Provided benefit structure of various Medicare Advantage Medicare Part C replacement plan, eligibility and prior authorization information on file.  I loved expanding knowledge of Medicare approved products and understanding how Independant Physician Association (IPA) and  third party administration (TPA). I obtainedThorough training on QNXT Trizetto, MHC and CCMS (for authorization on file) for claims inquiry and eligibility. Also gained knowledge in using EZCAP and iHealth programs to view IPA/TPA claims to view denial/adjustment codes that IPA would pay instead of CIGNA Healthspring. Used Emdeon client access for payment details  and Emdeon Vision Suite and Etracks to see pdf files on claims in a call center environment.  The most challenging part of job is navigating through various links and benefit grids, I discovered  WIKI (resource to locate information to do job effectively) minimizing need to go to management for questions directly but challenged increase call intake."
good,"After seeing the revolving door in the IM department I was increasingly more worried about the culture and environment.  Management puts on a good act but when decisions are made there is no discussion, warning, or pre-emptive attempts to work with employees.  After seeing it happen a handful of times, it finally happened to me as well.  I finished my project early and was let go from my contract.  I was told that my position was going to change to be more ""technical"" as in developer type background.  I put in long hours and OT to deliver on time and earlier than other project teams and was thanked by be being let go 6 months early.  I also found myself left out of a lot of office conversations as I could not speak Indian.  To the credit of management, they are trying to implement change, but it is easy to burn out in that environment."
good,"A lot of women work here making this a very petty and highschool-esque environment. the pay could be better and the people are only looking for ways to advance and will throw you under the bus to get there. All that aside, its a job, not a career"
good,-Production driven company and always working on deadlines
good,"This job was very enjoyable with the clientele and internal employees. Worked on employee eligibility with clients, third parties and internal employees.Had a great team in Denison to work with and help out eachother. Management was not well versed in their roles and did not budget well for any bonuses each year or advancement. They did not have their employees best interests in mind. I liked speaking and helping out our regular clientele. The hardest part of the job was the hours."
good,cigna does not have much work/life balance. I dont believe there is much job security with cigna.
good,"Good people to work with, interesting work, below average compensation, below average environment (re: old equipment, worn and dirty carpets, constantly breaking elevators). Good cafeteria. Good convenient location. Good policy re: customer service, training."
good,"Good company to work for. Many long term employees. It really depends on the project that you are working on. Has a very US focused delivery mentality which means that you deliver a project to a date rather than scope / quality. The project delivery date often changes for no specific reason, which means that you could have been working flat out for months to deliver to this date and then it no longer applies. Can be very frustrating. Senior management changes often, which also can derail a project."
good,"When hired they boast about a life/work balance and how flexible they are but when you get through training there is really no flexibility at all, you are on the phone with people and have managers remoting  into your computer to make sure you are doing your job, it is very big brotherish , and weird over all. This is the worst job I have ever had but it does pay the bills. If you can suffer through rude people calling in the pay isn’t that bad."
good,"Executive Leadership is great too bad it doesn’t trickle down to management. EL has a culture that is not followed through unfortunately because CIGNA itself is a fabulous company."
good,Nyaman dan kekeluargaan..selalu ada solidaritasnya dalam bekerja
good,"Cigna is an overall good company to work for with a lot of opportunities available. Although, working in the call center leadership position, you are responsible for a large team, heavy work load with little pay. The call center manager functions as a drill sergeant and is very unprofessional at times with sharing personal feelings and information about supervisors to other supervisors. The call center was managed well overall but if you are not planning on kissing the call center manager's rear end, it's not the place for you."
good,"Workplace is fun if you work in the office and not remote. Management micromanages, and office politics is stressful. Expectation is high, and if you do a good job, you still will not be rewarded"
good,"I believe in Cigna's mission and the value proposition sales was asked to go out and preach everyday. Unfortunately, management was very poor in my market, and I was never presented an opportunity to succeed."
good,"Working in disability claims, you often have to deliver news to customers that negatively affect their finances and sense of security which takes an emotional toll. Also, management/directors often go back and forth with different processes and priorities that don't seem to have a lot of thought about the long term results."
good,"The company was very good when I first started, but it went downhill after the first two years.The new management team were not the best in the world."
good,"Learned tons about insurance and was motivated to stay with a small promotion however I moved back to Tyler from Sherman and had to quit.  At the point I left, they had let several high ranking managers go because of their top pay."
good,"nice place, nice employees, reasonable place to work, convenient location, fair treatment, I enjoyed the training and the professionalism. I would go back, was a temporary employee while employed there."
good,ok company to work for. I did learn a lot while there. I feel like i can move forward in a better position where m career will grow where I want it to.
good,"Personally, I believe that Cigna is doing its employees a disservice by allowing so many individuals to work from home. I found that it was difficult to establish relationships with teammates who worked in different parts of the country out of their homes. I worked in an office without anyone from department which was compromised of 1,000 individuals if not more. I lacked support and had zero formal training. Learning on the go is much more difficult without onsite support. Over a 16 month period I met my boss in person a total of 3 times."
good,"I was a contractor, not an FTE. Significant organizational and network churn due to recent mergers and acquisitions.  Confronted challenges with network integration and security."
good,"I worked for a division of Cigna many years ago, so I don't know if my opinion of the company is still valid or if it applies to the overall organization."
good,"I spent over 20 years there. I raised 2 children, bought a home and several cars while employed. I never intended to leave but felt like I had been strung along by my manager who knew my salary was not adequate in comparison to the amount of skill and effort I put into my work. I would never have left if this issue had been rectified."
good,It was fun at times but the Work at home management was awful....The whole point of going from office to work at home was so I could watch my 4 month old and work as well...They made it impossible to do both. The schedule options were not to satisfactory and the manager was incredibly strict and didn't give me a chance.
good,For a starter job it's great and depends on which department you get hired. To make a career out of it that is a personal choice one would need to make once hired and again it depends on the department.
good,"Good organization with longevity of employees.  Pay is OK, some room for growth although once in certain jobs, it's hard to get out of that department"
good,"Depending on your role in the corporation a typical day at work would entail a plethora of phone calls, claim management, and composing letters. "
good,Great company but could definitely use a little spring cleaning and updates to make it a more positive work environment/company. Compensation is not very fair for current employees but new employees are brought on with a very nice salary.
good,"Reviewing client's contracts daily to ensure medical benefits were setup correctly with the claim payment system. Inter acting with service partners regarding clients needs. Time managing your daily report and e-mails regarding medical benefits. Conference calls, emailing, and on going projects is a typical work day."
good,"Fun place to work. Management not bad. There was some room for advancement in other locations in the building. Very professional place to work. Co-workers very helpful, and knowledgeable."
good,"Normal, trabajo sencillo y repetitivo, la gente q supervisa es tuanis, los managers no tanto o en absoluto. La soda es regular tirando a apenas aceptable."
good,"Basically got written up for bogus performance issues, And was supposed to have weekly check ins NEVER had 1 check in then was fired. For lack of better reasoning I was targeted for termination well before I had any so called performance issues."
good,Depends on the role.  Definitely does not match person to role.  You have to know which team to apply to and what's expected in that role.  They seem to be more interested in filling a role than making sure you fit the role.
good,no comment but its good for entry level positions in the insurance industry although the pay is not on par with competitors...........................
good,"Great Company if you can gain employment outside of the Houston Location.  Poor management that lacks professional skills to assist employees in career advancement.  Management operates based on a personal status, it's all about who likes you.  Not your abilities or qualifications."
good,good company but lot of micro-manager and lackadaisical managers and busy work... a lot of busy work. ok/decent benefits...basic pay. give good pto benefits. its an okay job use as stepping stone. do have advancement available if your a brown noser.
good,Great learning opportunities.  Good culture with other employees. Management was not the most communicative. Not the best place to work if you are a contract employee.  Your employment may be strung out for years if you hope to be made an FTE.
good,"* Busy, always on your toes"
good,I like working for Cigna helping people with there benefits and health needs is my background. I can do this behind the seens or in front. Cigna Health Spring is the side I work on and it seems to be a difference with system they use from Cigna. When applying for other positions you are consider not qualified on Cigna side for any positions. And they do not offer training to where you can advance to to different areas within the Company. I wish to grow with the company but its hard to transfer within.
good,I really enjoyed my job when I first started. It seems every few months they make up some ridiculous rules and policies that make it impossible to do our jobs. They are making it difficult to help customers.
good,"Cigna were a great Company to work for in terms of there being a generally good atmosphere with good management. You were always delighted with a sale in outbound and made to feel important.l and appreciated. The problem was always job security. I worked there, got laid off, taken back and then laid off again!  It was also a strain keeping to the targets when really burnt out as outbound is very very challenging in terms of being totally consumed in calling. It is literally constant from 1 til 9 with an hours lunch and some 5 minute breaks thrown in to catch your breath. Hard on the throat, lungs and brain. Always felt drained going home.  But, through it all they do make it as pleasant as possible working there and the environment is very professional and friendly. It is a good place to work if you have reserves of stamina and don't mind half expecting a short term ride. ."
good,"Too micro managed. You never know who or what is holding you back. You apply for jobs and never hear back or get interviewed, then months later you're informed the job has been filled. It's who knows who."
good,CIGNA was one of my first employers.   This is actually my second time working there.   I went back because they do provide great insurance coverage and I just had a son so I needed it.   The company is an equal opportunity employer.  The management there is very helpful and they do listen to everyone's needs.   Unfortunately they do fire people for the littlest reason.   I did enjoy working there but wish it was for more money than what was given.
good,Management at Cigna is the major issue with Cigna. They do not value their employees with no signs of advancement. My manager copied and pasted review responses in all of my team's responses with no real feedback.
good,"Typical day starts at 8am and ends at 5pm, from monday to friday. Management depends on personal but overall is good. Co-workers are great, friendly and team players. The hardest part of this job is time management. The most enjoyable part of the job is job security."
good,this was a great place to work when I started by in 1995. It started to change around 2011 with new management in radiology dept.
good,"Employed with Cigna for over 17 years.  Once I moved to IT, we worked 7 days a week for years.  If you don't mind working your tail off, great place to work."
good,"Big company with lots of room to move around and flexibility around schedule and work-from-home options but very unfriendly, contentious environment - 'push-back' culture - not collaborative - departments pitted against each other"
good,No comment.  Just disappointed with the reorganization. Don't want to comment any further about my job there.  It is confidential.
good,Very busy days. More work than you have workers. Very high turn over rate I am thinking because of the pay and amount of work you receive as a claim manager.
good,"A typical day at work involved assisting and counseling beneficiaries with medical and social issues relevant to their care."
good,"Moved around a lot within the company for business needs. Must be able to learn on the fly and accept new positions. Co-workers were nice, most supervisors were nice and listened. Expectations were not realistic in providing excellent customer service."
good,Productive workplace. Took inbound and otbound calls fom members and providers regarding denial or approval of medication. Filled prescripts
good,"Typical day for me after signing in to start processing you first fax for a prior authorization, a medication you can barely pronounce and discover there is no member ID# or date of birth and you have to reach out to the MDO's office to get infomation lacking on the fax to process request,etc. I learned a lot about medication and what members go through in order to obtain the medicine needed. As far as management they all bring something unique to the table and you can learn from them all if you have the right attitude and a teachable spirit. I enjoy my co-workers mainly because I am a people person and I really don't know strangers, I believe in reaching out to others. The hardes part of my job was getting through training, reading was not enough and digesting all the medical terminology and understanding some of the programs in the beginning, I'm more hands on. The most enjoyable part is I get to interact with people and I love to challenge myself and it was very challenging."
good,"A typical day at work goes by in a blink.  Very fast pace environment, keep up or stay behind.  My co-workers are amazing people.  The most enjoyable part of my job is that I am able to help and communicate with people,  work on important projects, and exercise my skills."
good,"It all depends on what department you work in that will determine how you feel about the company.  I like all the departments I worked for, some the people I worked with were friendly."
good,"Your schedule depends on you department."
good,"Very repetitive work. The management did not seem to care about improving the work flow. Cubicles, and very gray colors in the buildings make you depressed."
good,The department of PIMS which maintained provider data records was a stressfull enviorment. A typical day was to work a required number of applications per hour with quailty as well as efficiency. I believe I had a great group of co-workers who were easy to get along with and we all worked together to get the job done. The hardest part of the job was the uncertain changes with the type of work given. Meaning that most of the changes to the work process was not completely worked through before going live. The most enjoyable part of the job was the work itself and my co-workers.
good,it was an okay place to work for but a lot of office politics! don't have too many nice things to say about this company which change 3 times while I was there
good,"Answered calls from members about there health benefits, claim, referrals and authorization status. Educated members on there health plan and there options. Assisted members with locating doctors to address there healthcare needs. "
good,"Working there with on going training to a sure our customers are please and continue to stay.   Co-workers are great to work with. "
good,CIGNA is a good company with many opportunities for advancement...
good,"Quiet place to work, fun atmosphere,Needs more consistency."
good,Worked her for a long time and had a hard time getting use to the environment. When working with medical insurance you come in contact with some people with terminal illnesses. When I was unable to help these people with there ongoing issues it was upsetting to me .
good,All work no play your job is taken seriously. Its your typical every day customer service job
good,I enjoyed my job of contracting over 10 years in the same job function.  We where short staff for about 2 years and work load became unbearable and unhealthy. But we still have to step up on the plate. They expect you to work longer hours.
good,"Cigna is a good company for IT, specifically for entry level candidates."
good,I have learned a lot in the job I am in but I want to learn more in another field of study that I am in school for. My current job is a fast paced environment that leads a very productive day that keeps me busy and makes me a hard worker and gives me experience in the administrative/clerical area.
good,Most postions you can come in anytime from 6-9 and then work your eight hours for the day. Usually Overtime provided and some manatory. Go over and beyond!
good,"Working at Cigna was very diversified."
good,Responsible for a team of up to 15 Claim Managers to ensure they are administering contract the way it is written and providing the best service.  Most difficult part is having to do the work of my Supervisor is newly hired as well as my own responsibilities.  Although I thoroughly enjoy my team and working with them.
good,"Over seen local satellite office"
good,"Department in which I worked did not have room for advancement. Very hard to move around within company. Promotions not necessarily granted on your ability, but who you know. This is very discouraging. I learned a lot in my position, but after a year it became very tedious. Some managers are not supportive when asked to assist you unoffically in learning new areas of business. Hardest part of working there was making suggestions on how to improve business and being told there are system constraints on changes that should have been implemented years ago. Most enjoyable part of working there were the people who called in and my immediate coworkers."
good,It is a very active call center type of environment.
good,Cigna relies on the efficiency of their employees to create an effective business. Cigna takes accountability of all things that occur.
good,"The hardest part of the job was never being caught up. There were so many tasks to be completed, phone calls and e-mails to be returned, mail to be opened, charts to be filed out"
good,"Although they offer a competitive salary, employee treatment amounts to creating cannon fodder for waste. The type of place that will suck you dry and spit you out, at least the customer service division will."
good,Be very sure the field of clerical duty is what you're looking for before entering this field. Due to the small office space and limited scope of duties there is a lack of promotion opportunities here.
good,"Great exposure to opportunity, however lack of compensation and ability to advance cause a lot of top performers to seek employment outside of the organization."
good,"In the hospital for 5-6 hours doing chart reviews , visiting patients and gathering information for discharge . assisted with home care needs as appropriate. loved my co-workers and management staff . our clerical staff was great . hardest part of the job was getting in and out of the hospital to review charts prior to the doctors removing them . enjoyed getting patients to the right place with the right care."
good,All departments were in the same building so problem resolution was easier to accomplish.  Too many supervisors that were not management material even though they were knowledgeable.
good,"A Micromanager that makes your life miserable from the moment you arrive."
good,I serviced customers with their Short Term Disability claim while they were off of work for a Sickness or Injury. Spoke with Customers over the phones on a daily basis.
good,"Cigna has become a massive company with a ton of change and transition for roles/teams/departments, but they're trying hard to become a modern environment. In the Bloomfield, CT headquarters its clear that they're changing the working status quo to become more flexible and reduce the number of empty rows of cubes. I'm not sure that it will eventually pay off with higher retention of young professionals because it still feels dated and the area is not inspiring at all."
good,"Overall the pay and benefits are good, their requirements and quotas are not realistic, the turnout rate is not good. The work environment is based on favoritism."
good,"Worked at home. Managed a caseload of clients, assisting with service issues and business concerns. Lots of travel, internal and external meetings. Can be a very political environment."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to help develop staff "
good,management was very one sided and it was a stressful environment i would have to work from home if i ever applied again but the are a company with good benefits but thats it
good,I have to say it is a standard no frills job with minimal benefits and lack of community within the company. The job itself is easy but boring. But I did enjoy what I was doing
good,People were nice but I did not like the job.  They ultimately dissolved most of their home health services as they were not making money as most patients were Medicare.
good,"Job is a great place to work , but its very hard to advance in this work environment . Management is okay but the pay is good but not good enough to live off of"
good,A flexible company to work for. Management need to take classes on how to manage. They micromanage their employees. If they knew how to do the job they manage it would be easier for them to understand the stress the employees went through. Happy and appreciated employees work better for a company.
good,"Typical call center. The add more work for you do with abysmal pay increases and not many opportunities for advancement. "
good,"Cigna is not the worse place I have worked, they are not as strict as other places. they are big on work from home if your job function allows it. Your experience will depend on your department."
good,Ok place to work in good city centre location. The office is old and tired but people stay because of the people more than the job itself. Flexible with working hours
good,"Work/life balance good, only in terms of you leave - you forget about your job until next morning. A couple of events during the year to try and keep everyone happy. Pay is horrible, one of the worst. Pressure and demands are high, training doesn't come even close to what you really be doing. Management is non-existent and incompetent, just relying on staff members. "
good,"If you work hard and find a mentor in this aging institution you have a shot of a career path.  Slowly coming around on all things, the culture is changing for the better."
good,productive work environment. I liked how if you needed help that they cared and tried to meet all of your needs. i can appreciate someone who is willing to have your back in the work environment not only for themselves but for the company as well.
good,It is a relaxing atmosphere. You are expected to meet all requirement's in a timely manner. You are allowed to listen to music on your cellphone with headphones or earbuds.
good,"I know this seems strange, but my biggest complaint is being treated like a number instead of an employee.  In customer service we are taught to put the customer's needs first.  That becomes difficult when management does not do that for it's own employees."
good,Underwriting busy season is a nightmare. The rest of the year is not bad. Management is good except their staffing decisions are poor. Compensation was fine.
good,"Working independently at home on escalation projects. "
good,I worked from home for the last 3 years and left due to a company wide layoff that removed 25 work from home positions.  There was a lot of change over in local management and I was reporting to someone in Baton 'Rouge that I never met.
good,"Size of company allowed for opportunity to try several different assignments.  Typical corporate culture and the pros and cons that go with that.  Nice, suburban location with no parking issues and an easy commute for Farmington valley area."
good,I left this company over 17 years ago so it is not likely the same company as when I was employed there. I learned a lot. I had a lot of autonomy. It was very political.
good,"that's it"
good,"typical day is stressful calls, stressful quotas, workplace culture is unprofessional at times and immature co workers. the positives are the pay and you learn about insurance and how it works,"
good,Cigna was an okay job environment but you were expected to work mandatory overtime for at least 3-4 months out of the year and sometimes wouldn't be told you were expected to work one or both weekend days until Friday this was after working mandatory overtime during the week.  There wasn't a work life balance during those months.  When you had to work that much overtime because of taxes you ended up making less money than you would otherwise which really sucked.
good,"This job was not what I thought.  I stayed longer than I should have.  Roles and responsibilities needed to be more clearly defined.  In addition, training needed improvement.  There is too much to say here.   So urge anyone that is looking at a possibility within this company to think again."
good,First industry job right out of college and it was an amazing experience and I learned so much.  I would recommend them again however they have sold off most of their P & C business so it is mostly the healthcare insurance market place.  I however never would regret getting my start here.
good,Busy call center.  The thing I enjoyed most about Cigna is that I did learn a lot.  I started as a benefit specialist and then went into authorizations.  I think a call center takes a special kind of person.  I am not cut out for that environment.
good,Since I was looking for a WFH job Cigna provided that opportunity.  The Company provided all the equipment and phone.  Really enjoyed what I did with no one looking over my head.
good,"Cigna is a nice place to work, however the dichotomy of socio-economic realities can be disparaging.   Some folks do a lot of really good work and get paid very little, because it is a service industry and their impact is considered low.  While others bank on connections and ""strategy"" work, but rarely deliver on promises and rake in more prosperity because they are in the know.  Keeping others in the dark is part of the game or at least seems to be encouraged.  Training is limited to video for most and scope creep of roles seems to be the standard, so one has to be very careful with understanding what they signed up for.  So I would cautiously recommend the firm but you need to be very purposeful with your approach and have already attained the credentials and experience required to succeed within 90 days."
good,"Very stressful and lack of professionalism within Management Team. "
good,"Cigna is a solid company to work for with great Growth Potential.  Good salary, decent benefits and strong executive leadership."
good,I have to travel in and around daily so I am facing inconvenience in travelling . I seeking for a job in a single area. Anywhere in and around Coimbatore and Tiruppur.
good,Regarding Cigna I loved my co-workers as well as the work atmosphere. One down fall would be the strict scheduling with no flexibility whether it would have been any form of emergency and a number of miscellaneous circumstances that could happen to anyone.
good,"Double standards of expectations of definition of taking care of the customer. Many managers were excellent. However, some were awful. Emphasis on Client Mental Health Care, but not on employee Mental Health Care. Most enjoyable part of job was receiving positive feedback - job well done from Customers."
good,Cigna is a great place to work unless you want to move within the company. The opportunities for better positions within the company are limited. The role is very fast paced.
good,"Great work environment, professional organization, Went through some challenging times with management changes. Good working relationships with team members."
good,"It's okay, healthcare, benefits, PTO, good management, vacations, workshops, advancement, great work environment, structured, accessible, compensation"
good,The management lacks IT strategy and directions to manage outsourcing engagements. Cigna Onshore team is insecure with no control on huge IT spends. There are too many redundant divisions with no coordination and each one of them functions like an independent company.
good,"CIgna offers a nice pay scale - nice time off.  depending on where you are in the company depends on how much you like it.   Advancement is for the very young and while they have woman in high places my experience was mostly young, men advanced rapidly.  The advancements were secret until the move was made."
good,"I liked working here, however Management seems to do a generalization instead of an individual approach when it comes to corrective action. It is an experience that can vary from person to person."
good,"There was no end to the challenges, disorganization and taxing,  long hours in QA.  Big changes came through with new management, which placed more emphasis on automation and offshoring."
good,"Work assignment has quota to make, always updating data to perform job duties better."
good,"Multiple case management teams, experienced poor communication of role of various teams cause confusion when teams tried to figure out what role of alternate teams. Did not have full autonomy in managing daily work, alternate teams are able to schedule work with out my input."
good,"Cigna is a great company to work for however lack in the area of strong leaders.  Due to ineffective leadership a lot of dedicated, hardworking employees were loss which caused a decline in a healthy work environment."
good,Ok place to work...Nice people. Could have been better structured. Compensation was good. Benefits were good and comparable to the insurance claim industry
good,"No Support from within, No job security, Extremely poor training. Would not recommend as a career choice. Unrealistic work quotas. Beware employment"
good,"Wonderful working closely with family practice doctors and optometry. "
good,"Medical benefits here are not great, and advancement is not easy; in fact, they will sometimes block a transfer to other departments, even if you are offered a job.  Also, advancement is based on who you know and are friendly with, not based on one's knowledge or skills."
good,This is a great company. I have worked with the company for 5 years but recent changes in management have made me re-think a career and it has also changed my outlook on the company. I will stay at the company if the 1 year hold is lifted so I can move under new management.
good,"Working at Cigna made me realize that my co-workers were family to me , we all worked very well together. A typical day consist of making coffee checking inventory answering phones, registering patients , making sure patients are not having any issues with transportation. The hardest part of my job I must say was making sure patients were happy and making sure they had everything set up for any future appointments and that the resources they requested were granted."
good,"Their direction is questionable, however the job culture, co-workers, and pay is good. Like most large organizations, is all about the number and the metrics must be met."
good,"Great learning experience, had a Manager that was very open door and wanted her team to succeed, since so many name changes and talk of mergers, Executives and persons in supervisor positions are working together to keep a positive cohesive team together."
good,Still a Cigna subsidiary and therefore whatever is applicable to a typical Cigna review is applicable here. Lack of organization and grim outlook on career advancement.
good,High productivity standards - learned all facets of Workers' Compensation laws and guidelines. an enjoyable time while employed by CIGNA Corp .
good,"Company looks to support charities who share their mission of health and well being, such as March of Dimes.  Company strives for people to improve their lifestyles so that they will achieve better health."
good,Your expected to talk on phones to as many people you can and help out with problems all day long. Your speaking with customers about their benefits and about the claims.
good,I am sure there are more difficult jobs.  The work itself is rewarding however there is a sense that the bottom line or dollars is what is most important to the company.
good,"Cigna gives you good experiance in the healthcare industry, however it is very hard to move up and the compensation could be better. Although they have a preformance based compensation method, I have not seen it happen"
good,"Just a typical work place. It's a great starter company to gain experince. Great work hours, very understanding with personal issues that arise."
good,Worked in a call center environment.  Incoming call center for members and providers.  Relayed benefits to providers for specific benefits.  Went over claims that were paid to the provider with the provider or member.  Sent claims back to processor if claims were not paid correctly according to contract.  Followed up with members when questions were asked that could not be answered on the call. Explained members insurance when they did not understand deductibles and co insurance.
good,"processed medical claims, worked with good people, great training program"
good,"Phones may be busy but it is a pleasant place to work. I am always helping others, never boring always exciting to see the patients smile."
good,"•	Ensure members comprehend  prescription pricing and side effects "
good,It was great call center. helping people learn about their health care benefits
good,Long hours and lots of overtime.  You have to multitask and help out other department.  Lunch and break time can be scheduled at strange hours.  But there are a lot of nice people working there.
good,"A typical day at work consits of assisting members with their medicare/medicade benefits. Working for Cigna allowed me to build patience, the hardest part of the job is not being able to help members at times.The most enjoyable part of the job is that i get to the chance to speak with great people every day."
good,"To be a productive asset to a business where my skills, knowlwdge and great work structure will allow me to be prosperous"
good,"ok place to work, low salary, no room for advancement, antiquated systems, global outreach, dedicatd CEO"
good,"very fast pace. dealing with customer inquiry and complaints and EOB and claims,"
good,overall i liked cigna however there is room for improvement with employee growth and compensation for excellence
good,"some days are really good, others not so much. peoples stories will get to you..cancer, chemo and kids, dying parents, ugh..if you can handle these kinds of calls without crying..this is your job. Co workers and management is there for you and very helpful."
good,took calls worked on computer to get the answers. the hardest part of job was taking 1 call after another no time to breathe.
good,"Plenty of opportunities to learn. "
good,"Cigna is a very large company and promotes wellness, family time and health better than any other employer I have ever been a part of. As far as my career however, I feel that there are constant learning opportunities but due to the productivity requirements, people are rarely considered for them."
good,"Daily I would manually tie any provider information that did not match to what was in our system automatically or load any new provider info not already existing in our system. My quality and production was always high. I've worked there two years, but due to job re-location I will no longer be working there after the end of June 3013. My co-workers were friendly and laid back. The management was always there to help. "
good,"Managed up to 45 Claims Processors at a Claim Service Center. Responsible for all HR functions for the processing time I managed. Tracked productivity, quality, attendance, and delivered performance reviews for team members. Also, assisted and implemented special incentive programs for employees to increase morale and productivity. Assisted with management training and job fairs for the service center. "
good,"My day is always busy, I enjoy what I was doing and take pride."
good,"I enjoyed working in an insurance environment because that is where most of my training is. I did not like the fast pace that accompanied the position because it did not allow alot of time with the customers. The competition was younger and faster and in off shore facilities, working for alot less than we were."
good,"Day Start by meeting With Sales team, to know problem my team is facing ,To Come out with Solution ,and to work on goal we had set"
good,Awsome pay and easy to move up in the company with a good manager who believes in your work ethic.
good,"Worked under the direct supervision of a Registered Pharmacist filling prescriptions, prepackaging medications, preparing I.V.’s according to PharMerica’s standards of quality, customer service, productivity guidelines, and State Board of Pharmacy regulations."
good,worked remotely as off premise worker for several years. Good flexibility within the corporation.
good,"I enjoyed the job, but I wanted to change professions. I would go in and manage caseloads, daily. There was alot of communication with clients via email, and telephone. My co-workers were very helpful. I enjoyed working as a team member too."
good,Good executive culture.
good,I loved my coworkers and working from home it gave me a chance to be with my family as well as an income. There is not alot of room for advancement and salary is lower than average standard.
good,"I really enjoy a position where I have to think, exercise my brain. I also like to be challenged. Cigna certainly met and exceeded both. I learned quite a bit about the inner workings of insurance claims and how they are paid. The quality requirements are stringent and provided the challenge."
good,"While I was there, the company seemed to be in a constant state of change.  Executive leadership came and went, but the workers from the Director level down remained constant."
good,Cigna is a good company to work for. I was laid off due to my position of Senior Advocate was eliminated.My manager was extremely nice and focused on building a successful team.
good,typical day was back to back phone calls of members wanting to know information about insurance plans or checking statuses of claims or employers correcting or sending new employee information to us to get insurance set up
good,Challenging; stressful -- but I made the most of it and did my best.  Disappointed in my compensation.  They said I'd get a raise after 9 weeks -- but it turned out to be 9 months and very little increase.
good,The job itself was just ok. Very convenient bc i worked from home with a flexible schedule but laid off due to “globalization”. They micro manage employees but as long as you’re doing what you’re supposed to do they leave you alone
good,Cigna have a lot to offer but I do not like the politics of the company. I wish I could see more leadership that looks like me. I also wish there was more cultural influences.
good,"I worked as a Temp during their HEDIS project."
good,Lay offs are common. Was laid off from CIGNA and the third party that handles the information is terrible. Very clicky environment. Benefits are average ... you’d think they would be better for employees considering CIGNA is the provided healthcare.
good,"they focus on the bottom line. the member / customer is not at the core of the company's concepts, and they are failing to reflect empathy and fail to excel in the areas of the consumers overall needs, but thrive when it comes to the company needs. unfortunately the company, and its ""brand"" come before the member, and even come before the employees. its all about what we can do for them ….. and there is little concern on what they can do for the consumer"
good,It's not a bad place to work. It's very fast paced. And sometimes stressful. They tell you it's all about the member but they like you to help them within amount of time. If you don't meet that time they will be on you.
good,Stressful taking calls from clocking in to clocking out. You get all the different types of people out there on the phones. There are good days when it's down time which is mid year.
good,Productivity and compliance w/ CMS regulations are paramount.  Offices are close to various forms of public transportation.  The company is flexible in that you can work in the office or work at home.
good,"If you come in during open enrollment, don't make plans for a life during those 3 months. The hours vary based on application volume. Your hours will very greatly based on those numbers. Some days many only be 9 hours while other days can be up to 16."
good,"Job is mentally draining, the insurance prices are not bad but 3200 dollar deductible for your family before Cigna pays. Not so good. Overall a decent place to work"
good,I worked from home and had a lot of computer issues and there was no help.  I would have to drive over a hour one way to one of offices.  There would be scheduled meetings and would cancelled at the last minute.  I feel like there was no leadership.
good,"leadership didnt speak,caused tension between teams, local team didnt speak with leadership. Often forgotten about by leadership. poor leadership not enough resources"
good,"Management told staff to lie to providers, claims were not processed in a timely fashion. Sometimes claims were not processed at all. Management was made aware and did nothing to resolve the issues."
good,"Gathered and processed data for 70,000 randomly selected records over a 12 week period for Health Effective Data and Information Set (HEDIS) involving HIPAA-covered health information from clients in regard to their health care received from CIGNA providers. Accuracy, speed, phone communications, and team interaction made for exciting day to day work and a feeling of accomplishment. Team lead interaction, training and mentoring made the seven years of participating as a temp in the project fulfilling and productive. Accumulated information on covered health care measures was a learning experience in itself regarding the state of current health care in the U.S."
good,"All in all it was a decent job. My position required a ton of travel. I felt I could have used a lot more training, but I made do. The money was decent and I enjoyed not having to be stuck in an office, but airports became very tiresome too. And being away from my family."
good,I don't like having to lie to people or deliver bad news. It's high stress and the processes are vague. I don't feel that there is enough support to provide the best type of customer service.
good,"Available to work in different departments if you are crossed train. Friendly place to work."
good,it was definitely a call center for you. you definitely dealt with the satisfied and the unsatisfied customers on the phone. You came to work and you and made sure that all the customers you could could get the facts on there medication.
good,"I did like the job however there was a general lack of confidence when it pertained to providing insured's with benefit coverage. CIgna does not really take responsibility for their employees or contracted providers providing incorrect info/services to customers and when insureds call about large bills we have to tell them they should have done their own research, etc. Typical day is answering calls daily high volumes... sometimes stressful but hey its a call center. Benefits were good however annual bonuses were based on metrics and sometimes these were difficult to meet."
good,"Cigna has been a great company to work for, but the culture is very stressful and not fair to their employees, as each manager conducts their team differently. I.e., some may work from, others not, even in the same jobs."
good,"Remote position, hours worked 6-3:30, learned additional skills in configuration of systems to allow for provider contracts/billing. Member benefits payments, and a Medicare/Medicaid business. Work culture, fast paced, work processes changed often. Hardest part staying ahead of the changes. Most enjoyable part was staying busy."
good,It was an ok company to work for. I don't like the fact that they micro manage. I like to work with minimal supervisor. I don't want to work there again.
good,You will make it in this job if you have connections. Not much room for advancement and unless you know someone in the area you want to move to. May work for an individual that is complacent.
good,"Helps the day go by fast, management could do a better job of relating to their employees, not be as hypocritical. Everyone works hard to get to a common goal, takes collaboration from the rank and file. Communication and morale need to improve."
good,"The company has a lot of political issues within. I's smaller sibling HealthSpring has even more  problems, but some people thrive is situations like these."
good,I believe Cigna truly wants to change and improve the health care system in the US. It's gratifying to work for an employer with such a brave and lofty mission.
good,Managers are hired with no experience and does not do the job well. The managers have favorites and pick and choose who the rules apply too. The company is not a fair company to work for.
good,"Good job, friendly work environment for the most part good management, favorites sometimes planed, poor salary, not much chance to grow, became mundane"
good,"They don't always have a handle on their teams.  They sometimes get stuck in their ""processes"" and don't move forward with fixing the problem(s) at hand."
good,Typical day at work is coming in and putting on your headset and be prepared to answer calls. The only time you are allowed to get out of your desk is lunch and breaks.
good,"- Job culture is fine."
good,Had an opportunity to take IT knowledge and apply to new technologies while working in fast paced environment. Great opportunity for team work to deliver quality data governance reporting.
good,"Performed data entry of insurance claims and filed/pulled records of claims. Management was new and learning his job, which made it difficult to maintain a ""status quo"". Management laid off some people and combined their work to other compartments (which over time caused a backlog) and some people quit. This job turned out to be the hardest to maintain because of restructuring and lost of key people."
good,"Benefits, PTO Great!! Hard work for average pay, lots of work not enough employees. Management is not as great since I started back in 2010. Should really treat their employees better."
good,"Cigna is a huge company made up of other companies absorbed over the years. Their mission is a good one but the cascade of information can be confusing, and or limited. Good opportunities for advancement, and work from home."
good,"This company provided the opportunity for  nurse medical consulting on short, and long term disability cases. Medical recommendations only, limited decision making on the part of the nurse. The limited medical knowledge of the non-medical case workers was the most difficult to work with. They required frequent in depth information to make their final case decisions. Enjoyed working with the Disability Fraud Team on cases."
good,Customer Service: answering customer calls and assisting them with questions about their insurance. Escalating when necessary to the proper department.
good,"This company is driven to reduce costs of overall healthcare.  The sector that I worked with was in the  medicare department.  The hardest part of the job was trying to provide care and ""encourage"" elderly patients to take their medications correctly."
good,"Once you get into Disability, it’s super difficult to get into another department. The majority of talented workers quit due to lack of advancement opportunities."
good,"working with a company that's helpful, understanding, easy to work with, "
good,"Cigna takes an active and financial role in making the world healthier! As such, I've always been proud to work for them."
good,"Appeals and Grievances- Researches, Reviews and Resolves high level high priority member grievances, appeals and complaints, while clarifying issues and educating members in the process in accordance to CMS Guidelines.  Responsible for Cigna Medicare member’s enrollment, claims, demographics and member issues during Open Enrollment.  Handle all members’ problems and complaints with professionalism and courtesy."
good,"Processing claims on a daily basis, very strict on conversation with other workers.  Was not very informative with explaining the process on processing claims. The part that I did not like was it was very stressful.  What I learned that there are many different claims to learn about and all of them can be difficult."
good,I have learned lots of things like how create the partners and maintains the reports. Personality development. Work culture is very good everyone is very help full. Most enjoyeable is incrntive structure.
good,"The company is not bad but the office is definitely claustrophobic. All outside windows are taken by management offices."
good,"Cigna very stressful. Learned a lot about Medicare and Medicaid, Prescription Drugs,SSI. Learned their CRM system. Assisting CST 50 hours a Wk on phone"
good,Provides claim paying support to major companies.  CIGNA has flexible work schedule and work at home opportunities.  Fast paced atmosphere focused on quality work.
good,Memorable event was back in 1999 when we prepared for year 2000! There were regular meetings leading up to the conversion and everything went smoothly!
good,"I worked here over a decade ago, but it was an acceptable place to work at the time. I wouldn't go back now that I have more experience, but it is good for entry-level position experience."
good,"The project I worked on was very interesting. However, they took a long time in setting up my computer, in fact it was much more than one could think of. Although the colleagues were good, there were some miscommunications between the teams with respect to the end goals of the projects."
good,Felt that company was not focused on current employees and were more likely to look at outside candidates for job placement. Did not provide a team spirit working environment.
good,"was only there a year, so not a good sense of how things are now and if they have changed.  some people were there and didnt want to work and pushed work on others, hopefully that has been changed."
good,"I actually put this review in the incorrect slot. the company was not too bad but the strange thing was they would switch managers around every six months kind of like ""Office Space"""
good,"it was a contract job, so not much i can say about Cigna, the Contractor company was ok. But it was to make money until I could find a better job. If it was a Permanent job, it'd probably been nice. Cigna could have been more team minded by inviting the contractors to participate with them at a picnic or other activity. We were ""CONTACTORS"" they made sure we knew it."
good,The people that I worked with were amazing. Even some of the Management were pleasing. At the time of my employment they were going through alot of changes and kept us switching us from one office to another that were about twenty miles apart.
good,You will be overworked with the work load and long hours. You will sometimes work on weekends. Salary is not great. Employees are usually nice and management as well. Looks great on your resume.
good,I heard about Hedis and what does it means to the Healthcare system.   The hardest part of the job was getting to the job by public transportation.  I enjoyed my co0workers and the atmosphere of the job.
good,"A typical day at work started around 9, ended around 5 and involved making sure that the clients requests that were within reason were met."
good,fast paced environment
good,Horrible turnover within the department. Planned changes that are never followed through successful. Employees have no voice. Overworked and underpaid.
good,"The environment was sort of a slow-paced atmosphere with very little changes.  There was not a lot of variety and a very stern environment. Unfortunately, due to corporate decisions, CIGNA is not accepted at a large number of hospitals for patients with special needs."
good,"Overall rating good.  Work life balance is a struggle.  Compensation is fair.  There is job security at this organization.  The culture of the job is "" change is constant."""
good,this  company no longer exists . good  typical work day. Learned alot.  good management  good  culture. commute was the  hardest. Liked the  pretty drive.
good,I spent 18 years working for CIGNA and the expeience I gained was helpful in expanding my roles at this company. It also hep-0ped moved on to larger roles outside of this company.
good,Taking anywhere from 40-70 calls a day helping people with their health plan and any questions they may have.  A stressful job.A good job for you if you can handle constant pressure.
good,"Worked for the Agile team on a few challenging projects for the web-based application Cigna.com "
good,"I was hired for a special project. The training was haphazard; the trainers did not seem to know the program. The team wound up rewriting the training materials so that they made sense. The special project did not attract any customers, so the team spent all day reading the interesting management articles that were posted on the company website."
good,"It's Cigna - big company, lots of red tape. My immediate team was fine with a few amazing people who I leaned on to learn more. Upper management was solid."
good,"Stressful job,but fun people and good environment. cafeteria onsite, different programs to keep you engaged and healthy at work. Smoke free environment."
good,Cigna was my first customer service job opportunity and they gave me the foundation for my current customer skills. Very organized place with a lot of growth chances
good,"I worked at CIGNA on a temporary assignment, but it is a growing innovative company focused on improving health care.  I would recommend working here."
good,The office location in Happy Valley is owned by USAA.  I did not like how quality assurance staff in Building B as well as quality assurance employees at USAA could track an employees comings and going outside of office on non company time. Unconstitutional!!!!
good,Was a good client to work with. Approachable and was easy to manage the work life balance and good onsite opportunities provided to associates at offshore.
good,The work was fast paced during the busy season. Then it slowed down. The work was very manageable. company is good to work for except the pay. The pay did not compete with other insurance companies.
good,Answered phones calls from very angry people all day every day. People who didn't understand their benefits. I will people would learn their medical insurance.
good,"okay experience"
good,"hard working environment"
good,"Working at Cigna has its ups and downs just like any other place.  In my experience in life - the work is basically the same, just different programs.  People are the same wherever you go - faces change but the people don't.  Its all in how you approach it and how you manage it yourself."
good,"Unfortunately, with a cut throat workforce, you learn a lot about lower classes, education levels, monetary income levels. Favoritism applied as well. I did not enjoy a lot of the work there do to personnel who did not like other personnel.  I did learn a lot about computer research, researching pieces of mail not allowed out in the mailing procedure, using mail delivery systems...UPS, FED EX  etc...Conducted QA interviews and prepared reports. Had to communicate with satellite offices in the US and Europe. Had to maintain  utmost confidentiality with regard to the material we handled each day as well as learn about information security."
good,laid back place to work relaxed environment and good benefits overall not a bad place. Hours holidays and OT available if needed flexible hours ok location if live in north
good,Good place to start but hard to progress to other business units for career growth
good,"inbound call center really fast pace."
good,CIGNA was a good place to work.  I worked in the Behavioral Health Department which ended up being relocated.   The company as a whole has excellent training and good benefits.
good,"Accurately received, researched, and resolved customer/provider inquiries, promoted the retention of the customer base by providing responsive and friendly service, resolved problems with cards or other issues involving insurance in a timely manner."
good,"I often called the customer's doctor office in order to get the proper info needed in order to get their bill paid."
good,"Busy office with lively co-workers, good location, strong team player mentality, Opportunities to excel within the company. Training provided, good benefits."
good,"There were a lot of metrics to meet (average call / hold times, schedule adherence and quality to name a few).  If you didn't meet the required minimums in any one of those metrics disciplinary action was taken: 3 strikes in any one category and you were out.  However if you made all of your numbers you could advance and get bonuses/raises."
good,I work in Precert and am responsible for supporting the Medical Director and Director of Pre-Certification. Responsibilities include  assuring health care services are available to Cigna HealthSpring members in an appropriate cost-effective            manner and delivery of those services to promote healthy outcomes by supervising nurses whom process  authorizations for durable medical equipment (DME).
good,working the grave yard shift was hard because the manager was out on sick leave the majority of the time and the employees had to help one another to get the job done.
good,"There's no training, so learning everything takes about 7 months. There are limits to your growth based on your race. There's a lot of white supremacy ruining the growth for a few of the departments"
good,Since this position was with the sales team most days consisted of looking into new clients and managing the needs for existing clients.  There was a great deal of travel and client meetings.
good,Low energy culture where strong introverts thrive.  Workplace is intentionally designed to avoid interaction among employees.  All meetings are taken on conference calls.  Large amount of workforce is remote yet have a desk at the HQ.  Results in a sea of empty desks and offices.
good,CIGNA is one of the primary companies that everyone wants to work for in the greater Philadelphia area for sure.  Has a decent reputation of employee recognition. Has multiple locations throughout the country to work.
good,It was a great place for me to learn several areas of the healthcare insurance industry. What I learned in each of my roles at Cigna carried me upward and forward through out my career.
good,"Work hard, work alone and work efficiently. Must have computer knowledge or willing to learn. managers are either easy to work with or extremely hard. Culture is very diverse as many people work here."
good,Management could have been more personable. I had a fantastic manager to begin with but had to switch to a different manager mid year. She did not know the systems effectively.
good,"A typical day at work consists of coming in and immediately getting on the phones until your first break, during which time you will assist patients with their benefits and claims information. You are expected to be on the phones at all times while you are on the clock and if at all possible without bathroom breaks. The management in my experience has been fairly good except the constant micro-managing."
good,CIGNA offers a lot of services to their patients and renders sound healthcare. The offices are pleasant environments and there is a good team approach to most of the clinics.
good,"Nice place to work, location was convenient, secured and adequate parking. My experience was pleasant the years I was employed, I would still be there if compensation was better."
good,Benefits were less than desirable - one would think they being the insurance company would at least have decent benefits for their employees; management was difficult to work for
good,"I enjoy working for Cigna however person circumstances meant having to look for another job."
good,I was hired as a HealthSpring employee.  I had a GREAT boss.  Cigna purchased the company and slowly started adding their people and pushing out HealthSpring Employees
good,Managed teams that took inbound calls from medicare members and also providers.  I would handle all major issues and take calls with team.  Good customer service.
good,Not too bad.. I am a contractor at cigna. Portland cigna office is great but cigna as a whole is not a company that works on cutting edge tools and technologies
good,The work experience was good which used all the niche technologies. But the work was a bit fast-paced using agile SCRUM methodology and was a bit stressful at times.
good,"An organization with a focus on delivering on its promises to its customers, clients, shareholders, and employees. Cigna has an outstanding CEO who is visible, transparent, communicative and respected internal and external."
good,We supported 4000k people and made sure they were always up and running. We followed HIPPA and made sure all data was protected. Management kept us up to date with all new projects and assignments. We had to make sure that they were always running and no downtime.
good,"Due to the wonderful trainers and examples of leadership, while it was a contracted position, I had the opportunity and learned a lot. The scheduling made life easy as well."
good,"I have no opinion on this company."
good,Cigna was my first insurance job.  I obtained good training while at this company.  This allowed me to be more marketable and able to provide insurance expertise once leaving this company.
good,Its been over 30 years don't remember much about the job. Large office with many claim reps. Paid medical claims for different companies that had health insurance with GIGNA.
good,Flexible as far as arrival and departure as long as 8 hours completed. Travel 50 percent of time. Staff all wonderful and committed to  company. Hardest part of job was being hired temp position without benefits.
good,"Taking 40 to 50 inbound calls minimal time to help members"
good,Cigna appreciates that someone can roll up their sleeves and get down to work.  There is always lots to do and the pace is busy.  Cigna also values that employees can think for themselves without relying on supervisors or manager.
good,"The job itself strengthen my independent thinking, along with challenged me to work efficiently in a fast paced work environment.    I would have preferred to be interacting with a broader range of individuals than just my co-workers. The benefits of the position were great, but my personal life came second as working long hours which prevented me from spending time with my 8 year old son. Overall, I am grateful to have had this experience and do not regret my time at Cigna."
good,Management is not open to suggestions and doing the right thing to improve their process. And the company is behind in the times and need to update their way of doing things.
good,"Big company with lots of room for growth but high-stress, contentious, combative environment that doesn't foster a high level of collaboration. Decent compensation and average benefits."
good,Cigna was great to work they offered great benefits and wellness programs to employers and their employees.  They people there are great and the company is organized
good,"Cigna is a good place for new college graduates or individuals looking for a career change into a new professional setting. There is little incentive to stay long term with this company as most competitors offer better pay and there is no clear path for advancement. Management makes all decisions for furthering your career seem top secret, while also imposing unrealistic expectations for deadlines. If you are looking for initial experience into the world of insurance this is a good stepping stone."
good,"Working within Cigna brought a mix of emotions on a typical day to day basis. The general feel around the workforce is negative, unmotivated and underappreciated by most."
good,"busy work environment healthcare call center, purchase a division from GreatWest healthcare, I was senior associate then became a supervisor in the call center"
good,Spent a year or so as an administrative assistant.  Work was not evenly distributed.  Those of us who worked hard got more work and those who slacked on the job got less work and there was never anything done about it.  People were promoted that were not qualified.
good,Very good company to work as this is my mother organization gave me opportunity to start my career and gain lot of knowledge and training to become am cross domain expert
good,"	Processed group health insurance claims."
good,"This was my first job in Glasgow so it was a good job to start with to gain Customer Service experience in Scotland."
good,"I would say that if my family did not move to FL in 1987, I would have spent my career there."
good,Process claims that come in and send them back out to be audited by outside auditors and if they come back with mistakes then they have to be corrected and sent back out
good,"Been working for some years have met good people, and have learn alot. So honored to be a part of a great team! I strongly believe the success of Cigna and the collaboration of everyone coming together"
good,"Good Place to work , employment with Cigna has given me the opportunity  that is needed to further my career in the medical field"
good,Management has no clue what is going on with their staff on a daily basis. Favoritism runs ragged throughout. Top performers not rewarded for a job well done.
good,"While I worked there are a contractor I saw some folks move up the ladder. I did not engage with the company folks directly other then those who I came to know and regard as acquaintances or workplace friends. As with any company, there were gripes of one kind or another. But, overall, my impression is from a disconnected person and from my own observation. ""Grass is always greener....."" turns out, many times, to be a fallacy but there are always green patches."
good,Cigna is a high pressure company.  They seem to be more focused on profits than customers or employees. They do not consider a good balance between work and home to be necessary as long as the work gets done. They would rather pay their people to work overtime than spend vacations with their families.
good,Company is good. Just the structure and On the job training isn't that great. Training in general could have been better to prepare us for what was coming but there wasn't enough time for it.
good,This is where I start working even having my studies that time... But it give me knowledge on how to handle and to talk with different kind of people and get use to it.
good,"changing. too corporate"
good,Had two position with this company first four years were great started under bravo then bought out by health spring then Cigna came along and bought out both company's and the company went down hill from that point on bonus were handed out to a select few left company for a brief period of time and took a new position that I do not recommend to any one training was a joke and management expected you to read their minds poor pay and insurance is a joke if you see any position open for medical records scanners look elsewhere not worth the headache.
good,Came in and did my work.  Was able to work on special projects with other managers.  Co-workers were very friendly.  Management were very knowledgeable.
good,"Cigna is a good compay to work for.  However, there is not much flexibility in schedule.  Company is extremely micro managed."
good,"Work is not much stressful"
good,"Having worked for Cigna Medical Group during two different periods of my life, it was interesting and educational to watch as the company went through many transformations. Most recently, I was thrilled to be a part of their achieved goal of going global. "
good,"great company and staff but it was a lot of work for the pay I was the only one providing at that the time my family, I need more  needed a job to use all my skills and experience the best possible I want to advance in job."
good,I enjoy the team of people I work with. Upper management doesn't stay long. Its a revolving door. I have learned a lot and have been there for a long time. Love the co-workers
good,"As a Customer Service Advocate you are only given a ten minute break in the afternoon and on Friday's you are given 2 ten minute breaks.  Typically in this position you take approximately 70 calls a day, it is almost impossible to receive assistance while on the phones.  As a Qualcare/Cigna employee your experience is not recognized and no matter your education or experinece they tend to stick most people in Customer Service, which is almost impossible to get hired out of that department.  "
good,i enjoyed working on the insurance claims was very interesting to see what came across my desk. i was able to do many different programs to determine if the claim was payable or not.i mostly paid high dollar claims from hospitals.
good,"The company is now under new management, the hours have increased due to mandatory overtime. The benefits are not exactly suitable for the average empoloyee, you come on as a Temp to hire. The management does not communicate with each other or with the employees with direct action. Each person does something different."
good,I had a very good experience working for Cigna. they are a very good company to work for and through my difficult journey of my mother's illness they were very supportive
good,"A typical workday is very full, as there are always many assignments.   I learned a lot in this role which helped me to transition to next stages in my career.   I worked for Cigna for many years, and it was a great experience."
good,Hours from 2 a.m. to 10 a.m. were very hard to get used to. The main offices were on the East Coast so we worked their hours just in California.
good,"I did not enjoy working at Cigna.  "
good,"It is very difficult to advance from a high Band 3 position to Band 4 within this department. As with any job there is the good and bad. There is a lot of good, which is why I have remained in this position for almost 10 year. However the healthcare industry is constantly changing and CGHB does not have the systems in place to help its employees meet market demands in a timely fashion. As much as I make suggestions for improvement the money and support from other departments is lacking preventing the needed enhancements that would provide efficiency and better quality proposals. The people are great to work with however the corporation is so big they focus on the customer experience, the member, not so much their employer who purchases the coverage. If management prefers your personality and ability to deal with the stressful environment you will succeed and move up the career ladder. If you are seen as someone who is challenging and demanding then advancement is not provided."
good,"I started out enjoying working for Healthspring.  The manager that hired me was very easy going and very intelligent in the coding field.  However, There was a ""click"" at Healthspring that made life hard on the people that were not included in that click.  I went through 3 managers during my 2 years while employed there and I wasn't treated fairly.  I left because I knew I would never grow within Healthspring.  I was no longer happy there.  Even working from home I wasn't happy so I started looking for another job."
good,"The company supervisors did not do much to support staff members. Otherwise, pay was okay and vacation was fine as well."
good,"My current position enhanced my decision-making skills and trained me to manage manpower such as supervising them to what to do. My co-workers in my designated department is enjoyed to be with, they celebrate each employee's birthday and having our bonding outside when there is a free time."
good,Good working environment and medical benefits are excellent. Should improve on salary and advancement of staff. Processes should be in place. No other comments.
good,Company is very diverse. they encourage self growth and provide you online tools to do so.  People are fun and hard working.
good,"Personally, I was not a fan of sitting at a desk all day every day. It's not the most engaging job. This may be suitable for some but not for active types like myself."
good,"Highly motivated individual interested in a great customer service career to succeed in."
good,"OK work place, good place to work. Management concept looks good on paper but not practiced managers, mostly its a show of power."
good,"Apparently the company had changed a lot shortly before I started working here. I started in June of 2015, less than a year of a change in upper management and a new system rolling out which we work claims out of. With this new system comes a lot of bugs and issues that make work more difficult. The company is going through a transition having been bought out by Anthem Insurance within a month of my hiring, the future direction of this company is a mystery and it shows around the office, also our entire department recently had an unsatisfactory audit which can affect the Anthem buy-out and upper management is really on edge. It can be difficult getting assistance from upper management as the directors are on their backs and unfortunately the associates take the brunt of it because we are trying to service the customers as best as possible."
good,"Good place to work, very interesting coworkers.  I am a fast learner and so organization is not a problem for me either.  Most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers calling in everyday."
good,"I currently work at home which requires more diligence than working in the office but I do enjoy it. Management it on a constant roller coaster of change and training is not very well organized or readily available, most changes are sent by email with no actual training classes. I currently work four 10 hour days which is beneficial for me so I can continue advancing my education, unfortunately my schedule requires that I work all 52 weekends per year. I enjoy many of the customers I work with on a daily basis and have a personal sense of satisfaction when I can fulfill their requests and answer their questions."
good,"The company needs to finish the transfer. It is trying to localized, but it seems to have a hard time on doing that. The management level is rather giving orders than being open minded to encourage team work."
good,"Was a good company to work for while I was there. I was a customer assoicate on the phone ..  my daily task as answering phones and helping out the members and providers with status on claims, sending claims down for adjustments and looking up precerts. I also quoted benefits and did the open enrollments when members were going to choose their medical plan., I also handled the flexspending accounts and also the hsa accounts too."
good,"A typical day at work consists mainly of telephonic Health Risk Assessments to all active, newly enrolled, and annual members. After completion of assessments, document appropriately and categorize to appropriate case coordinators for further review. The hardest part of the job is sometimes not being able to locate actively enrolled members. The most enjoyable part of the job is working closely as a team to achieve one goal."
good,The best part of working with this company is the work at home option that I have. I do miss my coworkers but the flexibility of working at home is fantastic.
good,"A typical day at Cigna :"
good,"Very fast-paced at times; lots of opportunities for learning; Demanding practitioners; a lot of the usual client and corporate issues; No strong leadership, which can be frustrating"
good,"This is an excellent company to work for. Enjoyed handling my workload on a daily basis and meeting the  team goals/expectations with meeting the requirements of CMS . I learned about Medicare dealing with Appeals/Redetermination Durable Medical Equipments and PartB. It was a great team, management, and experience."
good,Overall good firm to work at and I learned a lot about Big Data and Health Care; Some interesting projects and opportunities for success.
good,"Cigna was a good company, it was just too far of a commute for me and the hours of work did not work with my classes Their medical was good and the campus was great."
good,"•	Received inbound calls from customers concerning their medication description, confirmed eligibility and copays.  "
good,Training and communication between managers and representatives could be a lot better. Most of the training for new areas consisted of 1-4 hours of slides and very little hands on or side by sides
good,"usually busy which was very nice because it kept you on your toes, management was very helpful and also the co-workers. nothing was difficult about the job because I always like challenges which made it fun."
good,"The pay was really great. Down side, my case management patients were ALWAYS mad due to the lack of insurance benefits and coverage for certain healthcare costs and needs."
good,"I worked there for two years and the atmosphere was like walking on egg shells. There was little to no room for errors, accuracy is a must if you work at Cigna Global Health Benefits."
good,Helpful in maintaining and problem solving of patient care.  Monitoring patient care and review patient care for barriers
good,The most enjoyable part of my current assignment is the ability to build working relationships with some of our internal and external customers. I enjoy problem solving and am very customer focused.
good,"Great company to work for if you are not a temporary employee."
good,"great co-workers and supervisors, company cared about employees health and well being, company really cared about their members"
good,"I'm not going to go into detail because this is my second review for Cigna, but I worked in 2 different departments there, and both was very informative."
good,"Great company to work for if you're one to develop yourself. Claims is what you make it. Management is similar to most carriers in corporate America. Flexibility is good. If you work hard, your efforts will be noticed."
good,"Over all a great place to work. I've learned a lot about researching guidelines at a faster and easier why.  Smoother professional practice with EMRs, HIPPA, and CMS guidelines.  There has been a lot of employee turnover but generally the staff is professional and well diversified.  The most enjoyable part is the opportunity to work remotely twice a week."
good,Enjoyable organization to work for.Leadership is fair. Career development and customer satisfaction is the focus of this work environment.
good,Ability to learn and grow within this company has been a hugely rewarding in my career. With over 16 years of healthcare administration experience with a focus on Medicare Advantage.
good,"I handle dental calls in regards to claims, benefits and eligibility. Coming from a healthcare background, I have learned so much about dental and the different procedures. I really enjoy my co-workers."
good,I loved working for Cigna Healthspring. I loved my management and my co-workers. A very nice enviorment
good,"co workers and supervisor makes you feel like a family, part of the team loved it"
good,"Great place to work, with good co workers. The hardest part of the job is not taking it home and the work-life balance.  The demand for service is very high and can be a very stressful at times."
good,Left for personal reasons. Worked 40 hours a week and had a good working relationship with co-workers.
good,"A very stressful company to work for, been here  7 years on Jan and am ready for a change."
good,Cigna is a great place to work. They truly value their employees. training is 14 weeks which was detailed in processing claims and learning CPT codes and HCPC codes and teaching customers how to find health care providers in their network for the health care needs of the member and their families.
good,"Good place to get a start in property/casualty business, good growth opportunities."
good,"I like calling and being able to talk to diffrent people on the phone, and helping them to figure out a solution for their problem."
good,I learned a lot on how to develop insurance programs for Fortune 500 clients
good,"Good People"
good,"Over time, working for the company I have gained and improved the skills needed to prepare for further opportunities."
good,"Over time, as I worked with HealthSpring and Cigna-healthspring, I have gained and improved necessary skills to prepare me for further opportunities."
good,"I started with calling leads and setting appointments. Then I went to meet previous appoints that were set earlier. At this time, I practiced my skills at educating my clients and saw ways to bridge the gaps between what we had to offer and the clients needs. Or even if CIGNA was a good fit for the clients. I practiced a lot of patience and listening skills. I liked meeting with clients to see what their thoughts were. Management was a good help in tutoring me as were some of my more experienced colleagues. But the hardest part was that I did all I could and some of my clients would not enroll, even after follow up. But I also know that this is the way sales and client services can be. Up and down, but go with the flow because it will all work out somehow. I learned to take stress in stride."
good,Called on brokers to discuss prospects and possible fits with Cigna. Worked with underwriting and management to position cases to sell.  Presented to broker and clients to close sales.  Learned how to manage entire sales process.  Had great relationship with co-workers.  Most enjoyable part of job was closing sales.  Hardest part of job was getting groups to move to Cigna when they were having no issues with their incumbent carrier.
good,"At any corporate company there are strategies which at time are not given to those who carry out the day to day work. A typical day is full of meetings, reviews, analyzing charts & correspondence. Management is competent in their teams work ability, no micro-managing. Hardest part of the job is having to work extremely long hours to complete all task just to ensure that days work doesn't carry over."
good,Great place to learn things quickly however being micro managed was not about to migrate to other departments.
good,Advancement is difficult as you are tied to a position for two years.  Limited to 5% raise increases and subject to a rating system that is skewed to favoritism.
good,"Busy call center--Inbound/Outbound calls; Outbound emails completed; Fair Management, but high turnover rate; High employee turnover rate; No retention program; Co-workers very personable and pleasant; Great updated new state of the art facilities including new catered/staffed cafeteria & gym;"
good,NO review at this time. Very busy day at work.  I know all about healthcare.  Management is okay. I enjoy my coworkers. The customers. The enjoyment of satisfying a customer.
good,You have good balance between work and home. Flexible schedule  they will work with you.  Some people can work from home.
good,Very professional work environment with very talented resources
good,"diverse employee population, fast paced environment.  employees and managers worked well together"
good,I am very competitive and push myself to make sure the customers needs are always met.  I work very well with everyone and always keep and open mind for change and improvement.
good,Cigna HealthSpring is a good company that someone can learn from. They are always progressing in the Medicaid/Medicare field.
good,"Enjoyable coworkers, decent starting salary, however, not enough room for advancement"
good,Great company to work for. I really enjoyed working for Cigna and am sadden that I've been laid off.
good,"I learned how medical claims are processed, medical terminology."
good,"Co-workers were friendly,fast-paced environment. Very busy during enrollment season"
good,Typical call-center/cube farm with people doing the same thing day after day.  Management had unrealistic expectations and pushed people further than they needed to.
good,Open enrollment is very busy time of year. Stay on top on new changes and learn as much as you can. Co-workers made great team work.
good,"Work for the company for years.  For the most part my years with the company were good, but did encounter managers that could use more exposure to interpersonal skills."
good,It been over ten years since I worked at Cigna. The job was very busy.
good,"Loved the co-workers and management, but did not like the lack of inside advancement or job function. I took disability claims in a call center type atmosphere with mandatory overtime."
good,Good experience for a short term position- I experienced a great deal of team work during my time there
good,Answer all calls in que inlcuding Spanish and help the members with their medical claims and questions.
good,"A typical day was answering phones for 7.5 straight hours answering medical questions on benefit -policies and claims. "
good,"As extension of my prior role that began in 2008, the involved both provider data as well as the implementation of a new ""Rewards for Performance"" payment system"
good,A decent place to work but a lot of turnover due to pressure to perform rather than take care of the customers needs. Too much manager clicks and favoritism. Hard to move up in the company.  Daily changes to policy and procedures regarding the coverage guidelines and not enough time to learn them so many people on different pages quoting different outcomes to customers.
good,A typical day as a recruiter at healthspring was being able to hit ground running.
good,There is no typical day in the insurance day. You have very slow times of year and extremely busy times of the year.
good,"I have been with Cigna for 4 years. My job duties are medical billing, working with providers and members and making sure we get the claims out on time and correctly and give our members the best service we can. I learned so much about medical billling and the coding and procedure codes we use there. They do need improvement in management and fairness in the job. I enjoy working and helping others I consider myself a good employee and reliable and work well with others."
good,"Positive Experience and I am learning a lot."
good,"Overall a good experience working there.  Over the years I was promoted several times due to management recognition of ability to broaden my skills.  I worked with many pleasant and professional people during my tenure there.  "
good,"Fast pace, Multiple Tasks with many responsibilities in the Contracting and Licensing of Insurance Agents, I learned, Credentialing, Background search, Validate license, Appoint or Terminate agents with the state. Mail out notification of each as well as electronic email.  Paperless environment with dual monitors.  Management is ok.  I worked independently notes from other coworkers in system for every agent for reference.  Hardest part is when we receive multiple contracts for new products and working to make deadlines but it is done in a timely manner as humanly possible."
good,"Very fast past daily quota of 60 appeals daily."
good,They pay great for the work you do. Very large issues is upper management. They care nothing about their employees and expect more than they should. They do not care about the customers that pay their bills. Overall they care about the money in their pocket and nothing in yours or the customers.
good,Cigna is a corporation with a highly dynamic and constantly changing work force at all levels.
good,"Cigna holds high standards for their customers by implementing an efficient staff. "
good,limited scope to move ahead in career. didnt have the best experience there
good,Typical call center environment; no other relevant comments......
good,"Too bad the culture from the east coast hasn't met Colorado.  There are some fun things going on there, with some great team mates, but wouldn't recommend it."
good,"I am hard working person and easy get along with everyone.  My relevant experience with handle different type of medical claims: (such as Hospital bill, Anesthesia bill) and also helped other units such as "" Tier I, Tier II, Tier III and Clerical Department).  I enjoyable working with my co-workers like a family."
good,HealthSpring is a good company and values the thoughts and opinions of employees.  
good,"Great co-workers, good team, nice peers and challenging work."
good,"Good environment, opportunities for personal development and growth"
good,I went through the underwriting training program and went to become a very successful underwriter.  
good,Worked with cients and brokers to ensure successful benefits program
good,Pretty decent company to work for if you work in the right department/area. Great employees and some good managers.
good,Training is well done. Stress on Productivity and quaity.Co worker are team players. I enjjoy working from home.
good,Decent pay and benefits. Lower management will bend over backwards for you. Not big on building rapport between employees. On calls entire shift.
good,As a claims manager you will work non-stop from beginning of your shift until end and mostly need over time to meet expectations.
good,"Pros – paid time off, good cafeteria, work from home opportunities"
good,"Responsible for day to day application support activities as well as development of enhancement and project level implementations. Experience with online, batch, and distributed applications."
good,Company seems quite set in their ways albeit some good things have occurred such as the campaign to use language that is easier for the customer to understand.
good,"I learned a great deal about health insurance which has been extremely useful, even in my personal life."
good,"busy from start to end of each day , rush rush, . it starts out alright- available help after training is limited. you train for more systems and are not compensated"
good,"A typical day at work was logging on the system 10min before the shifted stared also logging into the phones. I had to work with several programs in Citrix and each one requiring a log in. Then I had to log into my work station to determine which bridge I was working on, then switch my phone to available, then the calls would start coming in immediately. I learned that sometime computers can crash and that it is very difficult to help customers when that happends. I learned that management was very encouraging and supportive when we (Customer Services Reps) had a very difficult customer. My co-workers were wonderful, we had all gone through the training together, and understood what each other was going through on a professional level. The hardest part of the job was having to learn all of the programs at once in a small amount of time, and learning your way around the different systems. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting some wonderful teammates, and I did learn some new things about the Dental Program such as; dental codes, frequencies, deductables, and limitations. It was very interesting."
good,"good place to work,wish this location hadn't closed,not the greatest communicating with all employees."
good,"A typical day at work would include front desk coverage, coordinating meetings, resolving computer issues, monitoring supply inventory, assisting sales department with data entry needs, creating reports and correspondence for executive team. I learned how to step outside of the typical administrative support by assisting all departments with various projects."
good,enjoy my job and like a detailed set environment. Sometimes it seems it is a little too strict. when they say 15 minute break they really min 10 min due to having to deal with everything and having to be right back at your desk on the dot or a manager is calling you. i do well with authority and find that i work well by not being micromanaged. I enjoy working with different cultures and like meeting new people!
good,I have enjoyed my employment and would like to take the knowledge I have learned and use to advance my career
good,"This is was the first employer where there was opportunity to have a flex schedule, based upon performance."
good,"A typical day starts with mail intake where we sort the mail by regions and slice it open thru a slicing machine. Mangement passes the mail out and it is sorted by single claims, correspondence, etc. Once opened and sorted, it is scanned into the database so we can process the claims and corr. I have learned how to process medical claims and what it takes to get the claim processed. Management is okay they don't hover over you but let you do the job that you are assigned to that day. I help my coworkers in any way possible when needed and we all are willing to get the job done in a timely manner. The most important part of the job is knowing that you are helping the beneficiary of the claim or provider get their claims processed to have the insurance company pay their part. The hardest part is when we don't meet our individual production metric."
good,Company needs to give new employees more time to train regarding achieving expertise in advanced computer applications in order to meet their metrics.
good,"Cigna is a great place to work if you are raising a family, they do offer flexible scheduling and work at home positions for a few jobs. Management is so-so, like all companies there appears to be alot of nepotism and a good ole boys club. Also even though you get good reviews don't be surprised to only get a 1-2 percent raise yearly and don't get angry when they hire new people for the same job you are doing for thousands more per year. When you complain they will tell you they need experienced people..once you are experienced apparently they could care less. Its pretty much a morale buster."
good,Cigna always provides great service to customer as far as helping them understand their Insurance.They are always improving their company to better serve their customers
good,"I worked for CIGNA for 5 years. It was a company which allowed me to promote based upon my experience, but it had some financial challenges that resulted in frequent lay offs and unstable management structure."
good,"Like most employers, job satisfaction is largerly determined by the employee's immediate supervisore and co--workers. I had very good and very bad managers. On the whole, employees are engaged and colleagial. Unfortunately, job security is also in doubt as the company places profitability as the top of the culture to meet shareholder's quarterly expectations."
good,"I was a good plae to work for but I needed more money so found another job to work at. People were nice, atmosphere was fun."
good,It was a contractual  position during their transition to a new system .  Working with the member  to process  their request for  pharmacy reimbursement was rewarding .
good,"Great culture and good people to work with. Employee engagement is high on the agenda."
good,"The people are great! However the work can be bland and repetitive. "
good,"Company is constantly changing and adding to your work load.  they are more focused on ""numbers"" than putting the customer first .  Their expectations are unreachable"
good,I worked from home while working at Cigna. Working from home provided great opportunity for me to balance my work home life. Although it often left me feeling alone.
good,"This is a fast-paced environment that makes many changes regularly.  Phone conversations with customers regarding health care benefits, claims, eligibility, and authorizations.  You will be able to maintain this position if you have thick skin.  Customers are regularly upset, condescending, and at times verbally abusive.  My managers have been a great support system when dealing with difficulties in this position.  I found it hard to advance from Customer Service into other areas of the company.  I continually received high customer surveys, met goals, etc.  I feel the people that get promoted are tight with management."
good,"No room for advancement, stiff environment lots of red tape to get projects done. Resistant to change culture but the benefits package, composition and work at home flexibility is ideal for parents."
good,"Jobs for you if you like sitting on the phone all day. Every move is watched. Even how long you go to the bathroom. You can't call off unless you have vacation time accrued, otherwise your on a 30 day verbal. They hound about metrics and make you gain their trust. They want to know all your feelings about the job so they can make the place better and fire for you for doing so."
good,It was a good working experience.Use of new technologies.The hardest part  of the job was timing with offshore team.Heavy work load every day due to the complexities of the project.
good,"I have worked for Cigna for more than 9 years. I love my job and what I do. I feel I am able to make a real difference in our customers life’s. We have recently purchased Express Scripts. With this purchase our pharmacy platform has moved over from Cigna to Express Scripture. They have decided to terminate our current roles and positions within Cigna. We are in a state of not knowing and are not getting any information from our leadership on what our real options are. Cigna as a whole I feel is a great company to work for, unfortunately we just don’t know what our"
good,"The environment itself can be fun and motivational but the job itself is beyond what anyone should put up with for they pay the offer. Advancing is  unbelievably hard to do, management is terrible. They aren't there for you or can't help you because they don't know the job itself and playing favorites is very common as well. Yet they will break down what you do wrong without helping you to better things correctly. They are a fun-loving, awesome workplace on the outside and a huge, awful ball of stress and disorganization in all actuality."
good,"you come in and you're expected to be on the phone all day with two 15 minute breaks, one thirty minute lunch and very limited bathroom usage so that you can make 40 calls a day."
good,"Too many bosses and not enough worker bees.  Before I left in Dec 2017, I was doing two jobs, support to prov service reps as well as support to projects occurring within the company, requiring too many roles as a “SME” (subject matter expert). The worker bees, band 3 roles are spread thin across the corp and band 4 positions are abundant with people who didn’t work as hard!"
good,"It was a fast paced work in environment , where you were expected to work independently and solve issues. It was a great learning experience, but I felt there was little room for growth in the company."
good,Overall it was an ok job. It paid ok and the work was interesting. It was very quick paced but I thrived in that environment. I would recommend it to friends.
good,The Contracts department was fun to work for and was flexible with the working hours. The people in the department were fun and it was diverse. It got a little frustrating managing the accounts.
good,"Cigna overall has a good mission (keeping people healthy) and its Executive Management inspires.  That said, there is little investment made in innovation.  "
good,"There were several times when I had sent an email to the manager and I knew that the manager had opened it but not respond to me and since I didn't get a response from manager, I would make a decision on problem/situation, management wasn't happy with my decision.  The good thing about the job was working with the physician's offices.  They were always very nice and helpful. They made me feel like I was a part of their office. Also, my co-workers were awesome and we had excellent communication with each other."
good,"Experience in hEDIS nursing, good atmosphere,flexibility working from home . wonderful learning experience and meeting different people and getting an excellent training from staff"
good,"leave your caring and nursing ethics at the door as they are only interested in saving money to create bonuses at the end of the year. very high pressured, your work is scrutinised, your achievements are not celebrated, only your ""human error"" mistakes."
good,"8 hour work days"
good,Everything here works as it should. Just an awesome work environment with awesome people. Indeed will be the top name in the job search/recruitment game for a long time.
good,"This job/career started out as a fabulous opportunity for me.  As time went on I did very well and was promoted several times.  In the beginning of my second year there however, my office was closed and I was transferred to Visalia where I knew virtually no one and had trouble adjusting to the job culture there.  There were no other men in the office and I didn't have much in common with the mostly married middle aged women who worked there."
good,"My job is challenging, it encourages me to learn more on a daily bases, which was the most enjoyable part for me, the most difficult part of my job is having to come into an environment that makes you feel like you do not belong. Other than that disappointing feeling within management, I love Cigna overall."
good,The job itself was cool but didn't care too much for the pay and the workload. Management could have have been more empathetic as well. I think the company is great but they should train management on how they should treat the employees.
good,"Although it may seem to be a great company to work for, if you are in provider services, its different. The lack of advancement from provider services and the lack of help from the supervisors is overwhelming."
good,The job was stressful. We had s goal to reach every month. If it was not met then we would get into trouble. I do reach my goal. I'm looking for something new.
good,As the years went by I lost my job security with Cigna. Now I'm trying to venture out into new career endeavors. I have nothing bad to say about the company.
good,"Not great experience, though well paid, very slow paced.. old technology, older process, have not learned much new stuff which pulled my career back.."
good,"The call could consists of a customer calling in to create a new account on the Cigna website, calling to verify their benefits, calling about the incentive program or overall information about their health plan (which doctor is in network etic). The hardest part of the job would have to be the lack of training done. The trainings are 17 weeks with more than half of those trainings your are taught about an entirely different part of Cigna that you never hired for. Then the last couple of weeks, you are trained on the actually position that you were hired for. I would describe the work place culture as too micro managed. Everything is timed. The hardest part about the job is not being able to answer all the questions your customers have. The most enjoyable part of the job is the online training. You get to interact with the trainings and learn something new."
good,The training is not what they tell you. It can be a hostile work environment. Management isn't helpful. Although the pay is good along with benefits..
good,great training class. Once out of training you are constantly on the phone. There are people there to support you but you often have to wait 30 min or more for an answer but arent given time to call customers back with info that day.
good,Cigna is a great company to work for. The organization works hard to help employees plan their career path through development training and mentorship coaching.
good,Decent company to work for due to the benefits provided. Keep in mind to have a plan going in and do not let the influence of your peers inflict any negative conflict of the perception of the company.
good,As a supervisor our management was often not on site which caused some concerns. Pay and benefits were very competitive. Good work environment. They were behind in the technology of the industry but had a good vision and direction on the insurance end of things.
good,"Cigna is a company with a diverse workforce.    There is plenty of opportunity for innovation, and this is encouraged.  New technology abounds, and there are always opportunities to get in on the leading edge across all the organizations.  You will not be bored here, as there is always plenty to learn, and dynamic leadership with many ideas on ways to make our customers healthier, while at the same time improving quality of care and cost of care."
good,A typical day at work begins with finding out what qualified sales lead I have. Then I set the appointment and hopefully the leads turns into an appointment and eventually a sale.
good,Cigna HealthSpring is an OK place to work.  HealthSpring is the Medicare and Medicaid division of Cigna.   It is a very large organization and you have to sell yourself constantly as a result.  Management has changed regularly over the past two years.
good,"Job files were received on a regular basis and required in depth evaluation, problem solving and follow-up.  I enjoyed the challenge of completing the job assignments on a timely fashion with the expectation of precision.  Management allowed employees to work on an independent nature with little or no close supervision, expecting employees to carry out their duties.  The most difficult part of employment with this company was the increase in mandatory overtime during busy times of the year.  Co-workers were amiable and I enjoyed working with them."
good,Started out really enjoying my job but the longer I worked I gained more responsibility which is a good thing but not when it is for the same pay as someone doing way less.
good,"I process insurance claims after the pharmacists approve them.  My job is to close them out.  I also work in IRE, which are out of compliance cases.  Once cases expire they are packaged and sent to another company to process.  My job is to get the files together.  I've learned a great deal about insurance, the processes, requirements, and time frames.  Management is there, but not active in technicians day-to-day duties.  The culture is very lax.  We can have cellphones,music, jeans.  I like that part very much.  The hardest part of my job is tolerating some of my team members who are not professional and caring.  Also, getting pulled in several different directions (being taken off an important task to do another task that is not as important) is stressful.  Overall, my job is enjoyable.  There is always work to be done, but sometimes the OT can be overwhelming, because they want so much of it."
good,"A good place to work for those wishing to advance their career internationally, however its let down by limited opportunities to progress within the UK."
good,"While I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Cigna, there are a few things that I could have done without. I felt as though on the Production Floor, there was no real way to move forward and stay in that division. Not to mention, there is a real lack of follow through. When I started, I was supposed to be trained so that I could function in different roles but that training never happened. Again, the people were great, the managers not bad and the lack of follow through awful."
good,The time I spent at Cigna was enjoyable as I was constantly being trained on new products and software to make the job less manotonous and to make it easier as a whole. Throughout my time there I made several connections with fellow peers and enjoyed my down time speaking with them and sharing ideas about the job itself.
good,Cigna is a large company that provides excellent service to their customers. Cigna is a company that allows you to work from home after a year or 2.
good,"Great benefits, overall good company to work for. Would recommend company to others. Opportunity for advancement and provided continuous opportunity for learning."
good,"In my area, ramping up as a new employee in a new company and a new position was expected to be very fast."
good,"I was working for CIGNA through TechMahindra LTD."
good,Good place to work but acquisition by Anthem lowered morale with pending job eliminations. Co-workers very helpful and willing to assist which was good.
good,"good company to work for, but long hours on the phone with not enough breaks.stressful at times. good benefits and management team."
good,"Receives requests by telephone regarding insurance claims/policies and also in regards to order status and refill of prescriptions."
good,"I have learned about all aspects of business during my tenure at Cigna. I have had the opportunity to work and develop rich experience in:"
good,"Assisting customers, learned how to review claims, co-workers were supportive. Hardest part of the job is not getting help from management regarding an unfamiliar situation. The most enjoyable part of the job is talking to customers."
good,"It is a nice place to work."
good,Good company overall. Advancing from within is somewhat difficult. Great Experience.
good,Salary was not competitive for my position especially being in Philadelphia.  I was not challenged and left after two years.  I left for a similar position out of city (no city wage tax) for almost $20K more after bonus.
good,"Medical , Dental benefits are lacking.  Be prepaired to work long hours if exempt.  Overall great team environment in the same position.  Enjoyed solving problems for complex accounts, improving our customer experiences and making a difference, which under a decent manager is recognized."
good,"My day at work went as follows. I came in signed on to the phone took calls from providers wanting claim status or benefits."
good,"Loved my immediate supervisors, enjoyed the nature of the work and my co-workers."
good,I learned so much here. It was challenging at times but I grew so much working here.
good,Hourly part-time employee. Work day is relatively flexible as long as I meet my expected weekly hours.
good,"An Insurance company with managers who struggled to make a contract agree with their prior expierence (TPA).  Co workers who try to interpret a contract  based on their prior expierence, no Plan Booklet was available,"
good,CignaHealthSpring is a newly combined company so rating the combined company I prefer HealthSpring as an employer to Cigna based on their family based benefits. Cigna is a better company to work for as a whole when it comes to educating it's employees and enstilling knowledge in them.  As a Cigna employee I learned more about the insurance business from a retail aspect.  Both companies encourage employees to join the managment education team once the opportunity presents itself.  An assisted learning program through team work from coworkers as a team building project was an added team building exercise.  The most enjoyable part of my day was making sure our members are receiving the best care possible.
good,"An average day as a short term disability claim manager involves contacting physicians, claimants (disabled persons), and employers. A claim manager contacts physicians to obtain the documentation necessary to decide whether or not a claim can be approved and disability benefits are permissible. The claim manager then relays this information to the claimant and the employer. The process has a number of variations and secondary responsibilities but the above is the sum of it. At times, the job feels more like a call center than a claim processing position. A claim manager constantly receives calls from claimants regarding various aspects of their claim. Resources could more appropriately be managed by having these inquiries handled by an actual call center."
good,"I've worked for this company since 2008, starting in customer service. The work environment is one of high expectations and constant evolution, but if one embraces it like i did and performs what is necessary, people will notice. For this reason, i have continued to expand my role and duties with the hope of contributing as much as possible. However, i have been disappointed in the lack of support and training as most of the learning was done through trial and error."
good,"I was with Cigna for a short period of time, but enjoyed the work environment and enjoyed learning from others."
good,The best part about working for Cigna is their benefits package.
good, Worked as the Group Test Lead in carrying out the User Acceptance testing.
good,I am a person who likes to help others. I sometimes fill in for the Tech Coach to answer questions
good,"A typical work day is answering calls about benefits, claims, eligiblily."
good,"Working back office MA and learned how to abstract charts. The hardest part of this job was learning the new electronic system was a little difficult, most of all I enjoyed working with Cigna through the temp agency."
good,"Not a bad place to work, but there is a lot of push to outsource."
good,"Process medical, transporation and various claim type. Some of the people will do team work but too many clicks . The most difficult part of the job is meeting the productions of 200 claims per day regardless of the claim type. I enjoyed being part of the many support organizations with the company."
good,"I currently am the only quality coordinator nurse here in the RGV for Heealthspring, since we just expanded in March 2012. A typical day for me is review what we call QOC, qualtiy of concern issues, these are ANY dissatisfaction expressed by our members, whether it is with facilities, providers, doctors etc."
good,I always felt the customer was at the center of everything we did. Management was on top of access to care issues and always provided the support I needed to help the customer.
good,"Overall the work is manageable, high volume call center can get hectic at times. Great sense of diversity in the office and coworkers are usually in good spirits. Biggest negative about this place is the Poor management!"
good,"Pros: "
good,It saves as a start of my career. Train me on MYSQL server and verture studio. Writing quaries and developing work strategies. Have a good working environment with 8+ team members
good,"Cigna was a great place to work for.  It is a big company, so there are plenty of opportunities to advance.  They offer their employees decent benefits."
good,"The call center is a very stressful place; back to back calls; The pay is decent but, moving up is rare and, management picks favorites. So, unless you’re on their good side you’re not going anywhere."
good,Poor management style not everyone on the same page and different departments don't work well together. The people you work with are very helpful but management plays favoritism to much.
good,"I had all the customer service experience and software experience, but needed to be trained on the particular position itself.  The person they assigned to train me didn't know the job either, therefore it was not a good experience."
good,Felt like working at call center. Very fast paced incoming calls. Limited time to 3 to 5 minutes per call. Not well managed. Too much favoritism. Turnover was high.
good,"This is a good company to work for. The hours are reasonable and there is overtime opportunities. Most of the job is documentation and data entry. It's pretty simple if not repetitive and tedious. Doing the math, there really isn't a whole lot of room for advancement. 200+ people in the department and 7 or 8 manager positions. and of those managers, not many of them were looking to leave at any point. So if you don't mind being stuck in the same position year after year, this would be a great place for you."
good,"Many different areas of IT, and it's relatively easy to move between roles when initially starting your career. Not the best place for learning the latest technologies though (but that may depend on the department, but usually most technologies and tools used are not the latest and greatest) ;"
good,"Parking "
good,"Cigna as a whole is a great company to work for. Most of Management is supportive and helpful. The environment in office is positive and bright. Downsides are PTO (based on bidding), ability to move up significantly is harder than advertised, and the job itself is entirely too stressful going from day-to-day. Standards you're to adhere to can be overwhelming, too."
good,It was a good environment. Learned a lot and managers are friendly. If finished my project and had to move in to a different project. I would work for them again in future.
good,Average insurance company.  The employees are dedicated professionals but management did not support the innovative viewpoints of the team.  Creative thinkers were not elevated or recognized for suggestive improvement but rather pealized
good,"Full and busy 8 hour day of reviewing contracts and different health plans, making necessary benefit determinations for medical necessity and authorizations daily, based on regional and regulatory guidelines."
good,"that people are willing to help to if necessary, fast pace of a list needed to be completed within a day, typing is a must. Communication with  people, dictation of  phone conversations"
good,"Not nearly enough work life balance but enjoy the teams I work with. Lots of silos, redundant work because people do not talk to each other. PTO time is lost if it's not taken, which can't always be taken due to no work/life balance."
good,Once I excelled in one area it was hard me to get cross trained in another area. Very slow paced place and if you performed a certain duty well then they kept you there for the most part.
good,"Though they have the best of intentions the management seems unsure of exactly why processes, operating procedures, and systems operate the way they do.  However they are kind, do try to continue training and teaching at every opportunity, and legitimately have an employees best interests at heart."
good,"Building a good rapport with brokers"
good,It was a ok place to work. My direct manager was wonderful. Do not have much to say about upper management. Spent to much  times in meetings that were repetitive of the previous meeting.
good,Cigna is a good place to work. I would recommend employment with them to a friend. The culture is very diverse.There are self training programs available to support self improvement.  There is also remote worker's opportunities.
good,Cigna is a Fortune 500 company with many opportunities for growth and change. They have positions available across the country and internationally.  Many positions are WAH (work at home).
good,"Professional office space, excellent training and a very solid support network. Various avenues to travel for self improvement made available to self motivated people."
good,"A typical day would be processing healthcare benefits, assisting the customers with their healthcare insurance plans. the management was helpful with the training required. the workplace was a call center with the potential to advance. the most most enjoyable part of the job was knowing how to explain the customers Diagnoses & what it meant in comparison to their benefits. The hardest part was when the job was downsized."
good,"The company is good in giving basic information about customer service and health insurance.  There is opportunity for you to move and grow, but also obstacles to hinder the progress onward."
good,Easy to get lost in the multi-layered management structure. Limited governance and accountability.   Hard to move the needle forward due in large part to people claiming their 'turf' and not working collaboratively.
good,"Among managed care companies, Cigna is forward-looking and progressive. Its integrated value proposition is the way the industry is moving. "
good,"Very demanding job because they wanted speed and accuracy, which is hard to do with some of the claims that were processed.  They had a layoff and since I was a fairly new hire, my position was terminated.  Would have continued to strive for the speed in processing claims if I had not been laid off."
good,"While answering phones all day isn't for everyone and if you can handle being on the phone for 8 hours a day, five days a week than Cigna is the place for you.  Your coworkers are more like family and it is a fast paced, constantly changing environment."
good,I did enjoy it and there is some lovely mangers there. I found the people there to be good friends even though I don't work there anymore. I leaned a few skills to help me in the future.
good,"This is a great company with a great culture. I enjoyed my tenure at Cigna HealthSpring. However, change in Executive Leadership radiates throughout the teams. Some change is good and some not so much. My enjoyment of my job left when my Executive Leadership changed."
good,"I was lucky enough to be a part of the HealthSpring staff when it was a smaller unit.  I thought when Cigna came in there would be improvements in processes and in operations. I have not seen this. Many areas are under staffed, departments have a different feel from one segment to another."
good,"Productive and fun workplace, everyone there was a joy to work with, alot of training and learning. Very much a teamwork facility.. enjoyed working there.."
good,"great way to develop analytical and communication skills. Room for advancement, and great manager to provide guidance and career development."
good,"•          Provide phone coverage for inbound member service call center."
good,I worked from 7:30am to 4:30pm Monday thru Friday.I learned a tremendous amount of knowledge from the physicians i worked with over the past 13 yrs in GI.I had wonderful co-workers and up until the last 4 yrs i believe the management was excellent and i worked with allot over the last 29yrs and 8months with Cigna.The most enjoyable part of my job was my everyday interaction with the patients and they did more for me than i did for them.Last year Cigna  had a big lay off and let the whole GI dept in Phx go so everybody has been alot more worried about the Job security..Overall Cigna was a good company to work for and i enjoyed my time with them.
good,Not very employee friendly. The place is always changing i was moved 3 times in 1 month.
good,"Cigna is a good place to work with good benefits but it is very ""matrix"" oriented."
good,"Responsible for ensuring the day to day NOC tasks are prioritized correctly and completed in a timely manner, reviewing quality of work (e.g. tickets accuracy, completion of daily checklist, call monitoring, ticket summaries, and notifications), ensuring processes and procedure are followed, provide 2nd level escalation and technical support, train personnel on operations tasks, assist in resolving any conflicts within the team."
good,Co-workers work well together. The hardest part is working from 7:30-6:00 without a break on many days.
good,Overall it was a nice place to work.  The management department was not so good.  They are micro-managers.
good,"Assisted Cigna Healthcare insurance members with questions or inquiries regarding insurance claims. Provided insurance premium amounts to customers and potential members. Informed customer on the status of paid, unpaid and pending."
good,I was about 18 when I started working there. The pay and  hours were ok. I didn't have to worry about being fired. Quota was very important so we had to take as many calls as possible. We were micromanaged and had supervisors walking up and down the aisle to make sure we were taking calls. It felt like school sometimes. Management was a bit intimidating. Overall it is an OK company to work for Cigna has a lot of programs and benefits for their employees.
good,"Provided billing, claim, benefit, and explanation of benefits information to customers, reviewed claims/benefits and coverage; explained coverage, non-coverage then resolved issues. "
good,"The pay was great, the management was great, the corporate ethics I feel are questionable."
good,A typical day at work was a lot of data entry and transferring and organizing media.The hardest part of the jobs was working a 12 day. Management was okay to me.
good,"cigna is a great company to start making money, however it is very stressful and stagnant"
good,Learnt a lot about the claim processing system. Great work experience.
good,"Good company however, the contentious acquisitions make job security questionable; there have been 4 within the last 5 years."
good,"Great for self motivators and those who don't work well with others. Management was sometimes tricky to get ahold of, but a great desk job where you can focus on your tasks and not be bothered with outside issues."
good,Working at Cigna I learned how to properly communicate with customers and professionals.
good,A great place to work ! Great benefits . Thats starts day 1. However its a very stress career
good,"Cigna is a good company.  some people are very nice. it is ok for salary. "
good,"Salary is good, medical insurance is not ideal; thought it would be better given the company is a major international carrier. Flexible schedule with ample paid time off."
good,Watch what you do.  They will fire you with no warning. Dress is casual. Communication between departments is almost non-existent.  The pay is ok unless you are being promoted.  then they will pay you as little as possible.
good,"Too many turn over with management that didn’t know how to process system that you worked always had to reach out to Tc. "
good,"It's a pretty neat place to work. You really get to learn a lot when you first start with the pharmacy benefit and as time passes with how long you have been there, you get to learn about the medical benefit and other plan types. Management is okay, I felt like sometimes they didn't really care and that you're just a number and that you be replaced easily if you are not performing up to their expectations"
good,"I did not mind working here because the company culture was great. I just did not like the hours I was given, because I worked Friday-Monday. It was four 10 hour shifts."
good,in this role you had to be perfect. it was on the phone customer service and providing benefits to customers everything had to be accurate. the management was very helpful.
good,"Was a good place to work and learned lots about insurance industry, experience was helpful when transitioned to hospital industry and began to analyze billing, coding and reimbursement by payer."
good,"Very well defined goals and responsibilities, though projects were often shifted. Acted in multiple roles on multiple projects. Always working as part of a team so there was a lot of support and collaboration. Management was accessible.  In depth training when new technology or methodology was introduced."
good,Nothing good to say other then being paid well. Company cares nothing to there on employees health needs and is inconsistent with actions by managers. Not to mention nothing but stress
good,Good work environment fast paced culture. A good amount of responsibility is placed on this position with decisions being made daily on how cases should proceed.
good,"I only worked at Cigna in the inbound call center for about 6 months until I had to quit due to anxiety issues. The job is very stressful if you're not used to a call center environment. However, my manager was an awesome individual and tried to help me overcome said anxiety. Unfortunately, due to the type of calls I was getting (so many angry people [mainly due to Flexible Spending Account issues] called), I couldn't put myself through the mental stress any further and had to resign. You get a lot of time in training, but it's unfortunately not enough time to cover EVERYTHING that my arise as an issue. Also, once you're out of training, there's ""chat support"" that's supposed to help you with any issues you can't figure out alone, but it wasn't very helpful (to me, at least) most times. I found myself asking a question that even seasoned employees couldn't answer and had to ask for help (which caused longer wait times for the customer and screwed up your stats). The goal was to be as customer centric as possible to take burden off of the customers, but you're limited in what you can do because you also need to be concerned about your stats. And if you were in a certain ""AUX state"" too long, someone would message you asking why and if you could return to taking calls (that got super annoying). If you leave on good terms and have decent stats, they'll re-hire you without issue. I fall into that category, but I won't be working for them again unless I don't have to be on the phone..."
good,"Position lacked work life balance, it was almost impossible to obtain time off even if you have vacation time available. Look forward to working holidays and weekends if its not a problem, then its a good place to be employed."
good,"Worked at Cigna for multiple years and enjoyed my time their. They are very good at promoting based on merit and achievements. The drawback is the insurance world is in a state of constant change, and two separate company mergers during my time there resulted in the complete replacement of all levels of management I had come to be familiar with, as well as many layoffs in other departments. I myself was often promoted, but my workload as administrative assistant grew to unrealistic proportions as they were unwilling to hire other assistants and instead spread my responsibilities across seven high level directors, along with all levels of management that fell under them."
good,I really enjoyed the people I worked with.  The job included several different systems that you had to log into when before you could begin work.  The training was virtual as well as meetings and talking to your manager.  The hardest part for me was having to meet you productivity daily.
good,Cigna was AMAZING! I've Learned different Technics to draw on patients of all ages. I couldnt have asked for a better Externsite. Everyone was amazing the vibes were Tremendous!
good,Is an organization that is committed to delivering the highest quality of health care to its customers by partnering with providers to close gaps in the areas of diagnosis and treatment.
good,I got to Learn a lot from this job I worked for a Doctor that is a Natural path and everyday I learned a lot  ..plus I did my Phlebotomy skills and Processing  I enjoyed this job
good,Clinical coder /  Properly coding patient charts for billing
good,"Answered multiple calls a day, while doing research and making outbound calls when time permitted. While learning about many accounts, cultural differences, and insurance ins and outs, there were a number of requirements to hit on each call. Automated phone calls and upset or disgruntled callers could make the day challenging, but there was very good management and great coworkers."
good,A typical day at work consisted of processing medical claims for payment.  Management were rarely seen or heard from.  Hardest part of the job was meeting quota for the day depending upon tier of claims being paid.
good,CIgna healthcare is a company to work for. Very flexable and a very secure position.
good,"Call center isn’t a easy job but work environment and schedule are nice. Moved onto group claims and job is much better, but advancement is a bit slow and raises don’t come close to keeping up with cost of living. Wish medical benefits were better. You would think working for insurance company you’d have better benefits. All in all I’m pretty content until something that offers me more comes along"
good,"Overall I enjoyed working at Cigna. I enjoyed having the ability to help customers and resolve their issues. However, management has unrealistic expectations when it comes to going above and beyond to advocate for customers while keeping call time minimal. The pay is great as long as you're not using their health benefits.."
good,great place to start your career. lots of flexibility. plenty of opportunities within the company to choose from. Several offices located globally. great place.
good,Good work life balance. Very friendly staff with flexibility .to work from home and opportunities to move into different roles and relocate to different parts of the country.
good,In early and out late. Troubleshooting network and desktop issue's as well as many other duties.
good,"Collaboration with other health coaches enabled us to give a great deal of information and support to better the health of many individuals"
good,Cigna's goals became misguided. They turned their attention away from the clients and was more focused on some competitive 'who can do it faster' drama which caused the reps to grossly neglect their clients.
good,Very fast-pasted. stressful for a first-time career but it pays very well for the area. The pay was the best part of the job because 13+ an hour in a small town is a lot. The hardest part was telling a customer that something they needed (and was detrimental to their health) was not covered.
good,"Cigna was a great company to work for, despite the mandatory overtime. They offer work from home opportunities - which is an amazing benefit to working for them."
good,"It's a relaxed environment when it comes to the dress code, fairly flexible on schedule. If you show them your dedicated they promote you and allow you to work from your home if you so desire. They offer insurance on the day of hire... at least they did when I worked there. I learned how to encourage people on their job and get maximum performance out of the team I was over."
good,"Cigna was a decent place to work, until, unfortunately, my position was eliminated as part of a mass layoff following the financial crisis of 2008. Reasonable work/life balance, great benefits and most people are great to be around and work with."
good,"Each day is different.  Communicate telephonically with members and Providers to coordinate care.  Assess needs and collaborate with team members, providers and members.  Attend weekly and monthly meetings with Ancillary Team and provide updates and status changes.  Attend CHT Meetings two times a week to discuss member's situation with the team.  Have learned to work with people from diverse backgrounds and positions.  The workplace culture is diverse and team members hold a variety of positions from Medical Director to Net Ops to Customer Service.  Sometimes the hardest part is not being able to service a member's needs immediately.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when a member becomes able to manage their condition(s) effectively and all of their needs are being met."
good,I enjoyed working with my fellow employees. Everyone was kind and always helpful. It was stressful because our quality of how we performed effected our paycheck every quarter. So if we were reviewed and an error was discovered our pay base was automatically reduced.
good,Not Bad for an consulting position. Wished it could have been longer.
good,working for a call center is always very repetitive. I enjoyed working here because I enjoy working with people. it was very easy to get ahead in a career and to earn bonuses. the hardest part would be sitting for long hours.
good,A fun place to wok but a lot of hard work Is required. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
good,"I loved the different experiences with a family practice. At the time the staff was a little on the ""unfocused"" side. Even though their personalities were hard to work with, pt care was number one priority."
good,working with customers to collect information to make a decision on benefits.
good,El trabajo me gusta mucho. Es atención al cliente y todos los dias tienes casos nuevos y nuevos retos que cumplir. Somos un equipo multicultural y la verdad que se aprende mucho de otras culturas. Dos veces por semana la empresa pone a nuestra disposición fruta totalmente gratis. Mis superiores son persona muy competentes nunca te piden nada que ellos mismos no esten dispuestos hacer.

Helping the business partners to recruit and source business through his team. Maintaining good relationship with customers in Service. Every Month twice Conducting meeting and review with Advisers.
good,"Cigna ODS make  HealthCare  work by improving the health care experience for members and the communities by providing access to high quality health care, options for financing health care costs, and information and services to help our members make the best decisions about managing their health.  The data loads from PNO source systems to ODS  is the first phase of Cigna effort of integrating all their source data into a central Information Data Store(IDS).As part of this initiative, an ETL Architecture was developed for migrating data from the sources into the IDS."
good,"It was a nice company, learned a lot with the few months that were given to me before the company had to lay off over 100 employees and physicians. But the experience was well worth it."
good,"Overall, a good place to work. Can be high pressure environment. Healthcare is an ever changing field. The time off is comparable. The company could use a major overhaul in the way of technology. Systems are outdated."
good,"It's a good place to work. Management is supportive. I have a good schedule, and PTO is not a problem. The physical location that I am at has been very difficult to engage customers in Coaching."
good,Opportunity for advancement if you work hard. Supportive management and training. The environment is stressful but the pay beats competitors.
good,The job is very demanding and unfortunately the sales people are allowed to be disrepectful as long as they service the client.
good,Awesome Company. Need to be working in my previous field (Public Relations) Entertainment.
good,The environment is boring and not enough internal connection other than that its a a great environment to just work and go home to pay the bills their are room for growth but it depends on the manger.
good,One month of training which includes assessments that requires 90% or higher for a passing grade. It's almost like taking a course in school. It gets easier after training class is over.
good,"Providing employees with there quality feedback .Coaching and providing career guidance.

good,Cigna is a good company to work for esp. since they have worked with my hours for my part time schedule.
good,"You are well trained and have plenty of support after training. It's a high stress job but you have to look at the bright side. You're paid well, benefits are great and your PTO is nice to have as well."
good,Enjoyed working with my coworkers learning valuable information to assist with customers on a daily basis. The job was very structured and detailed.
good,"Eight hours a day.  Overall improvement of grammar, punctuation, and spelling.  Management was good.  Worked with a very hard-to-get-along-with co-worker.  No real hard part about job.  Love working with words."
good,"Hypocritical work life balance - poor management, not all departments. I have previously been very fortunate to have great management that assists with career development BUT company ethics are not consistent depends on the individual"
good,I enjoyed the environment at Cigna though my Supervisor did not communicate well. There were tons of temp workers that had been there many years so Cigna could get out of benefits for staff and they let people go after 6 month contracts were up instead of renewing contract
good,"Typically I would unlock all drawers, organize and file case management work load, create letters, track files, calendaring and setting up meetings for case management as well as delivering needed invoice records and any other misc request that came through email"
good,I began my career in the marketing communications department and through reorganizations ended my career in Nashville as the director of Office Services.
good,"cliche company if your not in, you wont advance , they set you up not to pay increases, they work you like a dog and no advancement. Scheduling sucks if not in the cliche."
good,"Many days began with a meeting, the rest of the day was driven by production. Highly competitive and productive environment. I learned a lot about the processes and strategies used to make the warehouse an efficient home delivery pharmacy."
good,"After initial training for healthcare laws, regulations and operation of systems, rep do not really receive much additional training. "
good,"Alright company to work for, managers know what they are teaching and doing . Just alot of guidelines and quotas to follow or else you will be terminated"
good,I love working at Cigna until they hired a manager from the outside and he wouldn't allow you to make up time although other employees were able to. I lost my job for being 4 minutes late and not being allowed to make up. Others had worse attendance issues were allowed to make up and then allowed to work from home. Other managers just let him do what he wanted and didn't lift a finger to help. Run away from this company;
good,"Benefits are great! Management in California need to update policies as well as office. Communication needtoped, update averagehandling time to each staff member, stop playing favorites."
good,"Cigna are very big on trying to keep employees happy and their work life balance.  This is not necessarily displayed by paying [especially lower banded] employees a fair salary for a fair days' work though."
good,Flexible schedule and market level pay. Lack of career advancement and promoting within the company. Frequent changes to workflow and responsibilities.
good,Constant changing environment. Must be able to learn on the fly and embrace changes. Good peer to peer relationship building is a must. Working with several systems and computer programs.
good,"Cigna TTK working culture is very good to work, Employee friendly. Best health insurance in the insurance industry, regarding product features, customer benefits."
good,The best part of this job is the ability to work from home. The hardest part of this job is working is the inability to post out to another position during certain seasons of the job.
good,"great product and system"
good,My Internship was a  life changing experience. This was a good company to work for.
good,"I was a dedicated Records Release Tech and I enjoyed my job. I spoke with clients, other medical centers, providers, labs, on a daily basis. I enjoyed having to solve issues that would come up during a normal day. My co-workers were fun to be around as were the departments I worked with."
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was being able to network with other employees.
good,"Nice place to work. Pleasant associates. A majority of management tends to show favoritism though. When you're not apart of  ""the clique"", there tends to be backlash sometimes."
good,"Training- needs to be better, more one on one  training."
good,My training for this position was very good we had good trainersthat had been with the company for a number of years. The trainers were very patient and open minded.
good,"Typical Day at Work is Hectic but there is huge opportunity to learn"
good,"typical day is answer phones, greeting customer with questions regarding there denied claims. Research claim and discuss with customer is anything was left out or billed incorrectly."
good,Proactive project and nice location. Limited room for growth which was less than motivating. Micro managing in the most self defeating  way.
good,"Very fast paced. A lot of work and very little resources. Difficult to maintain work-life balance. Develop, coach and mentor direct reports. Provide monthly feedback on one on one's. Overall a good but stressful position."
good,"its a call center! what would think? my virtuoso wasnt tolerated... take easy and keep flicking the wrist, soon you'll hook"
good,"Started at 5:00 AM (flex-time schedule), went to mail drawers to retrieve daily claims for processing.  The claim quotas were a minimum of 300/day, and no errors.  On a monthly basis, you would be given warnings and your job was in jeopardy if you could not maintain them."
good,I was very satisfied with the work life balance. The benefits were fair and the compensation was average.  The big drawback was with the new ACA that was passed by Congress made job security very poor.
good,"Processed medical claims"
good,"Cigna is a good company to work for. T Shirt and jeans except on customer days. They are very into helping the community and donating to several organizations like March of Dimes and United Way. "
good,"I say that the environment is professional for the most part because I brought the professional in, when I became employed there. I basically stayed to myself for the exception of a few individuals. I had a cubicle overlooking a lake, so it really kept me serene. I will say they were very understanding when I could not come to work for a few days during a family emergency. There were a couple of situations that turned me off about the company. One instance in particular was when I overheard the supervisor and two to three leads talking about some of the employees in a negative manner. I found that to be appauling and very unprofessional."
good,Productive
good,The supervisor I had loved to belittle the nurses working for her.  We were having a question/answer session that day and I was called on to ask my questions and instead of answering it she totally ignored and just talked over me as if I had said nothing.
good,I liked the work at Tel-Drug and miss the people that I worked with.  I did a lot of sitting which is hard 40 or more hours a week.  They had mandatory overtime a lot and you were penalized (raise wise) if you did not participate.  I did get lunches and breaks which was good.
good,"Great environment , management try their best but have hard time keeping or returning questions. There is no room for growth and pay is on the lesser side for the experience I have."
good,"Good place to work. Beautiful campus. Nice staff.  Excellent location.  Safe conditions. Most enjoyable part of job was interaction with staff,  owners and clients. ."
good,"My department was eliminated due to automation."
good,"Typically arrive before 9, enjoy a daily quiz before work starts. often have several meetings book to discuss the current projects, try and fit in as much work around those. Take a half hour lunch leave at 5 if I am lucky."
good,"Some great things about Cigna, great vacation time, great for learning and improving skills, but company lays off a lot in the last 2 years."
good,"A typical day at work is very productive busy an tentative due to thing/processes always changing."
good,"The Part D appeals department is full of drama. Besides that really easy and redundant. The department was still developing. The turnover ratio is high. Great benefits! Not easy to climb the ladder. Minus the drama great company. Primary focus is on responding to inquiries specifically related to medications (i.e.: process and/or approve request for Prior Authorization or member reimbursements, assist pharmacies on adjudicating claims over the phone, answer formulary questions regarding therapeutic alternatives, etc.)."
good,"They pay commissions only to the agents. no base, no benefits."
good,I've enjoyed my time at Cigna and would recommend working there. The company as a whole is a good company to work for.
good,Good people but many layers of management and a multitude of teams that you must get buy in before anything moves forward. Work life and days off are comparible to other large companies.
good,Most of the staff were very friendly but some were not very kind for no reason at all. I felt discriminated against and bullied so I quit. If you can handle discrimination than it may work great for you.
good,"I really love working for this company, just not the department I am in. I have been full time since 2015, but have no advancement despite glowing review from managers, supervisors and co-workers."
good,Cigna used to be a nice place but after a while they started laying off people on the lower end and sending work offshore. From there the culture on the lower end of the totem pole was terrible and we were treated like numbers instead of people. Constant fighting with management to help us when instead they would be too busy to work on the “growth” aspect of our culture. Employees are incentivized to error people on their own team instead of brining Small mistakes to their attention.
good,Upper management needs training and additional development. Thss would make the work culture and home/work balance better. Aside from the above I really enjoyed my years with the company.
good,"The company's culture was great until it was acquired by Cigna. Afterwhich, it became prejudice towards a person's Race, Education, etc. If you weren't a white male, college educated or connected to such, you were laid off. Regardless the number of years you did your job with great reviews/evaluations."
good,I'd rate Cigna pretty high purely based on the pay scale. I think the upper management team are very competent. The company is running very lean on a daily basis so multi-tasking and ever approaching deadlines is the normal.
good,"Decent company to start a career. Benefits are great, team is great. Company is all for themselves though and not their employees. Days go by fast and are busy. Typical day depends on what you do, but everyone there is busy."
good,"This job was a customer services high demanding on the phone rep  utilizing  multi screen resources for Cigna insurance. Adjustments to claims, appeal request, policy guidelines and benefit explanation rep."
good,"It has been a few years since I worked there, so I do not know what the current culture or work situation is like.  When I left, I simply needed a break from the industry for a while."
good,Depending on the department you could work weekends and stay as late as Midnight. Not very understanding of family or personal health issues. Receive points for absences no matter what the cause.
good,"In this position, I was part of a group that provided coaching patients to meet their metrics for patient health growth.  "
good,"Overall Decent place to work, lack of upward movement, lots of change, and subpar management. Lower on the payscale for the industry averages, grateful for the opportunity though"
good,The work at Cigna is very important and greatly benefits our customers but the leadership and management leaves a lot to be desired in terms of understanding how to engage employees and treating them fairly.
good,I enjoy working for Cigna. I think its a great company to work for.The pay is ok but not as competitive as some places.  My coworkers are great and my direct manager is concerned about us. My only concern is room for advancement for some people.
good,Working in Cignal Tv gives me more challenge but fun sometimesbecause of my co workers . Its more entertaining when it comes in entertaining costumer .But sometimes it quiet difficult because of the subs who have problem .
good,Everyday it's something new. We stay extremely busy. Too busy some days. I've been given the opportunity to be in a supervisor role. Very appreciative of it.
good,"Great place to work, had the opportunity to work from home which was awesome!  Management disapproves of trying to move up. Retaliation for transferring to another department...sad"
good,Its very hectic.14 hrs minimum working hours. I learned the etl testing process. Poor management.Co workers are helpful.
good,Worked long hours for way too many people (5 Directors and a Sr. Director) and their subordinates.  Job was very diversified.
good,"A typical day at the call center was coming in, log on to your headset. Once your shift begins the call come through the headset and your day begins. It was basically the same call formation, but a different individual. I learned a good bit about insurance guidelines and policies. We informed the policy holders of their benefits, what their coverage was and how much their out of pocket expenses would be if any."
good,"*Ensures customer data is entered accurately and timely"
good,I enjoy how to assist with the callers with their authorization questions or concerns. Like most jobs-more tune in with development and advancement with their current staff.
good,"Cigna taught me to learn all aspects of everybody's job. It makes you more versatile and marketable. My coworkers were like a second family to me, very caring people. A typical day would be repetitive work unless you're pulled from your department to help elsewhere. The hardest thing was to adjust to the many changes of the rules to the job and remembering them all to avoid making mistakes. I enjoyed the flexibility, wellness center and benefits that came along with my new found family."
good,"Managed the processing of the medical records requests, coordinated follow-ups, updated files, negotiated with providers, processed payments, trained new employees, and worked with a team of ten co-workers"
good,Great place to work. It takes a long time to become perm. So if you get the chance hang in there as long as you can. Managemant is nice and does its best to keep you from stressing out.
good,High stress jobs and need to be able to multitask. They expect high volume production along with a high quality results.Was able to work from home through office provided computer. Enjoyed the daily challenges the job offers as well as being able to utilize my detail orientated skills by reviewing others work. There is not much room for advancement unless you are highly driven and more dedicated to company than you home life balances.
good,Typical days are long but productive. I learned a lot about medications during my time with the company. I had just as many bad managers as I had good ones. I had good hours and it was a short drive to work from where I lived at the time.
good,Awesome salary for med assistant..not so much health fair events..i dont like that i get my paycheck once a month..
good,"Cigna has a business-casual atmosphere. Pretty laid back, as long as you get your work done you are good. Sometimes with a company this large it can be hard to get changes implemented/red tape at times."
good,Cigna is a old name with a quality stamp.  The staff at the Tempe location really go out thier way to help the patients.  The front desk associates  never get the recognition they deserve.   If it werent for them half of the prescription request would never be filled.  The back office always get recognized but show some love to the front be ause they are ghe real go getters!
good,"I have worked there 4x as a temp. Each time at a different position."
good,Cigna is one of the best company to work for because the company have there own University on  line for courses that would be helpful to employees achieve and learn the job there are interested in. Cigna  give their employees opportunity to grow in organization.
good,The job can be good as it’s very easy. But the management is very poor. They choose their favorites and only promote those people. They do offer work at home which is nice
good,"Ok benefits, good people to work for. Could use better training and communication. Definitely company need come first - hard to balance life and work."
good,"Cigna was a fine place to work.  Unfortunately, due to a decline in contracts and lack of work we were laid off.  Good healthcare benefits and matching 401K.   There was also an onsite gym and company encouragement for healthy living (free flu shots, healthy eating seminars).  Vacation time off allowance was also very good."
good,"Working for Cigna is a great experience, if you consider simply doing the work. Ita the micromanagement of the managers that make the job unbearable. ."
good,"I have to say I truly enjoyed working there. People were excellent they were highly skilled, good, kind-hearted people. Although  it's a great job this isn't the place for a young scrub tech to go to expand their skill set . they offer a limited variety Outpatient Surgical procedures."
good,very good place to work but since it has sensitive data we need to have all the required permissions before installing any software. They use all good techologies
good,Great company to work for with great benefits.Management and team is very supportive and great opportunity for career development and growth. I would highly recommend this company to others
good,"Good company, competitive benefits. Fast-paced, and could be stressful. "
good,"Good challenging work that requires learning new skills."
good,"The people were great and the work was doable, challenging at times but not super stressful.  The pay was not great and there was no job security. It was a great place to enter the professional work field."
good,Hours are terrible and dont offer 40 hrs a week. They place you in bad locations. GM and Owner are disrespectful. Not allowed to use the heater. Often left working alone.
good,In-house desk-top publishing and on-line programming to create camera-ready PDF’s necessary for Cigna’s Printed Directories for distribution or print on demand usage for Medical and Dental directories.
good,"As a Short Term Disability Claim Manager, it was crucial to have a very distinct work type personality. Skills in multitasking, focus, attention to detail, customer service and adaptability are essential. The job required very specific goals met while maintaing quality customer contact."
good,"I really enjoyed working here. I had a lot of opportunities and loved all the roles I did. Benefits were really good. I only left due to change in career. I know things have changed since, but I would definitely work at Cigna again."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, pero sueldos bajos para el volumen de trabajo, no se tienen en cuenta cuantos idiomas hables."
good,"I enjoyed my time here but insurance isn't for me anymore. The training was good but the turnover that it goes thru with management did cause some confusion. For the most part, its a good company."
good,"i was on a temporary contract which expired, I had hoped to secure a full time position."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Cigna but there were a few things that were/can be frustrating. When I was hired I was told there would be room for growth and moving up. That wasn't the case towards the end. I was told I would work 40 hrs/week but towards the end they cut my hours and had no intention to give me back my 40 hrs/week which made it very hard to survive on. My manager said I could come and go whenever I wanted as long as I put in 40 hours per week and then went back on her word and put me on a strict schedule due to a coworker micromanaging and complaining it was hard for her to do her work because I wasn't there when she needed me to be (she was my coworker, not my boss). My boss was never around but I liked that because I could just sit down and do my job. The job itself was fun and fairly easy if you applied yourself. Most of my coworkers were very kind and outgoing. Overall it was a pleasant time to work there. Life jus had other ideas so me so I left. I would recommend this job, just try to keep your head down and focus on your work and everything will be fine."
good,"one of my favorite companies full of opportunity and very good people to work with Great people at all levels of the company - joining is like joining a family and everyone is supportive of each other and has a great time together"
good,"busy call center, 8 hours with occasional mandatory ot, difficult to handle unhappy or irate customers, extremely micro managed, good pay and raises yearly"
good,"Again, > 23yrs ago. No memory of managers, salary, perks.atmosphere was pleasant, helpful coworkers, close to home, free parking. lenient work hours if appointment time needed."
good,"nice place to work."
good,it was hard to walk through the front door knowing your coworkers would not make eye contact smile or say hello I think this was the most unfriendly workplace I had ever been in
good,"The work environment is very productive and quick paced. Though had to work for little more hours per day , it is good for learning new technologies and as well for professional enhancement."
good,"It is a good place to work if you are looking for something kind of slower paced with good benefits and great flexibility.  There are a lot of opportunities to move around the company and many WAH positions so if that is what you are looking for it is good. Wages are probably below average per positions, but this is made up in flexibility."
good,Management did not always have answers. Learned CPT4 coding and ICD9 coding. Laid back workplace atmosphere. Hardest part of job was denying claims for people that deserved the benefit.  Easy was getting help from co-workers.
good,There is a lot of room for growth at Cigna. The downside to working at Cigna was they outsourced a lot of the jobs to places overseas. The upside to working at Cigna I was able to work from home.
good,The training is not long enough. You are thrown on the floor after 4 weeks. You and the fellow trainees have 2 or 3 coaches who have a hard time keeping up with everyone. You get a ton of work and it is nothing like the training. You are kind of on your own. Everyone is nice there but you are not set up for success.
good,I worked for Cigna for 8 years and I loved my job although political I gave it my all. The patient aspect of things I missed but achieved later in life.
good,"I really enjoy working at Cigna and will be sad to see my contract end. I started 9/6/17 and will end 12/31/17. My training manager is trying to help me find a perm position within the company but it is proving difficult, not because of my performance but because of the jobs currently available."
good,This is an temp job and for the time that I've been working here its an enjoyable job one i don't mind coming to each day and that i would like to take on full time if possible.
good,Enjoyed the culture of the company and fun place to work. Executives were helpful and always sharing insight about what to do on the job. There were celebrations for jobs well done.
good,Deadlines very flexible.  Manager very understanding about needs for personal time off.  Teams were virtual and meetings are done via phone and Skype.
good,"Worked there 22 years ago, not sure that past experience would be relevant currently. It was OK working there, no big positives or negatives. Left due to job elimination."
good,"Review apps to determine what they are and where to route them properly. Very easy laid back environment and love to  listen to music while working, makes the day go by much faster."
good,"Great culture, fast paced environment. End users are very friendly and understanding.  Schedules are pretty flexible and co-workers are knowledgeable."
good,"Your outlook on this company depends strictly on upper management.  If you report to good people, its a great company, if not, the experience may not be a good one."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Cigna working for the Employee Benefits Division on Cigna Health Plan systems. During my time there, however, there were a few mergers with and acquisitions of other health plans, which created a lot of anxiety, since each restructuring involved layoffs due to redundancies."
good,"I joined Cigna TTK as a Health service associate, my job was to handle queries and inquires about insurance policy and to assist our clients over the phone."
good,Was only there 3 weeks for an internship. Seemed like a good company and other employees talked highly of it. I only have limited time and experience there so I cant say too much about it.
good,"I was used as a contractor and so sometimes got the grubbby work. However, I was still able to documents in their format and describe more clearly what was required. When I left my manager took me to HER manager and said this contractor is the first one to get anything done,"
good,My experience was unique in that I was not part of the core business. Management was responsive and easy to work with. Benefits and salary were excellent.
good,"Company does not keep people around for long only when work is available, once open enrollment is over they get rid of half the staff with no notice.."
good,"The managers emanate an atmosphere that they believe most employees are not trustworthy and look for ways to avoid doing their work. Micromanagement that accomplishes nothing and contributes to wasted time. Most frustrating was having to redo other peoples' work when it was obvious they did not even try to follow standard operating procedures, and the lack of accountability and lack of re-educating employees who participated in this behavior"
good,A temp to hire position with no real hiring of qualified people. Had my licensure in Medical Coding and still not hired to review Medicare Part B claims submitted by Physicians and/or Billers.
good,"Began career as Nurse Case Manager for Short Term Disability ; promoted to Sr. Nurse Case Manager for Long Term Disability within 6 months."
good,On a normal work day the overall work atmosphere was positive and full of energy. I usually knew what I had to get accomplished daily when I walked in the door and sat at my desk. My work schedule was set each and every day. I would be busy from the time I logged in until I logged off at the end of the day. My trainer was the best person. She never minded all my many questions.
good,At Cigna I took part in many different rolls and responsibilities. Each gave me the knowledge I needed to further my career. I was able to take part in different training and interim positions for experience.
good,"The organization is great for the consumer, unfortunately the work moral and support is horrible.  Everyone seems to be only for themselves and the lack of team work is evident throughout the different departments."
good,"Cigna is a company with a diverse workforce. The workload was enough for two people, the influx and outflux of individuals is high, there is no room for advancement."
good,CIGNA was a great company to work for.  There benefits were awesome at the time.  It was great to work across from Bushnell Park.  Everyday there was something fun going on at lunchtime.
good,Great balance between work and home life. Lots of ways to be involved in activities through the company.  Always focused on the employees health needs.
good,"Fast Paced, full workloads, listens to employee recommendations and ideas then implements the best, potential for personal professional growth, values highly skilled employees, ability to flex to some degree to retain top employees at a higher rate than many other companies are able to provide."
good,I had a pleasant experience working for Cigna Healthcare.  I had the opportunity to work well with others and work well with little to no supervision
good,Good place to work. Good place to have an opportunity to advance. Good trainers teach you their way of doing things in a 3 month time period.
good,"Thoroughly enjoyed my daily work.  As a risk manager it was never the same and fascinating as I worked with almost all of the corporate departments.  I was provided opportunities to use my discretion to resolve claims working with our legal department I also had opportunities to reach out to plaintiffs.  "
good,"Professional team members, strong work ethics and motivated staff, love to work on my projects, no such pressure , enjoy working with fun loving staff."
good,I worked with a team of fellow classmates within my graduate business program. I learned a bit about marketing and improved my formal presentation skills with the final presentation we did as a team for in front of some CIGNA executives.
good,Overall this was a decent place to work. Nice PTO package. Benefits were not the greatest but doable and the Management was aweful. They did not offer much training so there was lack of knowledge. Very frustrating to deal with managers who depend on their team to do their job because they don't know how.
good,But that was 12 years ago! I would hope the same people-oriented philosophies are in place. Managers truly cared about developing their employees and realized that their employees' successes and failures were a reflection of their management abilities.
good,"I loved being able to work on my own although we were considered a team effort.  I learned alot about the medical and healthcare field as it relates to diagnosis, prognosis, and care."
good,"I feel like my work here is always recognized - never overlooked. The atmosphere at Cigna is one of cooperation and support, which I think is rare in today’s workplace. While many of my friends are searching for new “more satisfying” jobs, I know am very fortunate to be just 25, have had the privilege of being promoted to the lead of my department since I’ve started, and working for a company that I know I will stay with for years. Cigna is truly a great place to work."
good,"dont have any negetive points to mention , but could have given more flexibility and freedom of speach to talk and improve the existing process"
good,"i started at a very low pay, but i didn't complain i reach my goal to a position that i wanted to be.too much pressure on pharmacist part,u can relieved everyone doing all the cashiering and selling yet when it comes to your part they cant help you."

good,"I was an at home, third shift customer service representative who provided excellent customer service via in and outbound calls to expatriates and health care professionals abroad.  My work day involved varied tasks: addressing health care coverage and claim inquiries, executing documents for health care personnel which certified the customer's medical insurance status, etc. The working atmosphere was a team paradigm.  I enjoyed most aspects of my job: I was known and lauded for going the extra mile.  The hardest part of the job was satisfying company telephone answering time matrices, while, at the same time, achieving the company's stated ""one call, one resolution"" goals.  Also, there were periodic errors in the computer application which measured and monitored telephone calls."
good,"On a day to day basis, Cigna keeps you busy which helps the day go by fast. Everyday you get assigned new task to review for employee's to see if they are eligible for FMLA or ADA. After receiving paperwork that is mail out to the employee, it is my responsibility to review and determine whether it's approvable or not. This all takes place while you are answering calls."
good,I would say that Cigna has the most talented people. Fun and friendly and most importantly talented. Most days are about 14 hours long and 6 days a week. People are dedicated which Cigna loves.
good,The company itself is for the workers it is management that is not

Independently responds to inquiries, grievances, complaints or appeals ranging from routine to moderate complexity. May seek assistance with complex customer services issues."
good,"The first thing I do in the morning is check my email, then prioritize my tasks for the day. I've learned so much about the importance of doing my job in a way that satisfies the customer as well as having an impact on the lives of the people we're helping. I work closely with management and co-workers to make sure we're doing everything possible to meet production and quality standards. The hardest part of the job is not being able to meet our departmental metrics. The most enjoyable part of the job is being recognized for a job well done."
good,I have worked at Cigna for 4.5 years doing medical necessity reviews for behavioral health.  I have learned a lot and feel my experience at Cigna makes me a better clinician.

The hardest part of my job was trynng to talk to the customer and tell them what could benefit them about the product in prder for them to want to purchase the cover that Cigna could supply. I had to follow certain procedures in which I had to adhere by in order to treat the customer fairl so that they were able to make an informed decision without me being influencial."
good,I have made some life time friends in this company. I am still friends to this day.

My bosses were fair, but when they felt pressure as you would expect we felt pressure. Awesome otherwise."

I learned to listen to customers and deal with they're problems in a very personal way. I worked well with management on every task. the hardest part about working for any job is dealing with dissatisfied customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was just was the relationship between coworkers and knowing the ins and outs of my job, every detail and being excellent at my job"
good,Working here it is a very professional environment .
good,"I do enjoy my job in the customer service center. This company is very by-the-book. Breaks and lunches are always given in full and on time. Paid vacations, 401k and medical/dental/vision benefits are offered. The health benefits premiums for their employees are very high for their employees and benefits are not that great."
good,Thoroughly enjoyed working in this type of business environment. I was intuned to the needs of the organization and management in providing workplace environments meeting the various functions and types of business services provided to the customer.
good,Cigna has been a very great place to work. It's the type of place that if you are getting your work done no one will bother you. The worse about the job is the workload; it is never ending.
good,Working 12 hours per day. Worked with lot of mutli culter people. Managing onshore and offshore team(India).
good,"very hands on and multi-tasked work environment, goo company overall"
good,Pros:
good,The job is a great place to work at. The situation I encountered is that they are more focused on business need then on there employees. Cigna would be great if they could balance out production and assiting their employee's when they may have a family emergency!
good,I don't recall too many events with this company since it was a long time ago.
good,"I processed dental claims, working on a production model, 8 hours a day. I learned how to work in an extremely fast-paced environment, servicing customers, with minimal error. I enjoyed working with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was sometimes running out of claims to process. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my peers."
good,"HealhSpring was a good work environment as a Managed Care Organization. It has recently been taken over by Cigna. It has both a Commercial Product which means it serves a local population and a Medicare product which serves all the states they cover. Their previous population covered TN, AL, TX, and IL, with a purchase in 2008 of an existing FL facility. They were branching into a special care clinic modality where time was spent with patients to allow for more doctor/patients. Each department in the Nashville region was specifically catering to either the administrative, the care, or the morphology of the patients."

good,Per diem health coach positions. Great if you're interested in traveling. The staff was always fun to work with and the employees of the companies were eager to learn about their health.
good,Good company to work with but no good scope of career advancement. Management at middle level needs to be more improved for better guidance to lower level.
good,Cigna was a great company to work for and I felt they had great benefits and lots of opportunities for growth. Change was always on the horizon and that suited my needs! I worked with many great people and have made great friends at Cigna!
good,"Backup and Recovery, Performance Tuning and Migration every day"
good,"flexibility. Modern days requires to have time during the week to do certain things and Cigna has a flexible time schedule, of course some departments are more restricted due to client services"
good,Claims were a little challenging at times and also the amount of claims that were given to one claims manager.Claims Manager was responsible for every part of the claim and some claims required more time than other which could be a damper on getting other tasks done for the day.
good,Great pay and a lot of time off. Management is off and on depending on who your manager is but they are willing to work with you if you feel you would perform better under a different supervisor.
good,"If I were a permanent worker and pay rate was better, this would be the place for a great career. However, it's just a pit stop to my search for longevity."
good,It was a great experience to work from home whilst using my pharmacy degree. I did miss the face to face interaction associated with retail pharmacy. It was my pleasure to work for Cigna.
good,"CIGNA was a great place to work, I especially loved the office location in Clayton. Being in sales was challenging, but rewarding and I enjoyed working there."
good,Great place to start a career. Offers a lot of entry level positions. Opportunities to advance within starting department or within company as a whole.
good,A great place to work.  Many positive changes have taken place in recent years There is room for improvement in compensation -especially how bonuses are awarded.
good,"great people to be around good for extra income but hours in fluctuated but the management was very poor and i felt as if i did my time there long enough,"
good,"Many are hired in for an evening shift. It is difficult, depending on the area and the boss that you have to get a shift change. There are some departments hired in for work at home positions while other departments employees have been there for years and are told that no one is allowed to work from home anymore. So, there is a lot of inconsistency. Tenure seems to get you nothing. Case managers are micromanaged. "
good,"Interesting place to work. There are great people working for the company but each line of business is very isolated, and it is difficult, if not impossible to advance outside of your current line of business."
good,"Cigna is an amazing place to work in regards to the relaxed culture and opportunities presented. Management is willing to allow employees to explore projects that employees desire to work on. Upper management is extremely transparent. Work is busy during certain months, however, team members are willing to work together to help."
good,"I like Cigna-HealthSpring.  The environment is stressful, busy and laid back all wrapped in one.  There are NO micro managers here and everyone is treated like an adult."
good,My last role as a Sr. business Analyst was that of an individual contributor in our new corporate warehouse.  The environment was very fast paced and the analyst/testing was extensive and tediuos.
good,"Cigna hires contractors for different positions, I think Cigna is a great company however the New contracting company I worked for under the cigna account not so good. Im not sure how to answer this question fairly since I was not directly employed by Cigna."

good,"I have been working at Cigna (More than a year)"
good,"I enjoyed my time as a consultant with Cigna.  My project teams were comprised of bright, knowledgable resources who collaborated well together.  I would recommend this company to others."
good,A typical day at the office would be working efficiently in a harmoniuus  work atmosphere. Considering we are all the together for same purpose away from our families I like to try to make the day as positive as it can possibly be. Working together and learning from each other can be fun if we all try!
good,In my time in Cigna I feel like the management was more ready to place blame than to actually learning the process of how the job is done. The most hardest part of my day is having to try to solve problems without any help from leadership.
good,"It's an ok job. I enjoy helping the customers with their issues. Some customers were never satified but that's what makes the job more interesting. This job taught me that everyone, no matter how hard you try will not be satisfied."
good,"CIGNA is a good place to work and they allow you to work from home after six months. Moving up can be difficult if your metrics arent good, but overall it's a good place."
good,"I am done my job with 100% productive mind, always my priority to do best of my side. And I want to secure my future and achive more then i have . my plus point  my hard work and dedication all these goted from my sportsmanship"
good,Cigna is a great place to get started in the insurance industry. The tools they provide and the training is wonderful for setting up a long term carrier in the health insurance industry.
good,"Overall, I had many experiences interning at Cigna. Each day brought a different series of events ranging from very quite to fast paced. The staff was very helpful in their own individual capacity. I learned how to perform and administer a number of protocols and fitness tests necessary to daily job tasks. I will say that some of the challenges I faced during my time at Cigna were my creativity in assisting with the promotion of Health and Fitness events and leading group fitness classes. In contrast, the most rewarding part of the internship was the opportunity and interacting with the other employees of the company."
good,I worked at Cigna for 6 years from 1989 to 1995. It was a good company to work for at the time. Very innovative company for its time and I enjoyed the company I worked for. I was looking for more advancement so I ended my tenure there and went to MassMutual.
good,I enjoy what I do but I do not agree with some of the management. It has came to the point where I do not enjoy waking up in the morning. Managers will talk bad about their employees to other employees which causes trust issues.
good,customer services taking inbound calls in regards to if members had an issue with their plans or needed information such as dental vision changing their pcp or claim information.
good,"My role with this company was a temporary position. Although the initial training needs major restructuring, I would have loved the opportunity to become permanent. This position offered flexibility and is highly performance driven."
good,"Strong company and financially strong. Dedicated to the appropriate investigation, assessment and resolution of claims to the satisfaction of the customer within the confines of the insurance contract."
good,Must be able to adapt to constantly changing metrics and job operating procedures. Employees are great and work hard as a team to meet goals. Cigna has great self training courses and promotes continual learning and development.
good,"Management is okay to work for however I feel that sometimes they don't have your back when you need them to, but I go and do what I need to and strive to make sure that the customer is taken care of."
good,"Very busy demanding call center. Use various systems and a lot of problem solving. Management is numbers orientated vs Customer satisfaction. Coworkers are very enjoyable to work with if you get the time to get to know them. Hardest part of the job is advising someone that what they want will not happen. The most enjoyable part is every call is different and you get to know callers after a period of time, developing a relationship with them."
good,"Day to day functions included processing pharmacy authorization , it was a busy fast paced team environment that i enjoyed working within ."
good,"good people, good pay and benefits."
good,Good company to work for.  Plenty of training classes offered and opportunity for growth.  Allowed for job work/life balance.
good,Its call center work so theres that. Everything is micromanaged. You can work at home but its hard to move up in the company if you do that. Benefits are ok
good,"Cigna is a great company that provides great opportunities for potential employees.The growth process is immediate, and this company will put your skills to use right away."
good,"Many opportunities for career.  Woked as Vault Teller, Profit Analyst, Auditor and AVP in Productivity Services.  Had many associates who have become life long friends."
good,"Nice job to work at. Nice work/life balance, good benefit. Won Houston best places to work award for a couple of years before I was laid off."
good,Cigna is a great company to work for. Management is Great and they are some proving leaders. There are a lot of opportunites to Advance within the company.
good,Good Place to work. Hectic work life balance. Challenging timelines. Management is good. Friendly co workers.Ready to help and support. Just that the work is more.
good,"As with obtaining any job, your advancement here is dependent upon your networking skills and ""who you know"". Overall a good company with competitive pay."
good,I was a Customer service rep. who answered inbound calls from customers who wanted to make changes or give in network benefits information
good,"Learned all the intricacies of the health claims operations industry. Worked with a wonderful group of co-workers. Very fast-paced with deadline constraints which could make your job stressful at times."
good,I was employed with CIGNA for 4years and I was layed off. I started out as an admin assistant and move up to a Tier I claims processor.
good,A typical day at work consists of being accountable. We are screened on everything that we do. The biggest thing that i have learned in my 14 years is how to multitask efficiently. I get along with my coworkers and they all like and respect me. The hardest part of my job is finding the balance between production and quality. I have managed to do so and exceed most of the time. The most enjoyable part of my job is realizing what an important role I play in our clients lives. I try to put myself in their shoes
good,daily working on the telephone to discuss medical insurance cover and give nursing advice to clients.   Hardest part of the job was the location.
good,My duties here involved processing health insurance claims and billing for insurance
good,"My day was as follow. I came into work signed on to take calls from providers that wanted to check medical claim status. Made callbacks to providers who needed a update on claims sent back to be reprocessed. I learned to manage my handle time better."
good,Cigna Behavioral Health is an interesting place to work. The world of health insurance is notoriously complex and the position of Care Senior Associate is not for the shy and incurious. The position requires a very intricate knowledge of behavioral health insurance and the ability to answer callers' questions about healthcare for mental health and substance use concerns.
good,Grateful to be given the opportunity to learn this type of medical coding.  It has been challenging but also rewarding.
good,Was contracted by CIGNA on two occasions. I had the opportunity to work with very knowledgeable coworkers. I learned many new skills while employed there.
good,"Fast paced environment, with many goal orientated tasks, multi-tasking projects and individual contribution along with team work."
good,"Start of the day finding prospective costumer, start calling to those interested to have the satellite cable. I've learned to be patient while talking to the costumer and convincing them to buy my products. the management is good also we have good camaraderie of my fellow workers. the hardest part of my jobs if the costumers house is at the mountain we have to go there and to install the satellite cable even its to far but still enjoying specially when we give the costumers satisfaction."
good,"This is a rapidly growing company, changing at a fast pace. HealthSpring/Cigna is a great place to gain experience and to learn; however, advancement opportunities are limited."
good,Consist of taking 60-80 calls per day solving and investigating customer issues.
good,"Loved working with this company for almost 8 years, then was laid off like many others were due to ""obamacare"". Is a great place to work but they do not offer nor have job security at all."
good,"Department outsourced. Until then, a busy department committed to excellence."
good,A detailed oriented workplace with a friendly atmosphere. Must have detailed knowledge of the healthcare industry. Some employees are really helpful.
good,"Well a typical day of workat cigna would consist of, clocking in, taking calls helping customers with their needs, having 2 breaks and a lunch. I learned alot at Cigna, like the hot eys, more experience on microsoft excel and other various programs."
good,"I liked my time here. There are good people who do a great job and care about what they do, there are also bad people who happen to be in management who do not have the same dedication resulting in a situation of ""what could have been"""
good,"Fast paced work enviornment, employee advancement is very difficult to obtain, morale is low, but compensation is above par."
good,cigna is a pretty cool place to work. As a customer support rep I assist customers with their log in issues which are usually due to forgotten user names or passwords.
good,"Typical day at work was responding to emails, taking inbound phonecalls, making outbound calls to resolve issues or stay in touch with customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was resolving issues the first time, usually by reprocessing a claim while the customer was on the phone, providing them the instant gratification they were looking for. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the ever building workload, the pressure from managers to follow up with a growing list of customers, and getting little support from teammates during the last weeks I worked there. I learned that my priorities did not sync with management's priorities."
good,"Involved taking incoming Pharmacy calls, call center environment Work from Home position,"
good,"I love working for Cigna, great company with great benefits. Many employee perks. I love my job and what I do but, my particular dept. and fellow employees are not great. Very toxic environment because of management. No encouragement, will point out any and all mistakes but never tell you when you are doing a good job, micro managing, and some work place bullying. I have been talked down to, and treated as if I am a child, yelled at, and ridiculed for things that are very irrelevant. Would love to stay with the company but see no opportunities as of now. It is unfortunate because I love the customers I work with and all the vendor relationships I have. Ashamed that a couple of bad apples can spoil the entire experience."
good,"Decent working hours in line with family friendly work guidelines. "
good,"overall enjoyed time at Cigna. Great work life balance.  Opportunities there need to be taken and asked for, advancement is there as long as you're willing to work at it and work for it."
good,This is a well meaning group of people. The lack of process makes it hard to get the work done. Successfully improving creative is another issue. It's possible in some areas.
good,CIGNA had allot of talented people which made working there good.  The department I worked in was full of great people.  The department I worked in was fast paced and the work could be complex at times.  This made each day interesting.
good,"Great company in most regards. Infosec mgt lacks industry experience other than at Cigna. "
good,"Great place to work with great people, a lot of new tech to learn and you can move within the company as long as you're willing to apply yourself. Management will always take on board concerns."
good,A very good effective working environment. Good staff and well rewarded. Good work is recognised and rewarded. A good place to work and would recommend.
good,"Your experience will greatly vary depending on the team and management you work with.  That being said, if you find the right fit, it can be a great job."
good,The company of CIgna was an amazing company to work for with good work life balance. My department  was sold off to another company shortly after going to Cigna.
good,"Its a good place to work. Once you are in the door you can grow as long as you have a good manager.  negotiate high coming in because you wont get raises good raises after that, You will need to transfer positions to get a pay increase. Benefits are good and contribution to HSA."
good,I was an onsite adjuster working at the client's location.  As such there really wasn't any opportunity for advancement unless you wanted to leave that client.  Our caseloads there varied from 125-150. We did not have any onsite management so we had to be self starters requiring little supervision. We had a great team and had good communication and assistance from the client.  The most difficult part of that job centered around the unique needs of the temporary staff. The best part of the job was the teamwork and the overall environment.
good,"Although this was only a seasonal contract position it was an excellent culture, fun place to work, at times stressful but highly competitive.  Most people there were extremely pleasant and fun to be around"
good,I have enjoyed my time there. I have been able to advanced. It is stressful at times. This is something that most have said but it can be rewarding and you can advance.
good,"Typical day would start with me logging on to my computer."
good,"Collect and provide data entry in case systems. Handle multiple products and benefit plans such as Qcare, Provider Link and Medicare Software System. Facilitate the request for prior authorization inpatient and outpatient services, ensuring timely and above 95%accurate responses."
good,"Enjoyed my time, nothing bad to say. Cigna works with you and cares about the customers, I just got bored. Learned about claims, queue management. Hardest part of the job was overtime during the busy season."
good,"i did not want to leave Cigna, my department would not allow me to work from home. so i felt that i lost almost 13 years of experience and felt that i was not appreciated enough to keep as a work from home employee."
good,This is a call center so the work is very fast paced. You are constantly being monitored and barely have time to take a restroom break. If you enjoy talking constantly on a phone this is the job for you.
good,"Overall, a good place to work if you can handle the demands and stress.  Great vacation policy.  Annual reviews to determine if there will be a salary increase.  Not always fair from one employee to the next with same experience, workload and performance, though.  Equal opportunity regardless of age, race, religion or sexual orientation."
good,"They recently took away the sick day benefit that the pharmacists had for 15+ years. But the work/life balance is great, I can hardly put a price on that."
good,Cigna was a fast paced and competitive. Hard place for advancement but had decent pay. Management staff was friendly and easy to work for. The hardest part of the job was being micromanaged.
good,"Workday is between 8 and 10 hours, depending on time of year and flow of business. I learned negotiation skills, how the healthcare industry works, sales skills and working with team mates."
good,"Management makes it difficult to know who you're working for (day-to-day responsibilities, companies being acquired, etc.). Good daily work environment"
good,"Cigna smartly invests in-depth training programs for their entry level employees providing strong foundation skills, however unfortunately the upper level trainings are not regulated so they’re either exceptional or lackluster. For a health insurance company the medical benefits could be better, but are not horrible. Overall the pay scale provided for the work are quite reasonable."
good,I love Cigna as a company but hate the Department that I currently work in. I honestly feel like management only care about metrics instead of the well being of the employees.
good,"Overall, Cigna has been a fantastic company to work for. With a multitude of work at home opportunities, several benefit options and a generous time off and 401k matching policy, Cigna is a great place to work. However, certain organizations within the company can pose hazards and roadblocks for advancement."
good,"Learned in-depth state compliance laws."
good,"Cigna Group Insurance is a solid company to work for. Cigna has great benefits such as Medical, Dental, Vision, 401K and management is normally able to provide flexible schedules."
good,"can afford to pay employees more money, they bring in temps and when they hire them on through the company they pay them .20 cents less and state that PTO makes up for the loss."
good,My review overall was great I always was acknowledge for job well done even with high volume. The company overall was fair and treated  employees with respect. Also was very diverse along with the opportunity for some positions to work from home.
good,"I enjoyed the work I did and the people I worked with. The pace was very fast and the ongoing learning curve steep."
good,"Looking for a diverse company that has a good working environment? Consider, they are a solid organization with years of dedication to their employees, share holders and their Customers"
good,A great company to learn medical insurance benefits. It evolved my medical terminology and medical office skill set. My last manager was a true employee advocate.  Advancement was minimal.  Pay was ok for the time. Benefits were not on par with what Cigna offered to clients.
good,"Cigna is a good place to start your career, depending on the department you land in, advancement can be challenging. Overall though, it will give you a good starting point."
good,"The culture was very team oriented."
good,Confidential atmosphere. Yearly picnics.  Great secretary gifts.
good,"Overall, Cigna was a good place to work. My manager was amazing, but the company got bought out and it became very political and the upper management didn't promote on merit of workmanship, they promoted their friends."
good,"With CGHB it is very dependent on who your manager is. This job is very face paced and stressful. Customers are sometimes very rude and condescending but you can not at any time allow this to change your tone or inflection.In the beginning I loved working for the company but then the management changed and it just went downhill from there. He moves around ""teams"" constantly and you don't always have the same support from one month to the next."
good,Thoroughly enjoy the people I work with and experience received.  Find it harder to find next steps in this field and opportunities like it in the company.
good,"A typical day working for Cigna Healthcare involved direct communication with Employers, Employees, and the client liaison (Client Service Executive). This communication took place via email, telephone, and sometimes postal correspondence. "
good,"Great company to work for.  Lots of change in the area I was located, not bad changes just quite a bit.  Travel was not bad at all.  It was great seeing your peers and working with team on new and existing initiatives.  Great atmosphere.  Sometimes ambiguity, but again, not bad.  It will keep you on your toes."
good,Cigna is a very stressful and high pressure.  The stats have to be met or the employee is walked out the door.  I learned to use several databases at one time.  The hardest part of the job is to stay in que when needed.
good,"Its a good company and well balanced work culture."
good,"A typical day at work was customer serviced based.  I facilitated benefit fairs and updated, amended insureds policies.  I learned the ins and outs of group coveraged, specificallly, life, death and accident."
good,"It really depends on your role with the company and which department you are working with. Some areas, there is little to no chance for advancement. Other areas, are overflowing with opportunity."
good,"I wouldn't leave if there were advancement opportunities,  my market has restricted us from being appropriate candidates for other markets and we've become glorified CSAs"
good,"When Cigna bought out HealthSpring, we assumed everything was great for the new merger. However, many departments were laid off due to relation in Alabama. Great company, poor management."
good,"Good job security and have been loyal to good people who have gone elsewhere and decided to come back. Definitely need to stay organized and manage your time well, if you can do that then this job will be easy for you. Down side of that is that you will get burnt out within a few years if you are not upward moving and that can be challenging. Typical office politics and pay is okay but could be better don't expect much more than yearly merit raises that they try to creatively twist as to why they are so low and maybe youll also get a bonus but don't hold your breath. Overall a good place if you like stability and a steady paycheck but not if you are wanting to advance quickly or want a job that you are excited or proud to tell your friends about."
good,Cigna is a good place to work.  There is a good work life balance and the management is trying to stay competitive int he market place.  Cigna gives good benefits but not great.
good,"Cigna TTK has helped me in learning and  my leadership role."
good,"When restructuring takes place, you are most likely going to loose your job. After 9 years of employment, my most recent position has been eliminated due to outsourcing and although I have been applying within the company, I not been selected for any interviews."
good,"I arrived at 8 am and plugged into my phone, ready to take calls. I mostly answered questions about eligibility and benefits, disputes on claims and resubmitting claims for review. I did enjoy the job but   my husband was transferred and we had to move out of state."
good,"The company is good to work for, they have regular business hours and offer the opprotunity to work from home based on a set list of parameters. Fast paced work enviroment."
good,"I enjoyed my job, but they have gone to contractors instead of employees.  Was let go because there wasn't enough work, after 20 years.  The testing area is not done by people in the US anymore, outsourced to India."
good,"When I worked here, I processed life insurance claims for large policy holders.  It was fast paced and somewhat depressing to have to process claims for those who have died.  I answered phone calls, requested information to process claims."
good,"Even though I was only a contractor at the end of the project, the work environment was good overall. The people friendly and helpful."
good,"I fell that they are not paying the salary for the experience that you have and that the bonus and raises are far an in_between,  I do not feel that things are done fairly there"
good,"The work could be very boring at times but you could wear headphones and just do your job without a lot of at work politics.  Enjoyed paying claims and helping individuals with questions about insurance and setting their minds at ease.  The workplace environment when I was there, was great.  We had CEO's that were awesome to work for and used to reward us very often.  "
good,"It's a good place to meet people with alot of experience in all walks of life. "
good,"I worked full time for 14 years, first as a property damage claims representative, then onto a PIP representative.  I learned so much about insurance and laws during my time there.  I also learned a lot about medical terminology and procedures.  When I first started working for CIGNA, the workplace was very casual. The office relocated several times while I was there.  CIGNA was then bought by ACE Insurance, and the environment changed a bit.  Hours were lengthened, dress was more business attire, but overall, benefits and salary stayed the same.  I found the hardest part of the job to be talking to people who were generally not happy with their situation.  They were either injured or their cars were damaged.  My goal was to try to make them feel ""whole"" again, let them vent to me, and try to resolve all issues to best of my ability.  I enjoyed the people I worked for and with, and still keep in contact with a lot of them, to this day."
good,Poor Management. Projects unfairly balanced. Received no training for core database. Nothing that was discussed during employment negotiations was implemented.
good,A structured and organized workplace with a highly experienced and knowledgeable workforce always willing to assist others.
good,"As an enrollment special I was responsible for educating clients and their employees about the features and benefits of their health plans."
good,"Good work environment. Compensation comparable. Solid company.  I felt respected by my supervisor as she let me work side-by-side with her. Even though we had long work hours in the healthcare regulations department, she always stayed with me.  Enjoyed it."
good,hardest part of the job are the work hours and work life balance. I learned a lot regarding insurance.  My co workers were great and always willing to assist new hires.
good,Call-center focused company which provides job opportunities for a mass variety of educational backgrounds and potential for job growth within the company.
good,During my 3 years stay in Cignal TV I enjoyed a lot wherein I performed various jobs. It's hard but its challenging since I was able to maximize my time wisely.
good,"a typical day was 9am- 5pm"
good,"Very large organization that is very big on training.  They give you various  options concerning training (completing your degree, certifications, etc...).  Plenty options for advancement. Fitness center."
good,Sagamore Health operates somewhat independent of Cigna with a group called Payer Solutions. The network is segmented for security and room for growth. Lots of opportunity for learning. Team is small and goal oriented. Patching and security are paramount.
good,Cigna is a good company to work for. I enjoyed being part of their Agile Transformation. Team oriented environment. Wonderful Managers.
good,Coworkers were so easy to get along with and management really took communicating with their employees to the next level.
good,"Good people, considerate of each others feelings - they look to get involved in community and positive causes both in and outside of work."
good,Provide superior client support and customer care to Healthspring customers. process request from medical providers for procedure approval under the medicare guidelines.
good,"I reviewed health care providers applications for credentialing, making sure that all their licenses were in order and all the medicare required compliant information was included. One of the best things about the job was the flexibility about hours, because we were production based, as long as you made your numbers they are very flexible about time off; we were allowed to make up 8 hours a week if necessary, and they provide 144 hours of PTO. I really liked being able to throw on headphones and play music while I processed and verified applications and licenses. I learned a lot about more back end enrollment processes, expanding the entirety of my knowledge of health care and how it works, now I'm skilled in benefits, claims, enrollment/eligibility, as well as provider side contracting and provider services. I think one of the biggest challenges was the training, it wasn't very comprehensive, thankfully everyone looks out for each other and supports each other. I really liked the actual work I did. Management left something to be desired, but everyone in my department who did the processing really supported each other where it lacked from management so its almost a moot point."
good,CIGNA themselves are an awesome company to work for. However call center work is not easy and sometimes can be overwhelming. You don't get much time in between calls and sometimes cannot find the right answers to the questions that the callers are asking for due to lack of information in the system.
good,"Productive and exciting place to be.  Assisting members in resolving issues to get their medications, reviewing their pharmacy benefits.  Managers do their best to develop you on your career path"
good,"•	Maintain eligibility for Automated, Direct Connection, and Manual accounts. "
good,"My typical day at cigna is patient interaction, customer service, building good patient relationships, and achieving my work day goals. I'm constantly learning and improving everyday in my phlebotomy career growing personally and professionally. I have some of the best co-workers at cigna medical group that are professional and personal friends. The work environment is one of the best I've worked in. The management is ok with alot of room for improvement. In my observation management leans toward favoritism a great deal which is hindering advancement and growth. The hardest thing about my job is dealing with irrate patients but the most enjoyable is connecting with people all around me, patients and co-workers. No job is perfect but if you work for your success perfection is never out of reach."
good,Peers are always helpful and supportive of each other. As a global company they are supportive of work from home days. Many products and services to learn.
good,Learn new technologies . No work-life balance . Hectic Work. Learn Insurance domain . Management not so supportive . Low salary .
good,"Set-up account structure & billing."
good,"The work enviornment is very nice. Learning here can be difficult at times, but everyone is willing to help. Advancement is easy."
good,"I am fortunate enough to work with employees on their health improvement goals and objectives. Additionally, I am involved with onsite work wellness offer a variety of activities throughout the year to promote and engage employees in healthy behaviors."
good,"Management and training needs improvement as it seems as though things are rushed into production, and going forward things are reactive versus proactive. Individuality is promoted however not accepted when suggestions are made for process improvement."
good,"Working here has certainly been a great stepping stone to develop in my customer service experience and fine tune the importance of confidentiality. Data entry may seem mundane for some, however it does help build the practice for consistency and teach to look out for standout issues to address promptly in an office environment."
good,My typical included processing claims remotely. The most challenging in the position was keeping abreast of all the changes that was taking place in the healthcare industry and claim payment guidelines.
good,"Company is good to work for, expect a lot of hours off the clock but you can work remotely as well. I learned a lot about International health benefits and the difference with International healthcare as to US. The people are great to work for although most of the job required first hand knowledge, didn't get much training."
good,"Every day was a challenge and an opportunity to learn something new. Management and peers were very supportive. "
good,Solid insurance company.  Changing its culture.  Much new and old product development.
good,A typical day consisted of working overtime daily and taking 50-70 calls in a call center. I myself completed plan changes and trained other people via telephone and in office on how to use new programs and complete plan changes. Management was very helpful at times.
good,"CIGNA work at home employees are allowed the flexibility to grow in your personal surroundings which adds to a conducive learning environment.  This role requires you to be disciplined, organized and able to balance your work/home life.  The company itself has put a lot of emphasis on detail reporting to assist with understanding its goals."
good,Having put in 6 years with a Law Firm is a very good reference to have on your resume.  Learned a lot.
good,Avg workday can range from 5am to 10pm in a span in which you can complete your required time...Very helpful for those that have a very busy lifestyle.
good,Job security is never a problem. The job is rewarding being that you are assisting people in need but the workload can be massive and not possible to accomplish in an 8 hour day.
good,I came in to adjust the cultural environment and to increase efficiency of the existing teams. I became responsible for everything IT in the Austin Area making sure the Business had everything then needed to succeed in their activities.
good,Working in CIGNA is very happy life. Need a change in my career
good,International company that values customer centricity.  Multi-cultural fast paced work environment.  Current and value empowering the customer to make educated decisions.
good,Its a good place to work at. When I moved into a new role. The internal move was difficult. Lack of training with no one to turn to.
good,"Fun learning job with great training methods. Great people, with positive attitudes towards learning."
good,Cigna offered great online courses to help you better understand their amazing wellness programs and their company overall. They always have webinars in play to assist you in learning new things. Cigna is a big company with countless opportunities to grow and move into different positions within their company. They also recognize good and dedicated employees.  The management team is always available to assist if you are having any issues and will help you come to a resolution quickly. The hardest part of the job was probably not having a work/life balance opportunity available for my position because I unfortunately had to resign because I had a newborn at the time and wanted to stay home with her. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to assist our clients and resolve their issues and put a smile back on their face!
good,Learned a great deal. Co-workers were extremely nice and helpful.
good,It is a positive environment to work in and continuously growing.
good,"Although tenure was short and this was due to the company's merger change UNUM to CIGNA, the UNUM culture was focused on training and employee advancement."
good,"Learned computer skills"
good,"Friendly co-workers who are willing to help when needed, some unique benefits such as ability to make up time and buy extra PTO, hardest part of the job is learning about insurance products, how to read support and handle the multitude of tasks."
good,"Often difficult for project teams to connect their work with overall company mission/strategy. Senior managers have very high expectations, but remain detached from connecting with lower-level teams. This has been my experience. I cannot speak for others."
good,"Working for Cigna has been very advantageous for me.  I've learned so much about healthcare and I understand how important and necessary it is.  I've learned how to read hospital contracts, client's benefits, and how to pay medical claims.  I realized that each claim is connected to an individual, so I took pride in paying the claim correctly and/or taking necessary steps to get information that was needed.  I enjoyed this job because it gave me the ability to depend on myself.  My work is prioritized and I know what needed to be done. I'd like to continue my professional experience assisting a company achieve their goals while also reaching my own."
good,"large book of business"
good,I like working here for the benifits and normal business hours
good,"Every day it was the same duties to perform,filing locating claims,answering phones,but the staff there was great it made work a wonderful and pleasant experience. Small work environment,best to keep chatter to a minimum.   "
good,"Technically I worked for IKON (now RICOH) Office Solutions, which was located at CIGNA Headquaters. At this internship I learned how to use Abode and Command workstation to fulfill customers' orders, which tended to be booklets, copies, or posters. At times I had to use UPS Campus Ship to send copies to other CIGNA locations. I found this job to be very useful and rewarding. The pay was good and the work environment was pretty well suited."
good,Contracting and credentialing for future healthcare providers.
good,"They are very systematic, Co workers will do everything to help. Management knows how to lead"
good,- This was the most diverse environment that I had the opportunity to be a part of.
good,Cigna is a company that you can grow with and learn. You can utilize online education classes.
good,I enjoyed the support that was provided for my personal career growth.
good,"Really great company with lots of opportunity to advance. The management team really looked after their employees and the company always had Work Instructions located in various database to make your job easier. If you work hard you are recognized and rewarded constantly. The hardest part of the job is the Quality Assurance department had different standards/rules depending on who was doing the Audit, but management is always fair to the employees and would give any support or handle any issue that needed to be addressed."
good,Great company always looking for ways to get better.
good,CIGNA HealthCare was a tremendous organization that appealed to all. It was very task oriented and management fully supported individual thinking.
good,"Answering phones, paying medical claims, organizing desk, helping other with time to process claims. Co-workers were fun it was my first real job and I learned alot of customer service skills."
good,"It was very fast environment, I was able to keep up. Everyone was really nice and helpful in helping me learn new things."
good,Good company to work for. Average benefits and compensation. Questionable management decision making but a comfortable work environment. Not a very diverse workforce. Excellent place for women to work.
good,"I first worked on the phones, after a year of that department I was ready for a change. I was allowed to train to pay claims so much nicer. After six months I was allowed to work at home. I did this for almost nine years. Best thing ever, would love that opportunity again."
good,Love working for Cigna. I've been here for almost eight years. The health benefits could be better but their other employee benefits outweigh the healthcare benefits.
good,Good company to work for but if you have people on your team that so nothing you will have to pick up the slack. It's really hard to g to people moved or fired.
good,"Typical of a large healthcare insurance company. Some teams I worked for were great and others were difficult.I enjoyed working with good people but until I was laid off. "
good,"Great work environment, with great coworkers. Management is always available to talk if you have suggestions or concerns. Great benefits and PTO. Plenty of potlucks."
good,"Structured work place, accountable stats, flexible work hours, answering phone calls consulting with members concerns about policy or claim processing, filing and processing claims, eligibility, health coverage, data entry, multiple computer systems, multiple phone lines."
good,I have enjoyed my time at Cigna until I took a position with the wrong manager. The work/life balance and flexibility of schedule had been amazing until my last position there.
good,"Cigna is a good company to work for and an outstanding starting job for a recent college graduate. "
good,"I love Cigna . I love helping people .You are  answering constatant  inbound calls all day . You are to follow a set schedule daily and those stats along with other sets of stats reflect you as an employee. You speak to pharmacies, Dr offices , patients , caretakers and other insurances . You problem solve to make sure the member is being educated on their insurance plan as well as assisted through any obstacles . The patients need to be fully advised as what to expect from the beginning of the call . The home delivery side of things is easier . We place orders , set up deliveries , take payments and make outbound calls to Dr offices if necessary ."
good,I work from home so I don't see anyone. I do my work and they pay me every two weeks. Can't really complain about that. No real room for advancement since no one sees you.
good,"Currently work from home. Company value work/life balance with flexible work schedule or remote roles. There are plenty of career opportunities, but pay is not the best compared to the market or smaller companies."
good,"Advancement can be difficult, however great place to work. There are many benefits that would contribute personal development such as bonuses, education reimbursement."
good,Cigna is a great place to work. I believe I should be making a higher salary but it's not a hard position. Great flexibilty and work-life balance is actually great!
good,The pay was excellent! Co workers were great! I just got tired of the cubicle life. 7 hours a day in a small cubicle doing pre-certifications. Calling members when they were denied. Dealing with providers who want DME but don’t send in supporting clinical. Long waits on hold with DME companies.
good,cigna was a great place to work and learn about both the insurance and customer service aspects of call center work it was an amazing experience to have worked there
good,Cigna is not a bad company to work just wish there was more room for growth and more opportunities to advance. The environment is very laid back and they do a lot of events for team building and holidays
good,There are pros and cons of working for a large organization.  The challenges are standard and can be overcome with teamwork and keen attention to managing change and the people impacted.
good,"Leaders understand the importance of work/life balance and encourage you to use your PTO. In addition, they look to align you with projects/initiatives that align with your career goals."
good,Always challenging and fun environment. Fast paced and plenty of opportunities to move around and gain diverse experiences. Would definitely recommend this as a great place to work!
good,Flexibility is the key to a positive experience. Sales and client management seek to meet and exceed sales goals and client experience. Good employee benefits with opportunity for interpersonal growth.
good,"Cigna is a very good place to work at. It is quick paced and the pay is good. The management at Cigna is great, they are very professional, and they genuinely care about employees."
good,There was always someone who was a resource for questions and problems. Opportunities for advancement was dependent on the department. Good benefits and salary.
good,"Love the work but compensation, benefits and advancement are lacking. For a health insurance company the benefits should be way more affordable.  I like the people."
good,"A great place to work, comfortable environment. Nice people and a very clean work place. Plenty of parking, security was helpful to everyone. 2 weeks of training was plenty to grasp the data entry concepts."
good,I worked for this company for 5 years. I enjoyed the daily challenges that were offered through the work. My pay was sufficient to meet the needs of my family. I however was completely blindsided by the elimination of my position and therefore the release of my duties from the company.
good,"Overall,  Cigna is a great organization to work for. The diversity and inclusion groups the organization portrayed  is what caught my attention. Cigna offered many opportunities to grow your career and provided many engagement opportunities for employees once the initial first years was completed. I Will be happy to discuss in detail upon interview."
good,"Cigna was a great place to work with good benefits.  The organization is very professional with a strong mission plan that they, for the most part stick to and live by."
good,"Productive environment to work in. Business casual attire, some work from home opportunities. Benefits available. Friendly work environment, as well. Good opportunity for advancement in some departments."
good,"Cigna offers great benefits and competitive pay.  There is room for career progression and during my time there, was promoted several times. It is a fast paced environment."
good,"Management and mentorship lacking, however overall good company. I believe in what I do, and take pride in what I provide to the company and its clients."
good,CIGNA does an outstanding job at developing high potential talent and invests in professional development for early career talent.  CIGNA is also good with internal mobility opportunities.
good,Great salary and benefits however little room for growth within the company. You are able to flex your schedule to some extent when you work from home. Processes are changing weekly if not daily.
good,"*A typical day at work involves incoming calls for new and existing claims and taking action on post and email allocations."
good,"I enjoyed working for Cigna until I had constant turn around of supervisors for my team. After the fifth supervisor change in two years, the supervisor was very micromanaging of employees that are very capable of minimal supervision."
good,Company changed over the years.  Really charging into the future now. Good pay and benefits. Very competitive.. Upgrading technology. CEO is charismatic.
good,Working at CIGNA I learned quite about the health insurance industry and bidding out for new clients.  Upper management was good however lots of politics in the mid and lower levels.  One of the most difficult aspects was dealing with widely varying personalities.
good,"Open to work from home"
good,"CIGNA overall is a great company. Advancement is often based on who you know and not necessarily your quality of work. Work/Life Balance is great, very flexible. PTO is very generous."
good,Cigna is a great place to work; from the on-site cafe that offers healthy eating; close parking spots; great staff and good working hours you really cant go wrong; I do wish there was a better structure for manager to employee relationship but if thats the only down side then a win is a win
good,Cigna is a good place to work if you are okay with being complacent. They do have good work life balance with most jobs being work from home. The hardest part of the job is dealing with different personalities with customers.
good,When I stated Cigna they were just getting started in Chicago so a lot of kinks were still being worked out but overall it seemed like it was going to be a great place to work long-term. One of the major perks is that I worked from home!
good,Cigna offers opportunities for employees to gain experience in the insurance field. It’s a fast pace environment with great benefits and a great work culture
good,"From the day I walked through the door, everyone was so inviting and friendly and very helpful. We did a lot of fun activities. It was nice to know there was a company that would actually take the time to train you and help you through the tough times of the learning process, being something new to me. I enjoy what i do and the people, we have to move on, because our positions are being sent to India."
good,"East coast work mentality, you're here to work and fun is not a necessity. Can be very stressful at times outsourced a lot of jobs to save money after ACA passed and implemented."
good,"Cigna is a very productive , encouraging and enlightening place . You must be at your best always but even if you have an issue , Cigna is ready to help you resolve it."
good,It is a good place to work for. The people I worked with is very knowledgeable. The benefits is good but they don't pay their employees very well. What i like about Cigna is that there is lot of opportunities for Career growth. I would not mind working again for Cigna.
good,My role requires constant multi-tasking with work in multiple systems. I have numerous stretch assignments in addition to my main role. The Utilization Review Department requires the nurse to expand their overall knowledge in all areas of nursing. I have learned multiple computer systems and applications as well as working virtually for training and meeting purposes. There are many benefits for employees.
good,Overall is was a nice place to work. I unfortunately had a horrible supervisor that made working there overly stressful. Not to mention the mandatory overtime was extreme especially for those with children or working the evening shift.
good,"Seeing patients for nurse visits and as walk ins without an appointment, IV and venipuncture therapies, telephone triage, assist with procedures in office, refill prescriptions per protocol.  Hardest part was dealing with high volume of upper management change and best part was helping the patients and providers."
good,"nice place to work."
good,"I love the job do to you are not micromanaged. Everyone  is helpful around the company. Great job just not enough pay, No benefits. have good options on moving up  in the company"
good,Management and staff were very pleasant always willing to teach something  new. Each employee was cross-trained for the pharmacy area which I found difficult but challenging. The hardest part was learning how to keep up with conveyor belt when packing medicine for shipment.
good,"Monitoring the employees to ensure their following the proper procedures of the company. I monitor calls, coached team members. Handled disciplinary paper work. Since working with Cigna HealthSpring, I've learned patience, learned more about healthcare and a lot about the different software.What makes my work place enjoyable is my team."
good,Work at home currently with nice flex time.  Management in my current role is amazing. Some micro mangement with reporting and quality but overall nice.  You do your work you won't have any problems.
good,It's one of the great place to work. Well manage management. Good pay master. But need more brand promotion. Product is little more expensive as par market. Network of hospitals are less.
good,"Loaded contract specifics with providers into system for correct plan reimbursement to provider.  Audit physician contact, panel and specialty information."
good,"Productive, fun steady paced work environment. Must take the required breaks to work around, stretch and drink something. Milestones are celebrated by the Manager for the staff. Food ordered for such occasion."
good,"good place to work, enjoyed working here. lots of turn over and hard to move u. but overall a good place to work to get started and to get experience in a career. Its a good back up if you're in between jobs"
good,great environment to work and learn the healthcare business. moderate compensation and good benefits. management was one hundred percent supportive in my individual advancement.
good,"Company is adapting to Agile, but has a long way to go until the SAFe process is standardized across the corporation."
good,It is a decent place to work if you don't want to learn new positions. Management was fair and always wanted you to do well. It is not a place to move up in the company on your own with your experiences. Management promotes people in positions that they don't have the experience with that position.
good,"This is a fairly decent place to work.  Casual work atmosphere where independent and team players alike can flourish. Onsite perks are minimal, but the laid back atmosphere makes up for the lack of benefits."
good,"The management at Cigna encourages employees to seek opportunities to improve themselves and grow within the company. Compensation for additional hours worked is very fair, and the benefits package is excellent."
good,"Cigna is a large company with lots of room for advancement.  I met wonderful, smart, professional people while working there who care about the members."
good,"I have been unable to grow in my current position. Work life balance is wonderful, but each of these depends on the department you work in. "
good,"I enjoy working here, however Management tends to do a generalization instead of an individual approach when it comes to corrective action.  It is an experience that can very from person to person."
good,"Cigna is a great place to work. "
good,"Cignal TV is one of the strongest company in pay TV. Associated with TV5 and an arm of PLDT, company structure is well developed. Areas of opportunity are Employee Relations and Work and Life Balance promotion."
good,"I was an intern 5 years ago now.  Overall, it was a good place to work.  Their internship paid me well in a field where most interns don't get paid.  I would recommend for an internship."
good,"Home visits and documentation at home"
good,"This company schedules employees to work at home 2 days a week."
good,"- Being an underwriter, a typical day a work could include any number of tasks. After a three month training program, the job begins. Learning to use several different systems and best underwriting practices, providing consultative services to the clients, and predicting risk are large facets of the job."
good,"Other than being laid off, I enjoyed working with organization. I was able to achieve company goals monthly. The incentives to do well was always the company's endeavor. This company gave me the opportunity to serve others."
good,"If you want to work in an inbound call center - this is a great job for you.  Must be able to multi-task.  Paid training.  I've learned a lot working here.  Management is ok, coworkers are great.  Hardest part - being on the phone for hours at a time. Most enjoyable part - lunchtime and breaks!"
good,Large company that cares about the Health and Wellness of their employees.  A company that supports higher learning training through outside vendors.
good,Wonderful place to work. Great environment and friendly people. I was able to work from home and I really appreciate that aspect.
good,"Great place to get exposure to case management in managed care and community environment.  A lot of constantly changing requirements, especially for documentation needs."
good,My time at Cigna was brief but they were very respectful to me. I left because I wanted to get back into patient care. I really liked the management at Cigna.
good,Front Desk greets most every employee with a smile. Quiet and quaint work environment very nice repor with staff and management. However not a lot of employee empowerment group or team building skills set. Helping others was  the most enjoyable part of my position here @ Cigna Health Spring
good,"Overall Cigna is a company with a good heart, led by mostly good, smart, capable people. Unfortunately there is a strong component of old guard which do hold back progression and innovation. They are trying hard to be innovators in the marketplace, but until more significant investment in future technology and their employees is made, they will struggle."
good,"This is a mega insurance company, I was there for almost 10 years.  I started as a Data Entry clerk..and moved to a team lead then a customer trainer.  A typical day when I first started was Data entry for client and group information.  I learned that if you are determined to make it you can.  I was a good source of support to managers and my co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was the calls in que when recieving health insurance inquiries.  The most enjoyable part was meeting the daily require calls to received and have a successful day."
good,I worked in Lake Mary. It was a laid back atmosphere. The job was very easy. We did not work on Fridays. I did not have any issues or problems when I was there for the 3 months.
good,best place for doctors to make career as general physician one has develop his practice.Help given to improve academic skills.
good,"High Inbound Call Center"
good,"Definitely enough work to keep you busy as a Claims Manager but with the telephone ringing non-stop as if you are in a call-center makes almost impossible to complete one tasks. Also, answering calls for Claims Managers customers and not having knowledge of their contracts and terms of disability makes it hard to provide good customer service."
good,"unit clerk in the back office at an urgent care. processing orders, injections, blood draws, charge entry."
good,"-Learned the process of underwriting"
good,i'm happy being part of my company i have a lot of experiences and happy moment with them. i gain many knowledge and skills to them and the best part of it is they were proud of me being there employee and co workers.
good,Would encourage anyone to apply for Cigna Denison. It's a good company to work for. Managers in the Dental department are rally good to work for.
good,"I enjoyed working here, due to market changes our jobs was moved to Conn. I worked with the liaisons between Cigna and other market managers to insure their claims was processed properly and in a timely manner."
good,"I enjoyed working at HealthSpring/Cigna while I was assigned Inpatient Hospitals. I was moved to physician reviews which led to boredom. I would have stayed with this company for as long as they would have me, IF I continued reviewing Inpatient coding."
good,Diverse. Great job culture.  Some advancements automatic.  Deal with a lot of changes.  Management is great depending on your department.
good,"Good company to work for.  Different opportunities for advancement and training."
good,Productive and Professional workplace. People are professional and courteous. Overall fun and enjoyable environment with supportive coworkers.
good,Work will constantly keep you busy and you will never have the same day twice.  New challenges are brought forth each day.
good,Cigna has great benefits and the environment is wonderful. Great company to work for!
good,"Cigna offered employees a fair opportunity to work from home. They applied their rules unilaterally and really never considered the person's situation. I liked my work schedule and the ability to work from home. The work at home program was rigorous, however when you see the lack of oversight within other companies who have such programs, you can really see why Cigna viewed the program as a privilege and not a right."
good,The company it self was good to work for. But job security and management left a little to be desired.
good,"Consistent amount of daily task and project work available at the Team Leader level. The teams are focused on the impact that they have on each and every customer and strive to improve on an already positive customer experience. "
good,"A typical day at work consisted of working 8 hours between 08:00-21:00 with a given break of 1 hour half way through the day."
good,"It seems, however, that the higher you move up the ladder, the less approachable and friendly you become."
good,"Cigna-HealthSpring is a great place to work.  With the 2011 acquisition by Cigna, it's changing rapidly."
good,HealthSpring is a comfortable place to work with lots of incentives.
good,"A great  place to work.  Opened job opportunities for many employees.  I was part of a 115 people workforce in my unit, but, all of our work went to India."
good,I have a tremendous amount about the insurance industry.  I manage inventory (claims and appeals); prioritize and load balance based on daily needs; manage and direct up to 32 direct reports; lead for selecting new candidates; problem solve difficult cases; serve on committees and specialty teams as needed.
good,"Great Company, lack of good management, which always led to issues within the department."
good,Great place and environment to work. Management is not all that great depending on dept.
good,"Processed medical claims in a high production level environment. Learned to process claims with high quality standards that would get the claim paid without errors. Help always was well available from fellow co-workers when needed, but for more serious issues help was  not always immediate when conferring with upper management."
good,"Training a team on compliance and procedures involving Medicare, Medicaid, Medicare Advantage Plans, and how to help prospects make the right choice for additional coverage to Medicare if needed."
good,"high volume calling center, able to answer members inquiries, work well with coworker, fun but serious environment"
good,I worked at this company almost 10 years and only left due to a layoff
good,"the work@home program is awesome!"
good,Got good experience from CIGNA from my superiors as well as sub-ordinates. I enjoyed working here
good,"Quickly and effectively solving customer challenges."
good,"Very friendly, work/life balance oriented atmosphere. Very flexible. PTO benefits are really good from day of hire. However medical benefits are not the best I have had."
good,"What I like about Cigna is that the focus truly is on the customers and doing right by them. It is difficult to work in an industry where the general public tends to demonize you, but this place really strives to focus on wellness and preventative healthcare. A typical day at work is very busy. Not burn out busy, but challenging and exciting busy. Cigna is also open to feedback and willing to listen to its employees. They are attempting to make strides at providing a better work/life balance. For instance, they are creating a shared laptop program so individuals can work from home 1-2 days a month. A typical day is talking to facilities, managing benefits, creating authorizations, writing up reports, auditing, data collection, scheduling reviews, distributing cases to care management staff, and the list goes on. It is key to know how to use the systems, and be proficient in Excel, Word, and outlook. The co-workers are probably the best part of the job. There is a great sense of cohesion and caring for one another. I've learned how to be flexible, compassionate, positive, open minded, and how to work fast, fast, fast! And here is my criticism of the company. There are not a lot of opportunities for those that do not and are not going to get their master in a psychological field such as social work, counseling, etc... Additionally, I will admit this may be hearsay, but I hear that Cigna is lower paying than the other insurance companies in the area and that does feel like a let down. "
good,"Working from home I was able to set my own schedule as long as I got my hours in Mon-Fri between 6am and 10pm. I worked independently and all contact with co-workers was by phone. I learned to be flexible, self-motivated and disciplined. The hardest part of the job for me was missing the day to day comradeship I had with my co-workers in the office. The other challenge was the constant changes that happen in the insurance industry, one has to be able to handle change. The best part of the job was the flexibility and constant work flow.  "
good,Was a good place to work. Restructured and management cared about employees more than static rules. Closed due to new bidding structure in insurance or would still be working there.
good,Filling and Packing Prescriptions was a typical day for me at this workplace. I learned how to work with professionals and become efficient in my job. Management was great they were easy to talk to you and willing to work with you if there were problems. There was always a open door policy. Enjoyed working with co-workers I got along with everyone and it was great teamwork. The hardest part of the job was sometimes trying to keep up with the quotas. The most enjoyable part of the job is working in a diverse environment.
good,"I worked for the customer service dept for Private Fee For Service for about a year and three months, and I honestly enjoyed my job!"
good,"was not there very long due to private circumstances, however a typical day was all about learning, learned a lot about different insurance plans and how the work. the management was very pleasant and smart. my co-workers were awesome and everyone got along. the hardest part of the training was so much information to go over in short period of time. brain overload. the best part of the training was the pleasant trainers and great people in class."
good,working with sales to Implement account 2013 WEB site for Emps. access to their new and changing benefits.
good,"I enjoyed working with my coworkers and superiors,it does have benefits, not very good but still has then."
good,"Department I worked in had no concept of team work, it made it hard to work as team. Poor Management in some departments."
good,"-Work with wonderful people who each display the true meaning of the word ""teammate"""
good,"Cigna is on of the most admired healthcare companies in the world today. The tenure I enjoyed there was a great experience and a wonderful learning opportunity. I had the chance to work with some very talented coworkers, and felt pride in the many accomplishments we made together."
good,Call center work is a very high functioning position. Must have patience and problem solving skills. Being a customer service representative requires working as a team and being a leader at the same time.
good,Basically a good place to work. Benefits started one the first day of hire.
good,"Multi-tasking is a required skill, training is excellent, excellent support system, team mentality, and also the ability to contribute as an individual and advance in knowledge and skills."
good,Had great growth opportunities at Cigna.  Great benefits.  Can make a good career at Cigna with a good manager coupled with individual taking on new learning opportunities.
good,"If you are willing to learn and take advantage of all of the educational, environmental and social opportunities offered at Cigna you will excel.  You get out of it what you invest in it. I enjoyed Cigna greatly and learned a lot from each position I was in."
good,As a contractor at Cigna I was able to perform my responsibilities independently with minimal oversight.  I had the ability to work remotely when necessary.  More often than not the work week was 50 - 60 - hours but compensation was for 40 hours.  Some discretionary compensation time off as a balance.
good,"I worked in a call center, assisting employees with training, mentoring and side by sides. I was responsible for assisting coworkers with difficult calls daily."
good,"The job was stressful, even with the training program there are so many things that aren't addressed before being set free to guide someone in the processes with their healthcare issues. You are verbally attacked without a defense. Management doesn't know the product therefore can't assist the employees. Cigna could be an excellent career choice if their were options for growth"
good,Very fast paced company with quotas. It has a competitive environment with typical call center feel. There's a friendly atmosphere that can soften the stress.
good,"there are alot of roles that someone can do at cigna, the pay is a bit uncommunicative."
good,"Although the job was intense and difficult to find work life balance it was a great place to work.  The people are smart and great to work with.  "
good,"I personally do not like someone over my shoulder and micro management is not good especially if you do your job well, I would suggest that you get a job with this company that not on the phone dealing with customers."
good,I loved working with Cigna. It is a great company to work for and the management cares about the individual. Th line of work is just something I am looking to change.
good,"I had a great manager and great team mates.  The training was sufficient.  Call center work is hard, especially when you're telling people on a daily basis that they can't have the medication that they need to live or lead a productive life."
good,Cigna equips you with the required tools to be productive in the workplace. Job metrics are attainable and the rewards are great. The company values the employees and has fair processes.
good,Working at Cigna was a good job but the salary was lower than what I would prefer for my area.  Very little opportunity for raises and career advancement without a Bachelor's Degree.
good,"Very face paced environment. For the call center, you’re expected to focus on quality of handling the call and resolving the issue, instead of the number of calls. What is tough is adherence (for some). Take your breaks at break time and be working when"
good,"Great company to work for, good benefits. Gets crazy around open enrollment time and some managers / directors are stingy with money. I found out when I left that I was paid barely more than half of what other people in the same role made all because my boss was cheap. Advancement opportunities abound and you can be cross trained for other work."
good,"Working for Cigna is mostly rewarding. If you enjoy customer service and striving to do your absolute best to assist people then this is the perfect job for you. If answering call after call does not bother you, this is the job for you. The job is a high stress environment. You do have metrics to meet and not all of the metrics are completely under your control. if you continue to strive for betterment you will go further."
good,"Cigna is a great health care company to  work for,  They offer good benefits and a stable work environment.  The health care industry is a stressful but Cigna tries to offer a less stressful environment."
good,I enjoyed working for Cigna.  This organization invests many resources into developing it's team and provides staff with opportunities for growth.  Management can be very supportive in helping their team to grow.
good,"Cigna insurance has a very high standard which they are continuously trying to improve ti ensure the bust customer journey. "
good,Cigna is a good place to work that offers several advancement opportunities from entry level job roles. It does become more difficult to continue your advancement into higher job roles after one or two advancements though.
good,"A typical day at Cigna is very fast paced. It can be stressful at times but life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it. It seems like ""Corporate America"" policies plague most workplaces however with the right attitude and work ethic, advancement is very achievable in Cigna. The main thing is customer centricity, so in order to be successful there you have to be willing to put customers above yourself. I only left due to relocating to an area where Cigna was not available."
good,"I worked at Cigna as marketing Insight Intern for the past four months in summer. "
good,"I worked for Cigna after being hired from Kelly Services. I retired because I had personal commitments and wanted to go back to"
good,"Cigna work culture is amazing.  Our CEO is encouraging of work/life balance at all times."
good,Great company. My role provided WFH option which was great! Raises are not that great. High volume of work but you just get it done as the work is very time sensitive. No real downtime anymore but that in fact equates to job security. Great benefits and culture. They definitely are innovators in terms of Health insurance carriers.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity I had at Cigna to help identify, create and then teach professional development curriculum. Having the change to train new underwriters, and sales staff was something I truly enjoyed."
good,"Loved working at home but roles were constantly changing,  changed managers often which ultimately led to my termination due to a lack of communication regarding my current situation"
good,Cigna has a good work and life balance policy and gives ample PTO for use. There is opportunity to transfer between departments which allows an employee to stay and grow within the company. They have flexible hours and work from home opportunities as well.
good,"Cigna offers excellent work life balance and a competitive salary. The cultural is laid back; but can be very competitive pending on department you're in. Overall, cigna is a great place to work."
good,Truly appreciate the ability to work remotely as well as the suburb style campus in Bloomfield for the times when you are in the office.  Having a gym on campus was a real benefit that was greatly appreciated.
good,"Cigna was a great place to work. Very flexible and I live that I was able to work from hime, made it very easy tinwork around my childrens schedule. Cigna also have great vacation benefits."
good,"Cigna is a great employer.  They offer a lot of paid time off per year that increases with longevity with the company.  They also offer great work-from-home opportunities for some positions.  For the most part, the staff and managers are rather friendly and easy to get along with.  There are also many opportunities to post out to different positions within the company."
good,Great mission to serve it customer/clients.  High standards. My personal experience is that Cigna falls short in allowing its employees with specific professional backgrounds to advance within the company regardless of their experience.
good,"Though the job is being outsourced shortly, how it is being handled is with the department in mind.  They have been very kind about the situation.  I would consider continuing working here if a new position is made available in the office."
good,"- No one bothers you. Come to work, follow the directive, focus on the task, then everyone is happy. Work issues are dealt with professionally both the supervisors and pharmacists. The challenging part of the job is to be accurate when working with prescriptions, it is achievable as long as you're focused.  The most enjoyable part of the job is people are nice both supervisors and pharmacists. Questions are being answered in a timely manner."
good,Working here is really stressful everything has to be done rapidly and accurately. Breaks and lunches are never at a set time. By the end of the day you have taken more than 80 calls.
good,Highly Progressive company that offers generous benefits and potential for growth. Highly Recommend for recent college graduates and young candidates with substantial experience. The working environment in Hartford is 'tight'. Expect to work within ear-shot of colleges - limited space has forced some ares to work in very close proximity - without dividers. Lay-offs are aggressive and outsourcing prevails.
good,Constant interactions with internal and external partners. Always changing to meet the demands of the customers needs. There are many employees that have been there from 20 to 30+ years.
good,"Interesting work, with decent technology stack, good work-life balance. Colleagues very friendly, management open to suggestions, decent benefits and perks"
good,"Back to back incoming calls for medical insurance. Great training program, I didn't know much about insurance and they provided me all the skills and resources to be a successful representative. Had an outstanding manager."
good,this is an excellent place for new grads to begin their career and advance up the ladder.  Stable job for excellent employees with good benefits and great work environment
good,Cigna was a good company to work for the compensation was good based on experience. The job of a customer service rep was easy once you knew where to locate information.
good,"A good place to work, where you have lot of opportunities to improve in career as long as you learn stuff and adopt to changes in the environment. good place."
good,Work at home position. Reviewed inpatient and outpatient services for transplant and oncology customers. Learned to quickly adapt to changing business needs.
good,"- A typical work day was very busy and fast paced, responding to emails, attending meetings all while still completing required daily task."
good,Easy to work for. lots Autonomy.easy access to training. Ability to advance based on performance first. If not for the budget cuts I would still be there.
good,very good employer. most positions in the company were in face paced environments.  company had good benefits and comparable salary of other similar companies. opportunity for advancement. convenient locations.
good,"Great people to work with; nurses well trained; management conducive to independent thought.  Was going to be promoted when I left."
good,its a great enviroment to work it depends on your customer service experience the training is very informative and the schedule is good as well . you just have to have patience
good,"Proud to have worked there.  Great culture.   Flexible work at home arrangements.   Treat providers as partners."
good,"Like the people I worked with. and the meeting new and old patients. I learn a lot during odds jobs for people, But sometime when you see things that are NOT right in the work place and you report it, They make you look like the BAD person, and Some people get a way with ALOT of stuff,"
good,During my time as a business analyst at Cigna I had the best manager.  He was a great teacher and I learned so many lessons that I carry with me.  He would always push me just out of my comfort zone to make me a better employee.  I would work for him again in a heartbeat.
good,Overall pleasant but there was room for improvement The health care benefits package could have been better. The hardest part of the job is dealing with people's healthcare benefits. You must be able to strike the appropriate balance of compassion and professionalism.
good,I was hired to input medical claims and process them according to their insurance coverage.  I was also asked to do customer service when they needed help with the phones.
good,Good Benefits and family friendly workplace. Manager care about their employees and what is going on in their lives. Just wish they were located in more areas of the state.
good,My experience was great during my time at Cigna-HealthSpring. I was constantly learning new things everyday. Cigna-HealthSpring makes it a priority to educate and inform all employees of the changes going on around them. I enjoyed my job and also the team I worked with.
good,Provided Administrative Assistant Duties to Insurance Adjusters and answered incoming phone inquiries. Also provided assistance to the Vice President and others.
good,"the last job that I had at Cigna was my favorite one I held of all 13 years. I was laid off along with 50 others due to a department reorganization. "
good,"Team work environment, everyone helps each other out; amazing physicians and staff. Schedule is flexible, if you need a day off of your regular schedule you can ask a co-working if they can cover you so you don't have to use PTO."
good,Assisted a team of sales rep representatives and account managers. They were very easy to work with. The department was very nice and hard working. Nice people to work with.
good,"I enjoyed being a Sr Account Administrator and having a Book of Business.  you had the opportunity to create a positive relationships with both clients and internal colleagues.  I enjoyed being single point of contact and being a Liason."
good,"Flexible hours and good management. Adequate training program for new and existing employees. Benefit and salary are low. Managers are great, supportive and good in communication skills."
good,Depending on your division a typical day at work varies from busy season to slow times. The overall workplace culture is really healthy and supportive and there are plenty of opportunities for self development.
good,"Enjoyed time there lots of opportunity to be creative and have creativity be appreciated. Organisationally top heavy causing high levels of ambiguity and process overlap. My time there was short but certainly could have tolerated being a regular. My boss was one of the most amazing people Ive ever had the pleasure of working with. Unfortunate it had to end. Theres a CEO question at the bottom of this form. I never knew who the CEO was, and when I asked those around me who were regular staffers didnt know either. So while on the one hand the CEO is driving a culture where creativity and entrepreneurial spirit can thrive, the many layers organisationally drives other behaviors."
good,"They make sure that you enjoy your job, Very comfortable work place. Room to grow in the company. Great pay. I worked through a temp service and I was treated like an employee. I was unable to be hired on because I had to call off because of my children, They have a very strict call off policy."
good,"Good pay for easy work, though at times it feels like they would chain you to the desk if it was legal. Like most of my coworkers, and management. However like everywhere there are bad apples."
good,Take calls for information on benefits and claims.  Research and follow-up with issues and claims that need reprocessing after additional information is sent in
good,typical day at work would be answering phones and transferring them to the correct person. There wasn't much time to sit and talk. I learned a lot about disability and how to handle upset customers.
good,"great place to work work balance is great pay is comparable, management that i have had was very hands on deck.  teams that i have worked on were very close knit and respectable"
good,"Plan your own day, you have to have excellent time management  skills.  Your supervisor is a time zone away.  Have to have great communication and problem solving skills (you are on your own on the road). You have to problem solve immediate issues.  the most enjoyable part of the job is the freedom."
good,"There is no limit to where you can go at Cigna. They have a huge customer base. You have access to a massive amount of information. Work environment is very fast paced and number driven.  For a CSA you are required to take over a hundred calls a day. Per quantity you sacrifice quality. Members sometimes have to call several times before getting an issue resolved. However the company as a whole is very well constructed; they offer decent benefits, great PTO and you can easily request time off. One day will feel like it went by in mere minutes."
good,"It has been a very long time since working at Cigna.  When I did work for Cigna, we were in the middle of a major implementation.  While the environment was stressful, the work-life balance was strongly considered and respected by management."
good,Cigna was a good place to work. Working long 10 hours shifts was not great. The pay was really good but the shift hours need to be changed. working until 2am is a stuggle.
good,"From my experience with Cigna Dental, management feels overall company goals  can be met by aiding fellow employees with their ""own"" personal goals in working with the company."
good,"I have enjoyed my time at Cigna, however, after the first year, I knew my job well.  I have been given the opportunity to train others.  Advancing is a bit difficult and the HR department will tell you that you do better quitting, going somewhere else, then coming back to Cigna if you want a salary increase."
good,One of the best companies I worked . Work culture is positive and a growing environment. Opportunities are abundant to grow and its up to the person to use them.
good,"the people workinh here are very kind and very efficient.management is very kind and provided the employees with a lot of benefits,lots of schemes,monthly parties"
good,"I've learned a lot and have been able to see Cigna through multiple views. Overall it is a great company to work for, you can't beat the amount of vacation days they give you and other benefits are not so bad either.(401k, Medical, Dental, Vision, etc.) The hardest part of the job is knowing there isn't anywhere to advance in the company without moving or having upper management create a position for you. The people that I work with everyday are definitely the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Great place to work, had a lot of fun with good colleagues and great teams that helped me learn many new skills which I can apply in future roles, sad to leave."
good,The staff and management were friendly .  The typical day was good working as a health screener for them.  You get to travel quite a bit but you can choose how far you would travel.  Get to meet and alot of people from all aspects of the business world.
good,"Daily file reviews "
good,Supportive atmosphere and great upper management. Opportunities to advance. Day tends to go by fast. Traffic getting to Cigna or leaving can be aggravating at times.
good,I have had a great experience with my job.  If you do what you are suppose to and actually take pride in your work then it is great.  The only downfall is that we have a small team and individuals aren't being held accountable for their own actions.  The benefits of the whole team are being based on everyone's actions and you cant make everyone do their job like they are being paid to do it.
good,"It's a pretty great place, it's a call center, and there is a grand amount of diversity in the employees. The management is always busy, which is good and bad. It means there is a lot of attention to detail within their job that they are taking care of... On the flipside it does limit extensively how much they are able to assist employees with when questions or problems arise. Other than that, not a bad company, and they have a pretty sizeable cafeteria IN the building."
good,A work day is very busy and daily duties must be constantly juggled in order to meet deadlines. All of my co-workers were fantastic and most everyone has the same sense of urgency needed to accomplish important tasks.
good,"Management was very accommodating for personal time requests."
good,"The management is good. "
good,"- journée de travail variée"
good,"Great company! Great benefits, room for advancement. The team I was on was always helpful if anyone had questions. Good to know there are other locations."
good,"Cigna is a good company to work for.  They really care about the well being of their employees.  As with any large corporation, processes move very slowly."
good,I worked as a Nurse Case manager helping customer's get their medication approved by one of our doctors. I enjoyed helping customers get there medications approved and also enjoyed the aspect of working with my colleagues to help the customers with their medication.
good,"I began my employment with Healthspring/Cigna, as a contracted employee. After a few months, I was given a direct hire position. I started and continued as an Inpatient HCC coder/Auditor. I was also fortunate to be included as an auditor for the 2012 HEDIS season. Shortly after, the Inpatient Hospital project was placed on hold. I was transferred to Physician based. I strongly prefer Inpatient Hospital, which led to my leaving and finding the job I currently have"
good,Excellent training and supportive management.  Advances in other areas of the company were available. Friendly co-workers. Was initiated into corporate atmosphere.
good,"Great staff and outstanding providers within this setting.  Room for growth and professional development. In my case, it was a contract position in which I found work-life balance to be not so great as much documentation required completion at home or after hours; however, that is a common finding within many other healthcare/clinical settings.  I would recommend Cigna Living Well Centers to others."
good,"Nice support from Management for work."
good,"Got a chance to work on versatile technologies. Learnt Agile implementation process."
good,laid back work environment. no work/life balance in my department. high traffic site. resourse for professional growth.

good,Good Company. Ive been happy here and have developed my career and skills that I did not have before starting here that I am able to take with me anywhere I may go.
good,The typical work day is pretty chill and relaxing. Sometimes we get a lot of calls where its back to back. Managers are willing to work with you. They actually help their employees. Co-workers are nice and helpful. The hardest part of the job is maybe the calls. We get calls about all type of problems and they get a little hard. Also the most fun part of the job is food day. We have food day like every month where people bring their own food from home.
good,CignaHealthSpring is a great place to work and the benefits is awesome. There's a lot of work to do.  I like working for Cigna HealthSpring.
good,The staff and management where the best. Everyone was always wiling to help. I got to take many classes and trainings. Management was always supportive. The work day always went by quick and you enjoyed your day.

good,"In my time at Cigna, in the Specialty Department, there is plenty of room for advancement. The team they have built is the best in the business. My manager is one of the best that I have ever worked with and is very involved in your career development.

good,Financial Development Program is great! I learnt about Pricing in global markets. My co workers were actuaries and very smart people.

good,The Insurance customer service industry has always been a great source of inbound calls from members who want to check on their claims and/or claims that required adjudication through pharmacy providers.
good,"I was required to pay up to 100 medical claims a day with no monetary errors. I became familiar with ICD-9 codes and CPT codes. My coworkers were all women, we were young and most were newly married and having children or in the process of pregnancy. We were friendly and enjoyed pot lock lunches and celebrating birthdays, etc. I enjoyed having several companies that I was responsible for their specific insurance policies and providing policy holders with their particular policy coverage. I enjoyed teaching the new recruits and making sure their quota was met and done correctly."
good,Cigna is an excellent company to work for as a technical worker.  The company rewards top performers with more opportunities.
good,Great place to work.  Hours are great and set a nice work/life balance.
good,"Good place to work in. Flexible hours, and fast pace environment with a very friendly atmosphere."
good,Good place to work but needs to really work when you work. you will really enjoy working there if you get a good manager.
good,A typical day consisted of 8 hour work shifts with two 15 minute breaks and one 30 minute lunch break. Work days went by fairly quickly due to the nature of the job. I was a mail sorter so it was very repetitive motions and always had a partner or two to work with which made work go by quicker. I got to use my knowledge of lean manufacturing to make my working environment much simpler while always staying busy. The supervisor was very professional and educated when it came to his job but sometimes could be rude and insulting which was reasonable given that he was a supervisor for young adults who liked to stand around and goof off with the other co-workers. The hardest part of the job was probably just the repetitive motion of catching mail since it put so much strain on your back with all the bending motion. The most enjoyable part had to be working with friends from high school who I got along with and helped make time pass without any added stress or boredom.
good,Contracting with physicians and hospitals. Developed system strategic guidelines to implement the Maryland Hospital funding Project.
good,A typical day at work consist of receiving employee data from Sales Reps to input demographic information to produce insurance rates for presentation for companies. The hardest part of my job was the production environment which made for a lot of competition and favoristism. However the most enjoyable part was my keystroke skills advance far more than I ever expected.
good,"Answered inbound calls from dental offices, and members that obtained cigna insurance. Answered questions in regards to the members plan, such as how the frequency of their benefits worked. Explained claims, and quoted a breakdown of benefits. My co workers stayed to themselves in their on private cubicles. We couldn't really converse often. The hardest part of my job would've been learning how to navigate through the different systems, and retaining the information needed to better help my caller."
good,"I can honestly say that this place goes by the book.  At least my manager does.  I appreciate that.  I know that I can come to work and perform my duties and not worry about if my manager likes me or not.  Every position I've moved to, has been because of my performance."
good,Would be coming in working on claim projects that had been processed incorrectly and would have to reach out to customer to discuss problems. Then would obtain examples and then perform an root cause and analysis to resolve issue.  While employed at this organization I learned to process claims which helped me to further advance my career into the Provider Relations Department.
good,It was one of the most challenging positions I've ever held and enjoyed going to work everyday.

good,"Lo mejor y mas positivo, la buena relación entre empleados de diferentes paises y culturas, todos mezclados en la sede europea."

good,I loved the job with always kept me challenged. The culture was great and the management was always allowing you to improve yourself. I would like to see better chance to move within the company. The people within the company are amazing to work with!
good,"While the ability to grow with the company is over stated, they did take great care in training and working with employees on strengths and opportunities."
good,"Good management and support, Great pay and benefits. Worked in a difficult often hostile environment and was supported all the way"
good,"I enjoyed my employment with Cigna, however, a better employment opportunity was offered from another company. My typical day as a Cigna Employee was very busy and productive. I was the Supervisor of a unit of 20 plus employees that processed medical claims for different employer groups insured through Cigna HealthCare. The job was not hard, it was an enjoyable work experience."
good,My shift was 10-7 and I was supporting Cigna customers and employees with technical issues. I was hired as a contractor for a project involving IE8. A couple months later I was hired on. I worked in two departments.
good,I worked for a claims customer service department that specialized in Mental Health and Substance Abuse. It was intense and not for everyone. After almost 4 years it was time for a change and without a degree in Medical you could not really advance
good,I really enjoyed 6years spent in CIGNA.It was really nice working with such client.Manager and coworkers were very cooperative and helpful
good,Worked there for 12 years; progressed pretty well. Reorganizations are always tough because people are bound to lose their job.
good,Cigna Health Care of Florida was definitely a company that offered their clientele quality care as well as optimal customer satisfaction. The services between the insureds as well as the the medical providers created a very successful business relationship. There training was in a very comfortable yet professional.

good,"Interesting projects, management is good to work with, great culture, company is socially responsible and genuinely interested in the health and wellness of their clients."
good,"Cigna is a great place to work overall. I did not honestly know that I would be in the call center when I applied (should have read description a bit more) . And though Call isn't my ""nitch"", it gives me opportunity to see so the front of many sides of Cigna. I do however wish that there was more focus on you as an employee and what YOU'RE actually good at and have management help steer you in that direction. Regardless of your personal skills, it's hard posting out of call once you're in. Sometimes you feel as though the management would allow you to fail before moving you to a department that you'd have more validity in for their own benefit."
good,"Manager respected me, allowed me to make own claims decisions.  Available when I needed to discuss a claim with him.  Encouraging, work-life balance was acknowledged."
good,Great place to work. Casual dress for your day dress code. Management has great open door policy. Career advancement and training are supported and encouraged.

good,Worked for Cigna for over 10 years. Gained lots of experience and worked with a lot of great people. Unfortunately our book of business was moved to India.

good,"Cigna is a solid company that is trustworthy. I highly recommend them as an employer.  The only thing that may be lacking is training and support.  Otherwise, this is a great place to work."
good,I was very young when I got this job and it taught me a lot about being in the corporate environment which I will always be grateful for as it helped me grow as a young professional.

good,"I was a contractor but really enjoyed my position as an Underwriter. I was off the phones which helped me concentrate. Overall, it was a great experience."

good,"Productive and fun place to work depending on the manager"
good,I have enjoyed my time at Cigna. They allow for a good work/life balance. They have a good culture and everyone is working towards the same goal. Management can be inconsistent at times but depends on what department you are in. Job security is high and rarely see high turnover rates. Overall a good company to work for

good,"I've been with this company since 2014 and wish I could've work remotely. I had to leave because of personal reasons but the company is a great place to work for.

good,During my time at the company there were several job eliminations and you did not know when they would happen so working in a tense environment was very challenging.
good,"The people i worked with at Cigna Healthspring were all top notch people. great managers, awesome environment. 99% of my time i worked from home but did have a temp period in which i worked in the office as well and the people were great. The lack of training and only learning things by getting written up for them however left a lot to be desired. I don't fancy being written up and reprimanded for something i was never actually trained on. If i do wrong and i've been trained, write me up, that is fair. That however was not the case. I still maintain it was an awesome place to work though even given those circumstances."
good,"When I worked at CIGNA in the early- to mid-2000s, the only real career growth opportunities existed in the Bloomfield campus. However, the work was engaging and interesting and I was able to build many relationships both in the corporate office and at the various regional offices in my role."

good,"From the top down, you are informed about the mission and current programs that the company is focused on.  At least quarterly company-wide town hall meetings are held. "
good,The best thing about Cigna was the work/life balance and ability to have a somewhat flexible schedule. I really appreciated their concern and interest in families and their employees home life needs.
good,"Was rewarding to assist the customers and resolve their issues/"
good,All the Cigna clinics I worked at have been since closed. There should be an option to skip reviews when companies are no longer operating or it's been so long you have no idea what the current culture or management are like
good,I really enjoyed working at Cigna.  It was rather far but the ride was well worth the wage.  The environment was  relaxed and there is plenty room to grow.
good,"Cigna allowed autonomy  in the work place. I think it it enhances production and innovative thinking."
good,"In my customer service roles the management has been what you would expect it to be. ""Butts in seats"" was their unofficial motto. However once I left the CSR role and moved to account installation everything was way more relaxed. The main problem in this company are the baby-boomers who are so entrenched in the positions they have had for the past 30 years are terrified of losing them so they fear change. Management knows they cant survive without them so they do nothing about the overbearing and hostile attitude towards a  younger, more motivated workforce."
good,"I loved working for CIGNA from home.  I was able to be with my small son till he was ready for school.  I moved up quickly and they saw my potential and acknowledged it. I think I moved up to fast and it may have been a detriment to my job.  But overall, I wish I could work for a great company like this again!"
good,A typical day at work was assisting members with finding out how much they had to pay for a service in the USA or abroad. I learned to maintain my time going from system to system to collect the correct information. Management was helpful. The hardest part of the job was learning the different systems that the company uses. I the most enjoyable part about the job was helping the members.
good,Cigna was a nice place to work. The cafeteria was def nice as well. The management was nice they want you to succeed. All benefits started day 1. Very chill work evnviorment.
good,"A typical day at Cigna, maintaining your production, staying focus on the workload and being able to adapt to sudden changes."
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced, many things to do but limited in time to do them.  Management has been changing a lot in the last year but have a good supervisor.  The hardest part of the job would be keeping up with change.  Most enjoyable part is the people I work with."
good,"The day to day is taking call and making calls, going over the assessments for customers and patients. Depending on the result of the assessments will determine the next step of the calls. A call can take 15 min up to an hr."
good,This was a mail order environment.  It was an extremely competitive environment where each pharmacist was compared to one another. Each queue that was worked on by the pharmacist was evaluated by the computer an timed.

The building is beautiful and there is plenty of parking and by a state park which was perfect for our company picnic and fall festival.  Although I had a large load of work to accomplish, I was able to balance all of them to keep from getting overwhelmed. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with all the e-mails.

Time management is also a huge key. I enjoyed conversations with claimants in order to build a case for disability and ultimately approve or deny. We had a number of coaches and Sr reps helping us. It really does take up to 18mos to totally understand and to obtain a regular flow of your daily duties. I just thought it odd, that the ""legal dept"" would not approve certain items for training purposes leaving most of us bewildered, when told to create your own process/procedure for doing your job, as the trainer nor tenured reps are not allowed to share theirs...ok. My co-workers were a good group of people."

I learned a lot as to what an election period is and what a special election period means. The management staff is top notched and provided excellent training and support. The work environment is family oriented and I got along well with my co-workers. If anyone had a scheduling problem we would work it out among ourselves without any help from management. The hardest thing about my job was receiving calls from people I could not help. I got the most reward out of putting someone into a health insurance plan they benefited from and saved money on at the same time."

The most enjoyable part of the job was when I was able to resolve customers' issues and help answer co-workers' questions."

I perfected my management skills which included coaching, training, and supporting my team. My management team included three other managers and we worked closely to make sure the whole department ran as a team, cross training and supporting each other. The challenge was to build the team up to 45 employees and then laying all off when the business transferred to Phoenix. I really like to manage a successful team and love to see all grow into their strengths."
good,Answering phone calls regarding insurance policies/claims.
good,"The hardest part of the job: Less team building activity"

good,"Cigna bought out Great-West Healthcare, so the environment prior to leaving was cautious. People were walking on eggshells not knowing exactly what to expect as in job security. On the whole, I loved the people and the environment before Cigna bought us. I believe that Cigna is a good company and that moral will improve over time. It is hard after a buyout though as you do not know what to expect and you hope your job is safe."

Next, meeting with nurses to decide if claims could be resolved or needed further review by a doctor.  I regularly contacted clients to keep them up to date with their claim status, and assisted them with applying for Social Security Disability, a common claim offset.  Managers were always available to help, or give a second look at a difficult case.  The hardest part of the job was telling clients we had to deny their claim. Depending on their employer's policy, many were subjected to pre-existing condition clauses. I most enjoyed working with my team members, and being available for clients. I felt like a valued member of my team. Sometimes a client or spouse just needed someone to talk to. "

We had flexible hours which started at 5 a.m. and clock out time was 1 p.m. but when you come in at 5 a.m. and then have to do mandatory overtime that is rough so some people like myself just did the overtime on Saturdays or Sundays. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I was approved to work from home!!!!
good,"lots of flexibility in sales department, learned a lot about how to work autonomously as well as with a team. The hardest part of the job is the workload and lack of resources to get your job done. The people at Cigna were great to work with and made you feel you were all on the same team."
good,It's a great company to work for and love the idea you could purchase  additional vacation time if needed. Works well with family life an balance and was happy to work for them.
good,"I started out sorting incoming claims. I had to determine if they were tier 1, tier 2 or hospital claims and verify the patient information & coverage before the claims were taken up stairs to be processed. After I had been here three months a position opened up as a claims processor. I applied & was accepted into the training class. I made it through the class & went to the processing floor but soon discovered it was not for me. I was allowed to return to my previous position and that is where I stayed until I had to leave."
good,"This was an enjoyable experience working at Cigna Healthcare. This was a call center and was a fast-paced working experience."
good,working there was very fun and gave me the opportunity to learn a lot. I worked for a temp agency and the hiring on took over a year so I unfortunately had to leave.
good,"Cigna is a great company to work for. Flexible schedules, knowledgeable and understanding managers.  Great training program for new hires.  Offers a competitive wage in today's market and provides annual raises to their employees who are meeting and exceeding their metrics."
good,"My day would start in a very friendly place. I learned enough about this industry that I could work at another place of this nature if given a chance. Management was very family oriented, we would talk with each other co-workers as well without having that managment title be a barrier between us. I think the hardest part of the job was keeping up with the quota of applications you had to do to keep your job. I feel that if you are doing your best this should be taken into consideration and the fact that you need your job, if you are the sole bread winner of the family. "
good,"Work environment was that of a Call Center.  Customer Service Representatives were expected to take customer calls with a smile about 7.5 hours per day.  I have learned much about medicare advantage plans, and about the Health Insurance Portability and Affordability Act (HIPAA).  During my time as a customer service representative I had to verify four pieces of HIPAA information to help ensure and protect customer's personal information. I have found that in a call center environment that communication  with co-workers was hard but not impossible.  Communication was done through instant messaging.  The most enjoyable part of a customer service representative was dealing with the customers and providing them with the correct information regarding their medicare advantage plans."
good,"Great training, nice people, team oriented, easy going management, regular evaluations, fun culture, flexiblity in work hours, lots of paid time off."

good,"Years of employment at CIGNA were enjoyable.  Pleasant environment, managers and co-worker's were great to work with.  Many opportunities given to the employees to learn and advance with department/company."
good,I believe I learned a lot working as an assistant phlebotomist in Cigna Arizona. In a typical work day I learned how to draw blood from several patients and to perform urine and stool analysis and that was exciting for me. I woke up every day looking forward to learning about the clinic environment and improving my skills.
good,"Good company to work for, maybe not for the long term though. Management team usually pretty entry level, compensation sometimes makes you feel unappreciated."
good,"•"
good,Due to being a temporary contract worker no benefits or stability given.  The workplace is clean but the air quality needs to be filtered because employees were always getting sick.
good,I had only assisted Cigna with 3 flu different flu shot clinic events in i believe 2007.It is very difficult for me to even attempt to rate this company.
good,The amount of stress I have had within the last 90 days has been determentaial to my health and sanity. Calls are excessive and they do not STOP.  I had high expectations for Cigna and the fact that I waited so long to be apart of the team I am disappointed. The turnover rate is so high. People are dropping like flies because the metrics and unreasonable and attendance policy does not allow you to manage your life and work properly. I love the people I work with though. CCAs need to get paid at least $50K for the amount of stress we deal with.
good,"very good management and team, I am missing them.

Telephone work dealing with customers and brokers, direct debits, card payments, complaints, spreadsheets and different aspects of insurance were all in a days work and ensured team members received excellent training on all aspects of the role."
good,"CIGNA Dental offers great savings on preventive, basic and major treatments. However, they tend to be on the costlier side so it's a good idea to check for other available packages. Premiums and plans are subject to your location."

good,"The one advantage working for Cigna is they do offer a competitive wage for the type of work you perform.  However they have much to learn about the difference in their diversity and inclusion areas.

It was stressful but I exceeded. There was also a lot of changes in the way the job was done from week to week sometimes day to day. I took pride in being adaptable to changing so quickly and remembering the changes. There was a lot of research needed to solve a claim and many applications to learn to effectively to be able to process the claim. I enjoyed working independently to get the job done. I worked along side of some incredible people. I learned to always be open to learning new things and other department areas of the company.

good,"I loved the diversity that the job offered and would continue with health coaching, but due to the fact that the jobs assignments are based on open enrollment, the job did not offer consistent assignments. I currently work for six biometric companies and still cannot maintain full-time hours, which I need. My typical day at work involved one of three stations. I would be assigned to doing the bloodwork that consisted of a lipid panel, glucose, PSA, and TSH. Another station would be doing the actual measurements, which included, ht, wt, % of body fat utilizing either the tanita scale and waist circumference or I would be assigned as a health coach which consisted of a three-five minute coaching session to review the results and make recommendations to maintain their current numbers or ways to make improvements."
good,I enjoy working with different teams of people. I like that our equipment is shipped to the companies. This provides quicker set up and tear down. Everything has to go back into boxes that it came from. So at every event we know where to find things. Hard part is moving up in the company.

good,Huge company in the US not so big in Europe this limits everything.
good,"You have to be in the right department/position and you'll really be pushed and challenged to grow. You have to be a self-starter and self-learner in order to flourish at Cigna because the training isn't always great - but if you're resourceful, you can find the information you need."
good,"the best part about working at cigna was work at home, break whenever you wanted, no phones calls, great pay, good insurance. learn different things about appeals"
good,I had a temporary assignment and my supervisor started a week after me.   She was not a good supervisor but that was the only bad thing about the company.   The environment was supportive upper management was great.   Great place to work especially if you are in the Health field.  I was hired to help get the division I  worked for out of Sanction.  I would read complaints and try to resolve the issue if unable to resolve the issue myself I would have to send it to another office to determine if they could resolve the issue or answer a question that prevented me from resolving the issue.  The hardest part of the job was interviewing clients with mental issues sometimes it became a little off color and the best part of the job helping resolving a disgruntled client resolve their issue with 100% satisfaction.
good,"Great people, answered phones and assisted callers with general refills of their medications.  Had the advancement to work up into specialty medication sales that you really have to pay attention to detail to."
good,I work from home so I do not interact with my associates. Typical day is logging on and carrying out my duties until it is time for me to lo off. Management could be better.
good,"Great co-workers and trainers. Sadly job security is not at all % guaranteed. Great opportunities to grow, however will take you quite sometime to get there."
good,This job is very productive and helpful. And will also help the agents to enhance their ability for the job. co-workers a very warm and helpful. Good management.
good,"Enjoyed working for the Company, able to set up a customer service center with only three employees- Learned how to quote and issue flood polies. Our immediate manager was based in CA, the hardest part of the job was not having training on how to handle massive phone calls in a day."
good,"You will be driven to define excellence by keeping your customer at the center of your focus and aligning all your tasks towards that end."
good,"The work schedule is flexible, you get to work independently, as long as you understand the concept, the system needs to be updated to ensure there aren't delays in processing"
good,"Great place to work I love this company, its one of the best places I've worked so far. just kinda disapponted that the [roduction floor where I worked closed."
good,"The last position worked was reviewing prior authorization request for non formulary medication that were not typically covered or had restrictions on the medications. Review the request from the doctors office via fax.  Approve is able, if not able to approve, send to pharmachist for clinical review."
good,"great place to work,company was well organized and valued their customers and the customers concerns. as well as a speedy turn around on getting customers their prescriptions"
good,I have a team of agents that worked really hard and it showed in their numbers daily.  We enjoyed being together as a family and taking care of each other.
good,"CIGNA has excellent IT & QA divisions complete with training and cross-training. Multiple meeting with various groups prior to writing specs, developing test scripts, and script execution."
good,"Training and testing software"
good,"great company to work for,met a lot of nice hard working people"
good,I have learned many new things at my job. I love helping people and making my members happy. The hardest part of the job is trying to make ALL of my members happy. My co-workers are awsome and the management is very helpful.
good,I really enjoyed working at cigna. The people were wonderful.
good,I enjoyed working there. Good work environment. They offered excellent benefits and pay. Good people to work with. Always chance of advancement to other depts.
good,"I worked for the company for more than 20 years. I have some college courses, but no degree. I was able to work my way up in the company and gain valuable knowledge and skills to prepare me for jobs in other companies. The interview process is tough, but the overall benefits to career are pretty great. The ability to set your own work schedule was priceless!"
good,Cigna has alot of benefits . working from home is a huge plus. Pay is not very competitive. They are lot of job openeings but its very big on who you know.
good,I love working for Cigna. I've leard a lot about Prior Authorization and Tier 1-4 once you learned your role its so relaxing. I love my cubicle I had my own space but other were there when I needed help.
good,"I had 2 iterations as an IT contractor for Cigna at the Philadelphia, PA office and the experience was very good. Great colleagues, flexibility with initiative are greatly encouraged."
good,This was a great company with great benefits. The managers were always good with communicating and the incentive programs offered to their employees was amazing.
good,"Opportunities to learn new thing, provides coaching in  difficult situations. Workplace culture is good. Quick response to emails."
good,"I enjoyed what I did, always kept busy and had opportunities to learn what other departments did, also enjoyed working in a very large company where I could be around people."
good,I learned the position and kept my career on path to where I saw myself going. I was able to pick up a tremendous amount of knowledge in the two years I was in the office and I then moved to another position inside the company
good,A great place to work with great people to work with  there is a relaxed atmosphere location is great  and also great pay and wonderful management. I would recommend Cigna to anyone who is willing to work hard and enjoy themselves there.
good,"Full support Team Work but Management not supported any issue "
good,I was hired for a project to remove my department from the Sanction they were under when I was hired.  The work was fast paced and the hours were long.  Sometimes we were required to work 7 days 10 hour days with short notice.  However they paid well and the trainers were great. However the upper management was clueless to the satellite offices and the challenges they faced. Good company to work for if you are the medical field and wish to go into upper management not so for entry level positions.  Very high turnover rate.
good,"I would definitely recommend this position, as long as you don't mind a lot of hours that need to be put in to have the needed success to renew each client at their renewal.  Thank you"
good,"Respectful of each departments roles, team environment.  Can be stressful during 4th quarter, but you usually have the resources you need.  Relying on your teammates and them on you is key to succeeding.  Most of Cigna's managers behave in a professional manner, though there have been a few that needed some handling by HR.  Overall it's a great place to work."
good,"In this position, I had my own cases.  I would set up a group from scratch, load COBRA members and process the day to day mail and answer the phones.  Dealt very closely with the client and COBRA members alike.  Loaded the yearly COBRA rates and kept the systems updated with the members eligibility so they could get services.  The hardest part of the job was when we were told they were outsourcing the COBRA function and we would all lose our jobs.  That was a very sad day as I really enjoyed my job.  The best part of the job was and still is, my friends I met along the way.  We still remain close and meet up for dinner once a month to catch up."
good,There is a lot of work and a lot of great innovations underway.  It was an exciting place to work but there was a lot of work to do and it was difficult to do it in a part-time capacity.
good,"The working environment was good, but some employees got away with things that we weren't suppose to do, and they didn't like that I called them on certain things, I'm upfront and direct"
good,Good work environment. Employees were nice. I was able to work at home three days a week. The commute to center city was not bad on the train from where I lived.
good,"It's a great company for young adults; opportunity to advance if you truly seek advancement. The company offer medical, dental, vision and 401k upon hire."
good,Working at Cigna is what you make of it.  It can be great or it can be challenging.  Managers are great if you are upfront about any challenges or difficulty.
good,"My daily routine here at work is very easy going. i clock in and im on ready. I take inbound calls. The costumers that call in to report time, file a claim due to being out for a surgery, illness, pregnancy, or for a family member. This working environment is very comfortable and welcoming. the people here help you so much, and make you feel you want to be at work. Everyone here gets along. They make sure they dont see you failing or struggling. Their always here to help!"
good,They are are open to working remotely which makes it convenient for those outside of an office area and makes it effective to work without being micro managed. The company is big and changes occur very slowly.
good,Cigna Re-insurance is a low stress place to work.  Unfortunately it is also a group that organizational very flat.  Thus the possibility of advancement is quite low.  The group itself is more like a family and is less ridge in structure
good,"Double Standards and no communication. decent pay, need a lot of internal help for moving up within company.Chances are slim, but they are available."
good,"We only had 2 staff members me the Medial Assistant and the Provider with only 1 exam room.  Made for things to be a bit hectic some days being so short staffed and not equipped with items we needed to provide for our patients.  But in the end it all worked out, my provider and I had wonderful working relationship."
good,My time at Cigna was great but management was not good. Overall good place to advance. Alot of cliques.No opportunity for overtime  and always selected by management.
good,Lots to learn but with the help of a great team you are able to do it. sales was hard and the quote you have to meet is crazy. many of people have been let go because of it. the management was is the worst.
good,"Productive work place that cares about their employees. There have been a few transitions over the past few years, and they haven't always gone smoothly, but upper management has had our backs to make sure we've had some security in our jobs."
good,Cigna overall is a great place to work. Benefits and salary are competitive and the culture is good. I would recommend them to a friend.
good,I was with CIGNA for 10 years. I had multiple position advancements.. The job was very rewarding and advanced my technology skills
good,"I worked in a call center answering insurance inquiries. "
good,Great company! Just looking to advance myself and find a position more in line with my academic achievements.

good,"* Nothing like typical"
good,Travel to various Primary Care Providers and review charts to ensure health measures being met.
good,"I started with Healthspring almost 8 years ago. I moved back to Tennessee to care for my mother, who was ill and passed away. I Love Healthspring. This company was such a warm, caring, loving organization! I can't say enough nice things about it. The year of 2010, when we flooded and made history, my husband also died that same week. members and staff were flooded out. Our head powers that be waded in chest high water to help members and staff. They worked tirelessly to assist everyone in need. They were always appreciative of the hard work of the employees. And we all worked hard because we loved and believed in our company and its mission. I have been an Ambassador for Healthspring everywhere I went and all I met. I loved the company so! Since being bought by Cigna, there have been major changes, as obviously happens in a major acquisition. I think sometimes when you become so big, the little things that mean so much tend to disappear just because that is the nature of a giant corporation. Change is hard for everybody. I need to feel like I make a difference in the community and the world through my work as well as personal life. There are many ways Cigna does this very thing. But they are global. "
good,"Come in to work, get situated (get coffee and/or breakfast), start assignment (if any), took breaks at leisure (2-15 mins, 30 mins/1 hour for lunch).  Hardly had a bad day unless no work was available.  Worked with Excel Mostly which was very informative for me.  Learned how to submit prescription claims and tested trial claims.  Supervisor was very professional and never minded answering questions if there were any.  Co-workers were respectable but to themselves mostly.  Hardest part of the job for me was sitting with nothing to do.  I am a hands on person and like to be busy.  Most enjoyable part of the job was not having to be micro managed."
good,"The job was great, and the company put its employees first. I was and independent contractor for the company. And it was great, traveled to different cities for work."
good,"It was a great company to work for.  I learned a lot about the different claims, and a lot of insurance.  However, I'm a very outgoing person, and just couldn't be able to sit for 8+ hours doing the same thing.  I like to keep and stay busy."
good,"great place to work"
good,"I have enjoy working at Cigna but they are outsourcing my department and will be out of work as on October 1, 2013"
good,"A typical work day would have been answering inbound telephone calls about benefits, eligibility, claim payment and other questions generated by member, providers and other employees. I learned that healthcare is very complicated and detail oriented. Coworkers were awesome to work with as friendships were developed and last for a long time. Hardest part of the job dealing with angry people over simple things. Most enjoyable parrt of the job was making people happy with resolving the issues."
good,"We have a typical busy working days from Monday thru Friday. If necessary even Saturday. Open overtime for us in claim operations department. Though stressful working more than 8 hours in a day, still we're proud and happy meeting our deadlines for daily incoming mail, subpoena request from member/s, retrieval of documents, batching, scanning and indexing of documents."

good,Learned a lot of compliance methods used in order to comply to the UAE regulations. Group renewals are made so much more easier.Customer satisfaction is a top priority in this company.

good,"Cinga is a great place to work provides tools in which you can grow and become successful. Cinga is a place that will allow you to grow, cinga is very big on giving back to the community"
good,"Cigna is a great place to work."
good,I enjoyed my temporary assignment at Cigna.  The atmosphere seemed very positive and upbeat.  Loved the cafeteria and the option to eat outside when it was nice out.  Temps do not get the same benefits as permanent employees such as use of some of the facilities there.  I would have loved to continue on my employment there but could not find a job that I was qualified for.  I will try to apply again once I find something that I feel would be a good fit.
good,I came from a long history in hospital life. It’s nice to work for a company that isn’t constantly talking about “ not enough revenue”. I enjoy the company and the opportunity to work from home.
good,"The work environment is very productive their very Team oriented , the customer service is wonderful. They believe in resolving issue or problems always friendly"
good,Great work environment with plenty of options to advance your career. Very good on the job training with plenty of opportunities to cross train and explore new roles.

good,This was a great place to work. i enjoyed the staff and management. It was a nice team work environment and it was a great experience. i just wish they kept some of their temps that they get from the agencies.
good,Customer centric company making strides to capture market share in the insurance industry.  Many opportunities to grow with the company.  Very competitive.
good,"I have no comments regarding workplace culture or what part i the hardest or most enjoyable part of the job.I have not worked there in a very, vey long time."
good,"Plugged into a phone  call center environment.  Taking call after call from customer's, doctor offices, hospital's and benefit administrators regarding benefit coverage's, hospital admins, and nurse assistance requests."
good,The company has great values and a CEO that is very passionate about the organization.  Advancement opportunities was difficult unless you moved to another location.
good,I absolutely loved working for this company. having he ability to telecommute and manage my own schedule was fantastic. The hardest part of the job was my direct report was not local.
good,"A typical day at work would be setting up systems and logging on ready to take inbound calls from customers wanting to set up travel insurance policies. The hardest part of my job is having to say to a customer that we cant cover for the medical condition. The most enjoyable is speaking to new people every day, keeping the role interesting."
good,"friendly and helpful environment, there are great programs that offer employees to receive discounts for child care. The hardest part  would be the drive due to being located around the Galleria"
good,"Great place to work, great pay, great benefits. The management is knowledgeable, accessible, and fair. I would definitely recommend this company to others."
good,"I enjoyed working at Cigna. I learned and collaborated with very professional people. Co-workers were very helpful in the beginning of my role there and were always very accessible to help and answer questions, excellent workplace culture."
good,"Temporary position, hired though a staffing agency vs. Cigna itself.  However, from what I could tell, I would've loved to (still would!) work for Cigna itself.  Cigna employees seem to get great benefits, and the buildings themselves are fairly new and cleanly- a generally nice environment to be in.  They even have an on site Starbucks!  But that was in a different location than the building I worked in, so I never went.  However, even the little cafe downstairs in the building I was in served warm fresh Starbucks brews (Can you tell coffee is important to me yet?) lol."
good,I loved working there.  Positive people all around. Manager was very understanding. Training was great and easy to do. Accommodated your personal life.
good,Overall Cigna is a great company that promotes a great work culture and heath and wellness for its employees. There is a lot of advancement opportunities
good,"Work 8 hour days;  available to work on projects as needed, which I am currently doing; my work has been temporarily assigned to someone else.  The most difficult part of my day is making sure that my coworkers feel valued and contribute to company goals. The most enjoyable part of my day is the work and on occasion having something funny or silly to happen."
good,"Good Job, good management, quick  paced environment.Everything is timed , Lunches,breaks, bathroom breaks, phone calls taken phone calls out, time taken to assist customer and then averaged out to a percentage that will be reviewed every day and then every week and ultimately for every month. Also phone calls are recorded someone is responsible to listen to your quality and if you give out incorrect information you will know. Management will make sure you know your mistakes so you can learn from them. Some great managers and teachers. Friendly Staff. The company as a whole has a bad reputation( but the people who work at Cigna are great, they work the best with what they have. If medical insurance is something you are interested in this is a great job. If sitting all day and being monitored to the T is not for you this job is not for you."
good,I worked here in 1998 but then it was a great company to work for.  There were many opportunities for advancement.  Management was great and fair.  There wee many oppourtunies for rewards and bonuses
good,My typical day of work has to be as accurate as possible. I learned how to look at different  codes that represent difference service. My supervisor was super nice and always there to help.
good,I have a very full day.  The culture in my department is great and conducive to family.  The most enjoyable part is coming in in the morning to a great tam with positive attitudes.  I learned that hard work and perseverance does pay off.
good,You are allowed to basically set your own schedule. Possibly work part of the time from home. Great atmosphere and the people that work there are awesome!

good,"I enjoy the work place culture of working with Cigna because, I enjoy my co-workers. I enjoy the job, I have no cons with it. I like my work schedule. Every Monday over time is mandatory but that is not a inconvenience. The hardest part of the job is that its difficult to schedule days off. I enjoy the job overall"
good,"Autonomy, friendly staff, quality care.  Innovation based organization.  Provides ongoing education with a tremendous amount of resources and great company benefits."
good,Very good experience in this company very good bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb

good,"Good pay, flexible hours, friendly staff."
good,"Very good place to work, nice members and good work flow. Sometimes to much down time.Provide excellent customer service while helping manage the fitness center and writing exercise prescriptions for the members. Also, would hold group fitness trainings for 3-4 members at a time, performed exercise testing/assessment, and cleaned/maintained the fitness center."
good,Frequent changes which at times can be frustrating but at the core there is consistency in values and ability to progress.
good,"Being on the support team can be hectic.  However, I am blessed to have teams who respect me and appreciate all I do for them.  I love my manager.  She is very flexible with our schedules.  Overall, everyone is very nice and the job, although very strenuous, is a lot of fun."
good,Management is great. Coworkers were wonderful. Work day was very predictable. Everyone remained accountable to work load. Work life balance is number one.

good,Cigna is a great place to work. Cigna offers great benefits.
good,Cigna is a very large company which has a different culture at each location. Overall it's a great company to work for if you're looking for pay and benefits only. As far as professional development goes it scores average.
good,"Call center environment, answered all incoming calls speaking with providers and policy holders regarding benefits and claims. Provided excellent customer service, utilized all resource materials to provide quality responses to customer inquiries. What i learned was healthcare benefits, and medical terminology. Management was great, my co workers were friendly. The hardest part of the job was being monitored on all calls, having to open and close all calls in a timely manner and getting feedback on your performance.

good,Working for CIGNA was a great experience for someone looking to fully understand the medical insurance industry. Gave me great experience and skills to apply toward other challenges.
good,Great place to work. Employee friendly and never a dull moment.
good,"Cigna's was a great opportunity and a very good work environment. They are helpful in every way possible and are always there to push you forward and excel. They compensate greatly, and hey what beats weekly pay."

good,Great place to work. Good work life balance. Good benefit package and decent pay for work that you do. Educational reimbursement available and advancement opportunities.
good,Work at home is very beneficial option if offered. Many advancement opportunities within. Campus facilities are very up to date and convenient.  On site NP and cafeteria and gym.
good,"Really enjoy working here. Currently contract worker hoping for an extension. Limited permanent job openings, so very competitive. Staff is very friendly and helpful."
good,Great place to work. Good work life balance. Medical benefits could improve in terms of costs. Pay is not very competitive. Very hard to move to more challenging roles. Slow pace compared to other insurance companies.
good,I enjoy the opportunity to work from home most of the week. My manager is very helpful and understanding. I have the flexibility of creating my own schedule.
good,This company understands the true meaning of work-life balance. Great pay and willing to teach you along the way. Tons of opportunity within this organization.
good,Work from home availability. Generous PTO and educational reimbursement program. Benefits are better than a lot of places. My department has great managers who are flexible and will work with you to help in any way that they can.
good,"I worked here since i was a teen to my late 20's. They dont' really promote people of color. They literally have the minimum necessary to fill their affirmative action quota. The time off is great, benefits could be better. 401K was the best."
good,This was a good job and I wish I were still there. I worked in community outreach and loved it with all my heart. The manager was amazing and so where my coworkers. I miss it and wish I could go back did I say that already? LOL
good,A great company to work for. Offer great benefits. Management is fair. Compensation is fair. Health benefits are too expensive. Change the deductibles.
good,"Great workplace with mission, environment, and staff to match. The customer is placed first and at the forefront of our planning. Employees are afforded the opportunity to continue education or even move up within he company."
good,"While working with customers to process requests for medications was sometimes rewarding, there were sometimes where patients just needed someone to listen to them. Cigna prides themselves with excellent customer service. Cigna was moving in a different direction to improve on services provided. New services were provided for employees in assisting customers. The overtime provided for employees were based on growing clientele and work load. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with system changes or being implemented, but the employees were great to work with."
good,"Cigna provided opportunities to advance and relocate across the country.  They offered a great work/life balance, the benefits and vacation time were generous."

Learning how to prioritize is definitely a necessity!"
good,"Review and answer emails. Check executive calendar for any upcoming meetings, travel, etc. Check the executive inbox/outbox for the day.  Check any incoming mail that need to be responded to. "
good,Cigna is a great place to work! I am currently still there and the company overall gives you lots of opportunity for growth and resources. The CEO is super approachable and set a great tone company wide.
good,As of now we only have enough staff to get by the day.Each employee doing 2-3 roles to survive a busy day. Task is done for the day but there is no time to review patient's chart to find out what else to do to help patient outside of the visit.
good,"Cigna fosters a happy work environment and takes great care of you as an employee via financial compensation, paid time off, somewhat flexible schedules, and having a gym on site (Norterra campus).  Some managers were better than others, I was lucky to have 2 great ones during the 4 years I worked there!  Not everyone got annual bonuses but I was fortunate.  My only qualms were that I was never promoted to team lead and never allowed to work completely at home (I had one week WAH every 5-6 weeks).  What finally lead me to quit was that they started micro-managing hard core.  I needed more autonomy in my life.  They were paying people with Master's degrees to do the jobs of high-school graduates.  I mean, we were getting good money to do it, but it made no sense to me.  When I started in 2011 it was the perfect job.  When I quit in 2015, not so much and my ex-colleagues say it hasn't really changed."
good,"I am currently employed with Cigna and they are a great company to work for. The work life balance of picking four 10 hour days or five 8 hour days is great. There is also opportunity to work remotely 2 of those 4 days. I currently work in disability and it can get stressful at times but nothing really to complain about. If there is anything to complain about, I feel that the medical benefits are not very good. The compensation is fair and paid time off is more than acceptable along with the holidays off."
good,"very fast pace job, places to relax for break, cafeteria, and always some type of function going on for employee appreciation"
good,Worked in an Urgent Care setting. I loved it. Fast paced and ever changing. We took care of all kinds of patients. Our manager was very laid back and didnt micro mange at all. The job could be physically demanding but I loved it. I enjoyed knowing at the end of my shift i did the best I could to help people.
good,"A typical day at work was a nice quiet environment had my own office so came into work did my work and left at the end of the day. I learned a lot about advancing In my keyboarding and company emailing, management was very reasonable and understanding. The hardest part I would have to say about my position was nothing I loved the position I had and all of the training I had within that position. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to have my own office and having my own space."
good,Cigna is amazing with many routes your career can take once you get into the door.  Strong and supportive leadership with a focus on your success. You will be provided with the tools to succeed if you are willing to put out the effort.
good,I have enjoyed my time at Cigna Healthcare and hope to spend more years with this company.  My team is a great group with great direct leadership who understand the needs of our group and help navigate through issues that may arise.
good,great place to work - because I was allowed to work from home!!!! this was a great benefit for the family raising small children.  Management seem to be on hands with the employees.
good,working on over 120 ongoing claims.
good,"Cigna is an excellent place to work, people are willing to help you succeed. They do a great job of providing resources to better employee health. The kids love the annual ""Bring your child to work day"""
good,"The only reason I left was because I had to drive a very long distance and an at home position was not going to be available at that time. However it's a great place to work, you do have a long training period, but it is worth it so that you are knowledgeable once you are on the phones. They held a lot of fun event for employees, one of my favorite parts was a farmer's market that came every other week (on payday). It's something I never experienced in the work place and it was wonderful. "
good,I enjoy working the call center environment at my own pace. It is an nice environment to work. My supervisor is amazing and my co-workers are awesome.

good,"The hardest part for me was learning what data needed to be entered and how.  Most agents had been there before.  I needed to understand the flow and what was tracked in the computer.  I would have liked more training in that area right away.  I enjoyed helping people understand Medicare and how the plans enhanced Medicare."
good,"A typical day would began with pulling payments from a lockbox account and posted to members account. Normally, Calltrackers were assigned. Once assigned Calltrackers are worked until completed. It was a fun place to work and my team members were very hard workers. Our Manager was superb, a good listener, very energetic individual. It was a very fast-paced environment, and I loved it. The hardest part of this job was getting corrected information from other departments in a timely manner.

good,"Cigna provided me so many opportunities to expand my capabilities and skills.  By granting access across multiple internal teams, I was able to understand more of the overall structure of how we offered clients health insurance.  Open to ideas, Cigna allowed me to express how I thought we could better meet employees where they wanted to be met in their health journeys.  Going to work was like meeting up with friends.  Always happy to see friendly faces, bouncing ideas off of eachother was not only welcomed, but encouraged. My Cigna family will always be close to my heart."

good,"would love to do again .I met so many wonderful people, learned another facet of healthcare, and strengthened my resume.

Initially there were some empty cubicles; not all of them put together, phone lines not run, computers not yet installed, filing cabinets not present. Security system non-existent.The VP relied on me to get the office up and running and allowed my input on candidates hired for the various positions including sales manager, receptionist, and public relations supervisor.

good,"At typical day at work is standard office fare."
good,People in the call center industry are approachable and easy to talk to. As everyone is stressed out on the work load everyone is still happy because of the working environment. I enjoy the extra activities in the office like the after shift basketball and the sports fest where you and your team compete with other teams in your company. The only down side of working in a call center industry is that you will have an irregular time of sleeping as the work starts at night as we follow the time in USA.
good,Cigna is an excellent company to work for. The team and manager in my current department is the best. There is room for advancement and they want you to succeed. They offer Cigna University courses to help you advance.

good,"I enjoyed working with files all day because I enjoy organizing files and files. I worked in the file room and cleaned out files, replaced old files, and boxed files that were going to be moved to a new office. The hardest part of the job was probably the tidyness it took while working."
good,This employer is a good company if you can handle the pressure. The training is good. There is always room for advancement and pay to go with it. Co-workers are pretty much helpful but if your not meeting your quotas I find that they don't want to help as much. Benefits are great.

I learned alot in accounting, for example of how much money we were suppose to have, balancing out each person total at the end of the night.

good,"good work environment, team work,class time for educational tools, good pay rate, family oriented environment,learning curve everyday,more responsibilities added to your daily job."
good,I enjoyed working with seniors all day on the phone resolving concerns regarding the Healthsource For Seniors product. I was also instrumental in creating a handbook of resources for the seniors regarding what their insurance did/didn't cover. Hardest part of the job was the seniors not being able to understand or hear me regarding their benefits.
good,"Entered into system doctors, hospitals, and labs names, addresses, and insurance information. Assisted them and field claims offices in any manner. Trained new and old co-workers.

good,This is a perfect call center job because it feels like so much more! Take all the pros from previous call center jobs and roll it all into one and you will have Cigna! The only reason I am leaving my job is to relocate for family reasons! Other than that Cigna would be my place of retirement.
good,I worked in Recruitment. The management set a standard for management that I am sure is unattainable by many others. The management is helpful and willing to assist new employees. The only negative is that it is a small town and there is quite a bit of drama among the young employees.
good,I was one of the first 40 employees hired at Cigna when they moved to Dubuque.  The were trying a new work environment of team work.  Because we were all new it was a great learning experience to solve issues that came up.  Also the advancement of the computer from green screen and codes to window base and e-mail

good,"I worked in one of the sales offices and met some of the nicest people you could hope to work with. Despite the size of the organization, management levels were fairly flat and there was fairly close access to senior management.  Cigna also encourages people to stay at the organization and move internally.  It's still a large corporation though and you need to play by the rules."

good,"I loved working for Cigna HealthSpring, the only drawback is that I live in Murfreesboro and I had to drive to Metro Center. It was a great place to work and most everyone made you feel welcome. I would go back in a heartbeat  but dread the long drive. The management team I had pretty much left you alone as long as you did your job."
good,Cigna is a great company that offers many things from tuition reimbursement program to healthy living program that helps balance your work life and home life.

The enjoyable part of my job was the clients I worked with."
good,We take calls after calls and thats something that i enjoy because it makes the day go by and i like how we get to help people.

good,"I enjoyed working for Cigna in the short time I was there. I took ill and had not been working there long enough to have my position held for me.

Management was low key but always around when needed, my manager didn't micro management but had weekly meeting with every employee regardless of their production level.

I found there were simple words that could be misconstude then what you were actually trying to state and then having to explain yourself when client's basically hold on to every word you are saying because it means the difference on their elgibility thru FMLA, short/long term disability benefits."
