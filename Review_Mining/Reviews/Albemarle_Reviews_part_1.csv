rating,review
bad,"Frequent inane internal policy changes with minimal communication, Frequent gossip and backstabbing by staff AND management. Little to no support by upper management. Very low pay, no employee reviews, someone getting a raise is very rare. I was promoted to asst. Manager without a raise until 6 months later and even then, it was a meager amount."
bad,Albemarle is a company rooted in its history and with no desire to grow from that history.  The company does no benchmarking of its programs or management systems.  Its probably the last company in the world still using Lotus Notes.  Its singular focus on one business unit at the expense of all others has put all its eggs in one basket.
bad,Every single day was full of drama. People there just can’t go to work and go home without causing a fuss. The manager of the Vespa Unit is an idiot and so is two of the supervisors.
bad,Very unappreciative of there employees. I honestly think they can do a lot more in showing there appreciation especially considering all the safe work man hours that was completed.
bad,"They say good things always come to an end, and my good thing came to an end when I was faced with discrimination.  I was told early on that Albemarle was a prejudice company, but I gave them a chance. This was my first job in corporate America, and it will probably be my last because this experience was the most humiliating thing I've ever faced. So in my opinion, you shouldn't work here especially in the Baton Rouge Corporate office, they use you and work you like a dang on Hebrew prisoner, just to mess over you in the end when they get everything they needed out of you."
bad,"This job required  only one person to work the entire deli alone. You  had to cook , clean , everything  by yourself.  The hardest part of  the job  i would have to say was  cleaning the oil  in the  deep fryer."
bad,"Management is horrible, they fire you for no reason, talk about all their employees, deli serves food thats hours over the throw away limit, some co-workers are awesome but others are only there for a paycheck. Hours are usually long and pay is horrible as well.  This is by far the worst company i have ever worked for"
bad,"Dist. Manager is bad, she visits and oversee's many stores and belittles employee's , even in front of customers. When you ask for help she treats you like a dog and treats/talks about other Employee's. You as a Customer should not see or hear this, there Management is Terrible."
bad,"If you are an older employee you are targeted. Company always tries to buy out anyone over 55 once you are 60 if you make it that far your days are numbered, very poor managers most are not experienced."
bad,"poor communication, heavy handed central organization, confused strategy, poor employee retention and noncompetitive salary in a very competitive work environment."
bad,"low pay long hours, associates are not appreciated, you get fired for no reason and then they always deny unemployment"
bad,This is a filthy job where managment feel they own the employees. Your work load will be very high with criticism waiting when you fall behind in performing the impossible.
bad,This is a company in transition from a chemical vendor to a mining company. There has never been a clear vision articulated. If you are not a chemical engineer you are not valued here.
bad,I work for Alco for  a year and a half.   At first I loved it great manager great customers.  When given a new manager things went south real quick.  New manager thought she knew everything and allowed favorite employee to call out minutes before his shift with  no repercussions!  You got a good manager and a good crew you'll be OK.
bad,"A typical day at work:"
bad,"Worked here for a bit over a year, was ask to resign because of asking questions about how and why operations within the company were ran like they were. instead of giving explanations to the questions, the owner had a HR representative call me in and ask me to resign."
bad,"You can get hours, but the company does not pay well. Expect a lot of work for little pay.  Tell you to take breaks, but no associate's to relieve you for the breaks."
bad,Albemarle has an increasing atrition rate for young and old employees not in management.  There are no project professionals in management yet they make all the decisions on projects.  Often those decisions are wrong and they cause everyone to jump through hoops to try and achieve impossible time lines.  Currently they have decided to try and outsource to 23rd party engineering companies without owner representative oversight which is a recipe for high cost over runs and a massive amount of change orders.  Management preaches core values but does not follow the values they try and instill.   Overall the current direction of the company is not sustainable and caution should be taken if accepting employment.
bad,Management really sucks. Great pay to be in magnolia ar. There’s a lot of people that don’t like to see others do good. There is no good leadership there.
bad,A typical work day at Albemarle was  very rushed and very challenging. My work day started at 3:30 in the morning. We worked 12 hour shifts. This is a union plant that was built many years ago and the mind set has not changed.
good,Very great place got to know the everyday customers and see there smiling faces everyday made my day. But my manager at the time was stealing from the company blaming it on other employees
good,indeed is bull for me having to write a review on a job i was employed with years ago and barely remember. All i remember is that the job wasn't the best.
good,Opportunity for increased responsibility beyond traditional background.
good,"Safety has gotten in the way of being safe. Trying to go beyond OSHA standards doesn't make sense. Such as using standard safety harnesses on 4' platforms just encumbers the workers and makes them more likely to hurt themselves. It might look good on paper, but this company has forgotten about it's people. They aren't worried about the actual safety, as long as it looks safe. That's the long and short of it, this company does not care about it's employees. That's why it's selling pieces off. Profit over sustainability and productivity. They won't be around much longer. Long time employees are leaving in droves. This is what happens when you hire a lawyer as CEO and engineers to run a business instead of business people."
good,great place for kids to get job skills. its a fun place to work. work not really hard. get great discounts. upper management is great they are willing to work with anyone as long as your willing to learn and work.
good,I only recommend this company if you dont have to earn a living...good for someone starting out that doesn't have a family. I have always busted my behind for the company and have yet to get recognized for all that i do. Im a hard worker and this company doesn't take pride. Im over worked and underpaid!
good,A good place to work with an exception to not many hours and poor management.
good,A good company to work for; balance working culture; team members are not happy with senior management's decision to move their positions to North Carolina.
good,"Lots of challenging work, good place to make a career of it. I was laid off which is the only reason I am not there now. I would recommend this job to any chemist."
good,"Great first look into finance. "
good,Fairly good benefits. Overall good place to work for engineers.
good,"if you want any kind of a life don't work here ,very dangerous jobs,pay is great though,change schedule at the drop of a hat,make you comply with stuff,you're not even certified for"
good,"Good place to learn about specialty chemicals."
good,"A heavy work load and multiple tasks running in tandem. It was a bit crazy at times however, the work was never boring. Lots of problem solving and ""on your feet"" type thinking."
good,"If you work in manufacturing for this company you will really enjoy your job. Other support areas like IT, Finance, Purchasing, etc do not get the funds to setup an exceptional department."
good,Great internship experience.  Company focused on safety.  Engineering department was very hands on with the day to day operations and maintained good relationships with operators.  Plant was focused on productivity without sacrificing quality.
good,"the manager was friendly and fellow employees where amiable as well.Working third shift meant I stocked shelves,cooler, and soda racks. while taken care of any patrons."
good,"working with co-workers and with public was fun, cleaning store and outside, stocking coolers, waiting on customers"
good,"Albemarle is a great place to start working and gain experience.  I have been here for my whole career so far (7 years and counting) and you get to experience many different things throughout your career.  If there was a downside to Albemarle, I would say it is the lack of focus on the future and the amount of knee jerk reactions that take place.  As far as advancement goes, your basically either have to be open to move sites or perform an expat assignment to move up.  There are not many levels of middle management, so your exposure to high profile individuals can remain high in stressful times/projects.  This can function as a way to show what you have as well as a way to show your failures."
good,I have learned many different payroll policies and procedures. For instance we have started an implementation of a new payroll system. It was very challenging but fun at the same time.
good,"I loved the atmosphere at my plant because I planned my work days with the supervision in notes and just knowing my plant and what needed to be done.  If I needed additional help on a project, it was easily scheduled.  A typical day would be taking samples to the lab to and record results, make rounds checking all equipment through site and sound, house keeping, 5 S duties, run plant by computer.  "
good,Had a wonderful time working there. Employees worked together to create a positive work environment. Management was also  receptive to concerns of employees. Overall had a positive experience.
good,"This was an excellent place to work, the only problem I had with this store was the location. The location was in a very bad part of Albemarle."
good,Solid work place enviroment overall. Company practices what they preach in terms of there foundation and giving back to the communiteis they work and operate in.
good,"The company is great to work for with excellent benefits such as a large 401k match and flexible hours and location. The flexibility only applies if you have a good manager. The company has a lot of good managers and a lot of bad managers. If you get a good manager, you will be well taken care of if you do a good job. If you get a bad manager, you will watch others less capable pass you by and you won't get all the benefits."
good,Hectic work environment where I learned a lot about payroll and benefits.  I enjoyed working for both managers I had and the workplace culture was positive.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with disgruntled employees and the part I enjoyed most was my coworkers.
good,There are many new projects with a lot of opportunity for development and engagement on interesting projects and chemistries.  There is currently a lot of growth in this industry.  Hours can be long without overtime especially around site turnarounds.
good,"Ik begin de dag (7:00) met een kopje thee of water."
good,Effective team work...Everyone around me were driven to give and do their best..
good,Albemarle is a good place to work. I would only say being sent to other locations for extended periods of time is a quality that is not desirable for this company.
good,I enjoyed the people that I worked with and I truly felt that I was making a difference in the company.  I kept very busy on a daily basis and each day was something new which kept it interesting.
good,"Megbízható munkahely, azonban az előrelépésre viszonylag kevés lehetőség van."
good,"Albemarle is a great company to work for because they have recently acquired a very exciting raw material - Lithium. "
good,I have learned many different payroll policies and procedures. Enjoy working with the employees at the different sites. I have learned how payroll works at a Union and Non-Union site.
good,"Good place to work. The management is good, the time off is good, and plenty of room for opportunity. Mentorship is taken seriously."
good,- A big company acting like a small one.  Has both positives and negatives resulting from this.  Colleagues are great.  Advancement depends on length of service with the company.
good,Job was to far from my home when my current job became available I took it to save road time. To many call out due to shortage of instrument techs.
good,"Albemarle is a wonderful company to work for.  The salary is generally high and most of the people are very nice and very talented.  The benefits are also extremely generous.  If they had not moved their headquarters to Charlotte, North Carolina - I would still be working for them - as would many of their former Baton Rouge employees, I'm sure.  Louisiana's loss is North Carolina's gain."
good,Productive and professional workplace.  The most enjoyable part of the day was going home. Management took their employees into consideration on work schedule.  The employees that were full time worked well with the contract workers.  If a question was asked people didn't mind answering your question.
good,"I love that we have flexible work schedules at Albemarle.  It is great for morale.  "
good,Albemarle Corporation is a great company to work for and progress in your career.  Being an international company you have numerous opportunities to grow within the company along with the ability to experience many diverse cultures.
good,Its a good place to work. I am just looking to expand my knowledge.  I learned how safety plays a very important role in the industry. The most important for me is to provide more for my family.
good,"Albemarle gave great benefits (medical, dental, vision, etc.) and the ability to work from home 1 day out of the week. The job advancement opportunities have dried up as the company is moving out of state."
good,"leuke werkplek, aardige collega's , routine werk, soms weinig uitdaging"
good,The co-worker are more like family. they are respectful and professional.
good,"was very productive ,big on safety and awareness ,respectful to employees, goood on the job training"
good,"Albemarle is good company and I enjoy working here most days.  However, middle management needs to be as forward-thinking as the C-Suite & Individual Contributors. Advancement opportunities are limited for employees, although the company is experiencing amazing growth and this seems to be due to the lack of leadership at the Director and VP levels."
good,"Productive work with plenty of different jobs to learn, on your feet a lot but easy to get along with other coworkers that are willing to help out. Learned to do lockout tag out on all the equipment, learned how to run utilities by maintaining steam pressure, air pressure, process water coming into the plant. Learned how to run the units, ABB dcs systems"
good,"If you do your job and do it well, you are respected and have potential for advancement.  Management does work with most everyone to accommodate personal issues, etc.  The job can be intense and there was lots of work.  But overall, a good place to have a career."
good,Enjoyed my work once it was turned over to me.  Lots of different opportunities.  Lots of place to tour in the plant and learn about how chemicals were made.
good,The hours are long but time goes by quickly. Managers and district managers are very good. If I didnt have a child I would go back to work here.
good,"Assisted supervisors with daily administrative activities. Scheduled meetings, events and interviews. Organized and audited essential paperwork. Participated in networking events and intern activities, group meetings and presentations. Very supportive and encouraging supervisors. At times hard to stay occupied on ""slow"" days.

good,"A day at Albemarle is do rounds checking mechanical pumps and taking samples of product..  Safety is the most important culture at the plant. I loved being able to set my day up and work my schedule."
good,"Great place to work. Everyday at Albemarle was a new adventure, always learning something new and interesting. The culture at /albemarle was very safety oriented and management preached the fact that safety is number 1. This is something that I will carry on to my next and evry career. This job also gave me the option to participate on the emergency response team where I was able to learn skills such as CPR and interior fire fighting which is something I have always been interested in. Fire fighting is something I feel we should all know in this specific job field and I am glad I will be able to take these skills elsewhere"
good,Most days the payroll department would start the very early mornings with breakfast and general conversations this made for a great start to the day.  At times the job was very stressful going thru implementations and acquisitions. Talking with the employees to make sure their payroll ran smoothly was one of the most enjoyable parts of the day.
good,"They are willing to train new employees. A new person coming on board feels valued. For an employee that loves to aquire new knowledge, there is a ton to learn."
good,"This was a safe and productive environment. People worked together, and team work was a major thing in the offices.  I was able to learn and advance.  I enjoy my work"

good,"Great company to work for, benefits were awesome, depending on location, you could drive a distance for work but it was worth it. Awesome management team,"
good,Worked a flexible 8-10 hour day.  The workplace was a comfortable atmosphere with management working closely to achieve desired outcome.  It was a good learning experience especially when the company offered excel classes to improve our computer skills. Coworkers made it enjoyable with their camaraderie.  And the most difficult part was not reaching the desired outcome of our research.
good,This is honestly one of the best places I have ever worked. The management was outstanding and truly valued what each and everyone brought to the table and put everyone in a position to succeed and thrive.
good,I learned a great deal of new information from this job because it exposed me to a completely new experience which was my first in the professional industry.
