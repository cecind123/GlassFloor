good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
bad,Do your research on departments before you accept an offer. Micro management at its finest and lack of respect for workers across the board. Little to no job security.
bad,"CBRE, There policy : If you get hurt on the job and your not a 100% when you come back ,,they fire you. Your Just a number, not a person. I had torn my rotor cuff on the job, HR said dont worry get better. Will help you. 2 surgeries later all done. HR said we have to let you go, the Doctor said your not a 100% good luck, your fired. True story.."
bad,"No support from management "
bad,"don't trust the management, micro management is ,much, can't get nothing done. even if you put in over 65 hours a week you still not doing anything. if you salary dont work here"
bad,"I would not recommend working here.  The work culture is over burdening and you are left unappreciated.  It can be a very toxic work environment if you are left working with bad higher level management, which the company does not do anything about toxic demeaning manipulative managers."
bad,"Management was proud of the Union Bank contract being one of the worst to work on, as the client was considered the boot camp client in the San Francisco Bay area because the lead client contact was often rude when communicating to the CBRE team.  He would use his authority to demean the CBRE staff in meetings with others present.  This lead also did not manage his time well, which resulted in excessive ""urgent"", ad-hoc requests with unreasonable deadlines. As a result, 3 to 4 days out of the week was spent working until 10 or 11 pm at night (with the day starting at 6:30 or 7:00 am). I think it's extremely unprofessional for a client to abuse their position power just because they are working with consultants.  It's even more problematic for leadership within the consulting firm to allow such behavior from any client.  Not all money is good money."
bad,"CBRE is very good in other Locations/States except in Telugu 2 States, Telangana & Andhrapradesh CBRE Senior Management have become Non-scence and Critisizing Junior Staff too much"
bad,Terrible place to work to racists to much good ole boy networking and not enough money or promotions for good people of color you would be better off working for an apartment complex.
bad,"You Get lost in the big green machine - not enough care & attention to employees - care too much about money"
bad,"Just bad, management is willing to get rid of you anytime.  Job was eliminated after a year,, No help on finding a new job,, and not transparent at all with me.."
bad,"Not a fun place to work in corporate."
bad,I can only speak for the payroll department at CBRE. Everything about the payroll department is terrible. Unorganized and a lot of favoritism. Turn over rate is super high. They’re always having to replace management and they will never replace management with internal hiring. They always hire externally. They don’t cross train. They pay everybody bonuses except payroll. It’s just an unfair department to work for.
bad,"- No room for growth "
bad,"I worked for the company as a contractor for AT&T."
bad,I work forCBRE on the Experian contract I was bullied out my job and CBRE did nothing Richard Yearly of Experian was the facilities manager he got rid of anybody he dislikes and CBRE would let this happen
bad,"Very poor administration"
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
bad,"Toxic!!!  I am a licensed Building Engineer in the DMV. In all my years I’ve never witnessed anything like this. These guys are not honest people. A billion dollar company that forces their people to work overtime and not pay you for it. My fellow teammates work 10 hour days and only get paid for 8. On call??? No compensation. Your constantly on the chopping block. You will be thrown under the bus .....I was with CBRE for just under two years. During that period I had to deal with 6 different remote managers. That’s right 6. On this account they lied to the client constantly. The did not want to pay to fix anything but the made millions from the clients. I was once strongly questioned about a purchase requisition for one roll of TEFLON TAPE. I just went out and bought some myself because I cared about the customer"
bad,"Short staffed & under pressure constantly."
bad,"Es una Empresa Vende Burras."
bad,"CBRE was one of the worst career experiences I have ever had. This company does not value their employees or compensate them fairly. The management team ""played favorites"" with college classmates. This was very disheartening to see as a new graduate. Avoid this corporate black hole!"
bad,There is something seriously wrong with a company culture that has you travel to multiple interviews at well over £100 per return trip so that they dont have to rework their schedules and then doesn't bother to call you to say sorry you didnt get the job - they just ghosted me. Surely if someone has invested that much time and money into interviewing with your company you could perhaps find the time give them a two minute call?
bad,"did not agree with the way they ran a particular building ."
bad,"The workload with CBRE is challenging which is what I truly enjoyed.  I love a good challenge.  Management including Chief Officers, need lots of training in humanity, and a great deal of training on how to avoid favoritism.  If they allow all their Leads to LEAD, they might just learn a thing or two on how to get things done.  "
bad,"Being a third party for CBRE was okay, can be very stressful, especially if management does not back you up. Never seen a pay raise, in order to get promoted, you would have to relocate to another facility or someone would have to quit, so on, so forth. The pay was not so well compared to Amazon facilities technicians versus third party pay."
bad,"I can't believe i stick out for a year to be part of this toxic place. the environment and culture is so painful to be around and the managers are all from small town rural area and have no human relationship skills. They just know how to do their assigned tasks because they were there for 12 years and more as managers, and  are careless about their employees and their welfare. And if you are a person of color, run for you life because they will treat you so wrong and would load you up with more work and work until you quit because you can't take the stress. The point system they use for employee workload is biased and people of color are given more and their point system allocation is misleading when compared to their colleagues. "
bad,Company might be great as a whole but certain leaders are poor and are in their positions because of connections.  Its too bad people with good qualifications are not leading.
bad,"Cliquey and disorganized work environment. "
bad,"Société à éviter à tout prix. Aucun respect du collaborateur et mauvaise politique RH. Le management est médiocre et les perspectives d'évolution de carrière sont inexistantes."
bad,No one knew who to speak with until they were laying me off. My former supervisor never sat down to finalize the annual review. He also was far from helpful in talks about career advancement
bad,I found CB to be a cut throat firm.  Management has no line of sight to the teams they manage and they only deal with their direct managers.  Very frustrating to get work approved.
bad,"CBRE Middleest has worst management team"
bad,Managers with very little experience in the field of engineering they are managing i.e.  Mobile Commercial gas. Constantly being threatened  with disciplinary action for any trivial matter. I found the Bristol office to be intimidating and run with a culture of absolute disregard for the health and welfare of their engineers. The only people that seemed to matter were the management and office staff. All of whom I found to be incompetent above and beyond anything I could imagine and actively looking to be offended by any contact or communication from engineers. I left for a better paid and better run company of my own accord as soon as they managed to lose a major contract with a well known supermarket.
bad,Benefits are horrible.  No support system to back you in your job and can't depend on your managers to give you pertinent information regarding accounts.  Same people are awarded star employees every month.  There is a lot of favoritism shown toward certain employees.  Not appreciated as a valued employee.
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
bad,"cbre is a very backwards, goofed up managment group that is really not or should be in the market of maintenance managment oras they tryed to start up without proper licenses or documentation to begin running a staff of trades people."
bad,"Horrible experience. RUN! Management were insane, false, non-genuine people who didn't know what they were doing and in their panic and fear of being found out, they over promised and agreed to unreasonable and unethical deliverables."
bad,"Was in Dinwiddie Location Ric 1. Ran building with no support for 8months.Former boss was  at helping out with issues. One day new person comes in takes over, let all of us go and building has went down since.  Old work colleagues still call me and complain about them til this day.  Word of  advice CBRE...  A company isn't ran off know it all managers, it's showing people  you care and are willing to go that extra mile......"
bad,"You leave your personal life behind..."
bad,"I am a maintenance tech in a 500,000 thousand square foot building,responsible for plumbing,electrical,hvac,painting,fire pump rooms ,generators,dock doors and levelers .My take home pay is 630 dollars per week.This is probably the worst place a maintenance technician can work.We have some of the most childish and ignorant managers in the industry.I have seven years of experience.I would probably do better working in fast food.Do not waste your time with these crooks ,I am headed out of this future less rat hole of a company."
bad,"Ai Atlanta is like a revolving door, no sooner you get to know the person's name HE or SHE is terminated for the most unlikely reasons. I saw so many good people get terminated it was truly horrible the work enviroment no one was happy at all even the students didn't seem to be enjoying there time as well."
bad,Was one of the worst places I have ever worked management does not have your best interest they  will throw you under the buss to save there on skin line Danny Zucco and joe fitz they can not be trusted and fired immediately
bad,"working with our existing client is a HORRIBLE working environment!! Management has no other experience or training outside of CBRE and therefore cannot effectively represent the employees. They will not speak up about employee compensation or the working environment, moral etc. to the proper management personnel. It is all about pleasing the client and the employees who make it happen are..."
bad,This was the worst experience I have ever had in my professional career. The broker treated me like an inconvenience and was so rude and disrespectful. I had a terrible experience and I would never wish it on my worst enemy.
bad,local management was fine but corporate is something AWFUL most people don't start at the top!  Corp. seems to forget what it was like climbing up !!!
bad,"Supervisor was rude and had no problem screaming in your face or cussing you out. If you had to take off for family things, it was always a problem. Never listen to your opinion. Played favorites with employees,"
bad,"Somebody, somewhere, believes this is an IT Services Company - it ain't."
bad,"It's a turning door style. They get people in, use them up, and spit them out. Training is non existent and the culture is demeaning. What else needs to be said."
bad,this firm treats its engineers like second class citizens finding any way to terminate your employment if you do not agree with issues with hs with the job they have no management skills and give rolls to managers who have no technical knowledge of the post they are in and will not listen to engineers and do not care about employees health or welfare
bad,So anxious to have someone competent but then abuses them.  Agency misrepresented the job - I found everyone unpleasant.  I was left with very little information about the systems when the manager took off for her honeymoon.  she assured me others knew how to help me but they didn't.  I was left to flounder with what I knew.  Everyone was very unpleasant most of the time and one person was never to be found when work was to be done.
bad,"Very poor management, top heavy on management, understaffed for engineers,"
bad,"I would not recommend working at CBRE"
bad,There was never a typical day at work. Management was only concerned with the bottom line. It was a culture of vultures. For many years this office had a delightful Operations Manager who was sadly never allowed to do her job properly.
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
bad,"I would never recommend CBRE as an employer.  There is no communication between management staff, unclear direction, lack of pay, poor benefits. There is no training to staff and clear direction is not given to staff of objectives or work load."
bad,It was eh . a company that came in removed all the knowledgeable people in the building and replaced them with new management that has no clue and is in way over they're heads with the new policies. but thats jus my experience
bad,"This is an absolutely awful place to work. They only care about making as much money as possible and don't care about their employees at all. They give everyone the same training no matter their position, which is useless because accounting training does you absolutely no good if you work in IT. The culture is similar to that of a high school. People will be artificially nice to you in front of others, but are awful to you when you are alone. If you are not one of the ""popular crowd"", then you can forget about ever advancing in the company no matter how hard you work. The management does not care about you (unless you are one of the ""popular crowd"") and will demean you and make you question your self-worth. A typical day at work consisted of constantly having managers and other people complain about all of their problems and when you solved their problems, telling you that it wasn't the solution they wanted.  Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this company. Working here will cost your your happiness and sanity."
bad,"Empresa de porte grande, porem carência em valorização  do funcionário"
bad,You are given a weeks worth of work that must be completed in one day.  The manager does not respond to any of your issues.  You have no support
bad,"Save The Headaches you will get, and NO Pay Raises, No training, and if you like working with a Team, Forget It, No Leadership,"
bad,"i been with this company for a year, NO Pay Raises, No Training, just a day at CBRE, then you get more WORK,So find some where , a not CBRE. Save the Headaches you will get"
bad,"Before taking the job I was warned by a former mentor that they would ""suck the life out of you"" since she had worked for them previously."
bad,", ZERO training. Job scope changed daily. Too much gossiping in the office, too much favoritism. Too many people hired to do nothing while others were expected to do everything without training. Too many bosses. I disliked going to work every single day."
bad,Treated badly by client and employer. They were only concerning with keeping the contract and would do anything to keep it. Management were shocking and constantly backstabbing.
bad,"Admin, treats you like dirt, they don't know anything about, facility, maintainence, they don't communicate well, talk down to you!"
bad,"This is a very bad company to work for, they promise you the world and never keep their word. I am sorry that I ever took the job with this company, I will never work for a commercial real estate company again they are too cheap and provide nothing to their employees."
bad,"I truly learned about real estate during my employment here. I especially enjoyed the online training hat was offered to employees. My supervisor was great, she was there for me 24/7 with any problems .,"
bad,Not a good work environment. Very critical and very non supportive VP of Asset Management. This person went beyond The Devil wears Prada. Total Nightmare. 00000 stars.
bad,"I could've written the review WARNING!! DO NOT WORK HERE!! because it sounds exactly like my experiences with this company. "
bad,"Limited training, then once you get to know the program, they change it.  Worked for four different clients, with the word that when the contract ends there are other accounts to go to.  Wrong every time a contract ended you get laid off.  Then when another account starts up they call you back.   Very stressful, People put in chage of an account don't know there a-- from their elbow on what has to be done.  If you have any experience, don't go here"
bad,"Environment was extremely stale.  There was no creativity and folks always seemed to be looking over their shoulders.  Also, the folks could use a class in diversity."
bad,They will tell you anything to get you to come to work there but will look you in the eye and lie to you about how they take care of their guy's. That's not true. Also you have very little direct access to human resources for questions or concerns they are even in the same state. The supervisors that I worked with had less experience than I do but you don't know anything your experience is insignificate. Also the supervisors will shake your hand and tell you that they are better than others because? I made the biggest mistake of my career working for CBRE.
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
bad,"Anyone applying for a Lease Analyst position, beware! The job descriptions are old and misleading - a fact they are aware of but have purposefully not updated them."
bad,"CBRE are an  American Company and it's all about the bottom line."
bad,"Not basing CBRE anywhere but in AZ. They treat you as you are lucky to have a job state, instead of right to work state. Lack of expierence, training, etc when it comes to performance."
bad,"I've been with CBRE for a many years and have found it to be, by far, my worst working experience. Knowledge and skill are not valued because that combination makes you hard to brainwash. If you are over 40 or a minority you need not apply. You will be discriminated against in ways you never even imagined possible."
bad,fast paced work enviorment with work demand changing every moment
bad,Brokerage side is okay.
bad,"Took a month to go through hiring process, when I finally got the job they wanted you on call 24/7 but overtime was never right. Insurance was a joke. Employees treated horribly, not equipped for job assigned. Expected to work regardless of proper safety procedures. No advancement opportunities. Horrible place to work. Avoid at all costs. Lowest pay in the industry."
bad,This place is incredibly cheap and the management is horrific. You will regret joining this company.
bad,good luck if you take a position with this co....they have a revolving door so much that they even lost lawsuits for wrongful termination..
bad,"TUPE'd into CBRE from another contractor, Within a week of transfer, Ts & Cs were forcibly change with the threat of "" we will just terminate your contract"" no mention of just giving a new contract thus fear of losing job altogether"
bad,"Management could give 2 brown turds about there employees, Safety is just don't get caught and if you do management will deny telling you to do it. Plenty of paperwork & little to no training on anything. Little support for on call & the more you kiss toosh the higher you'll go in management.. Experience is not  required to be in charge."
bad,Väldigt inkompetenta chefer och arbetsledare. De skulle inte kunna jobba på ett seriöst företag med samma positioner. Kunskapen eller bristen på den lyser igenom väldigt mycket. Man ägnar sig åt en uppgift som man inte har en aning om.
bad,"The staff are mostly commercial real estate agents/brokers, basically sales people which 90% are men who wear suits and ties to work every day. The women are mostly administrative support staff for the real estate agents/brokers. The office is a very professional environment, which seems impressive, but the men agents/brokers have high egos that I hear them yell and speak in condescending tone to their admin support staff. It happens constantly in the office and no one says anything. The management will not address any concerns by the support department because the agents/brokers are the ones generating income for the company. They do not train and expect new employees to come in and know their ""system"", which is unheard of with any company. They seem very professional on the outside, but it's very unprofessional environment once you're inside and working for the company."
bad,"Disaster from beginning to the very end, Mangement do not help and support is completely non existent "
bad,"Ole Boys Network!  There are a few women in leadership positions who been promoted after 30 years of service!  The place is terrible; nepotism, favoritism and smothering micro-managing Directors.  Bullying, intimidation, Cut-throat culture of backbiting and deception.  Their HR Dept is a joke, also diversity (people of color) in leadership positions is virtually non-existent.  Deloitte and PWC are much better employer options as they have a proven track record of valuing their employees, and promoting inclusion within hiring and promotion practices."
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
bad,A typical day was learning that management didn't care for work life balance or workplace culture much and the hardest part of the job was finding anything to enjoy about it.
bad,"CBRE promise to support staff, but never do. Overwork employees to the extent of there health and well being. "
bad,"Working at CBRE was the worst job I've ever had, and I've had some bad jobs. I worked my butt off, but it was a fool's errand. Every day was a marathon; I barely had time to go to the bathroom. Most days were 10 or more hours long, and I had to be ""available"" when I wasn't at work, even on vacation/time off. (This wasn't brain surgery; it was commercial real estate!) Despite my nearly two decades of overall work experience and 10 years in commercial real estate (more experience than men on my team), they made more money."
bad,This company tries to talk the talk but falls way short of walking the walk.  Management is selfish. If you work here you will be on your own.  Good luck.
bad,"I was put off and put off about a career path to advance, which was a big selling point in my interview for the job. I have been told that maybe we can talk about it in 2020. I was told that in 2018. Management falsifies reports and emails, and misrepresents spending of clients' money. Benefits are costly with high deductibles and no co-pays."
bad,"Some flexibility with the schedule but very corporate culture and a lack of empathy from those I work with. It is not the most positive work environment. Very old-school thinking. Very stressful environment and some of the higher position people have temperaments that leave a lot to be desired. Not a very collaborative environment and the free address office seating is loud and disruptive. Hard to concentrate. There is not a lot of advancement opportunities and a lot of HR issues that Management chooses to ignore. There is no local level HR support system or dept. to provide relief. The pay is not competitive. Offers were made but not followed through. It is a hostile, negative work environment and the Management team are all new to their roles. They don't know what they are doing. They do not care about their employees at all. There is no trust. It is a terrible place to work."
bad,"Management do not allow any errors and will performance manage you out of the company if you are not good enough or up to their high standard. They are ruthless and unforgiving. "
bad,Pay is below average for building maintenance. Benefits are barely average. Supervisors aren’t on your side. Don’t supply proper tools. Don’t observe state laws on paying properly. Give you cheap tablet to do your work on. You can find a better job that’s for sure.
bad,"Caused me to go on stress leave. Horrible management. Had several panic attacks while I worked there.This was normal. They give you more work if you do a great job and those that dont do well get away with doing the minimum,"
bad,"The main problem with the Glasgow office of CBRE is that you are basically seen as admin support / PAs by the rest of the offices and are treated extremely rudely by the surveyors. There is too much work to do and not enough people. Constant changes to try to solve the work load problems without every really speaking to the people that do it. It really is a horrible environment to work in. So many people leave in the first year (or even the first week in many instances). Back stabbing, stress leave, poor pay, quick to manage people out of the business where their face doesn't fit. 18 months is long enough for me, get me out!"
bad,"Your experience depends entirely on the client account you work on.  The client calls the shots 100%, even if what they want violates the cbre contract with the client. Cbre's concerns are 110% related to the client's demands, and cbre will throw any cbre employee under the bus if the client wants that to happen."
bad,"Avoid working for cbre on any contact, wages are under payed and late, they promise career development but that is just a ploy to get u in the door,very little support."
bad,"Not enough staff for the workload. Employees have to work crazy hours to get reporting completed. No overtime paid, just assumed that you will work till the job is completed. The workplace is top heavy with too many levels of heirarchy. Management appears approachable but not trustworthy. Career progression is available due to the many levels mentioned above, however only if you're a favourite and your face fits. Staff turnover is high and other team members suffer due to the constant training requirements."
bad,"The company gives highest priority to its clients completely ignoring aspirations of its employees. Employees have a deep sense of insecurity working here. Decisions that are taken in the best interest of the organization are not backed up by the bosses. Bosses are only concerned about their relations with the clients and do not take care of their subordinates."
bad,"This staff as an extremely high voluntary turnover rate, and that should speak volumes not only to potential candidates, but the client, and the CBRE management above the account."
bad,Hard work decent money poor managers ! I regret going here it was a waste of time and vehicle managers and brokers are all that counts here
bad,Working with fellow colleagues was amazing.  We all got along and we were always doing things for each other.  Management was not so nice.  They really take their titles to their head and they are only temporary employees.
bad,"You are expected to be polite, even to the people who make you look bad by not providing you with what you need to do your job. You are expected to let people insult you, turn the other cheek, and NOT try to defend yourself. When you excel and take on more work, nobody (especially the management) says anything to recognize your accomplishments. If and when you make a mistake, the management magnifies it to unreasonable proportions. When you do well, they give you more work, but keep you at the same salary level, all the while playing down any significant contributions you make for the company. Anyone that wishes to avoid unreasonable people, may want to take some of these thoughts into consideration."
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
bad,I do normally not do a review but this company miss represents is self so much. First of all it took me a month before the first member of management even introduced them self to me. You should feel lucky if you get paid on time and it is correct. They are more worried about trying to brain wash you into thinking that there company is so great that they forget about taking care of the important thing like pay benefits and getting work done. If you ask a question about the job management's standard answer are just keep done what you been doing or that is a good question and then walk away.
bad,"The only redeeming thing about working for CBRE is their benefits. "
bad,"I had the most horrible experience at this company. They treat the contract employees like no one ever treats. They hire for 10 days and fire. Non stop work. Terrible bosses. "
bad,"Three words for CBRE DC......... TOXIC, TOXIC, TOXIC."
bad,"Toxic place to work No support  from management and colleagues are awful to each other  "
bad,"If you are a part of New Delhi Salesforce Team, your life will be so stressful that you will start getting irritated on everything. Please avoid this company."
bad,"I worked for them less than a year, had a written contract with them and they broke it, did not receive promise yearly bonus even after completing term, they hire very nasty HR personnel without checking there past work history, I was let go and have yet to receive a formal letter stating why, I still have there company credit card. Let's just say I would never work for this company again and will tell anyone who is even thinking of working with this company, That they should really think twice before joining them."
bad,"This company is completely out of touch with visual design. If you're a designer you will be nothing but frustrated dealing with people who don't have a knowledge or appreciation for it. "
bad,"The job went from 40 hours a week, to working 6 days a week 15 hour days. Management only cares about renewing contracts.  The staff is so lean they have unrealistic expectations. The deadlines that are impossible to meet. Unless you work until 2:30 a.m.. all workflows and dashboards are completed via Microsoft Excel there's no systems.  Worst company ever with balancing your home life"
bad,"At almost 50 yrs old, I started working when I had to get a workers permit.  This company is by far the worst atmosphere I've ever witnessed.  They are more worried about a law suit for firing a bad manager who stole from the company and divided an entire team than to let her go.  Hence within an 8 month time frame, only 2 employees remained.  The Director was just as bad because when confronted by the entire office, he turned and looked the other way, wouldn't respond to emails.  He totally disregarded an entire team and listened to the one person that had no work ethic, integrity or morals/values.  The culture was simply a joke and mission statement didn't apply!"
bad,"The property management department has experienced unusually high turn over during the past 3 years and upper management has chosen to turn a blind eye despite employees voicing their frustration with lack of support and leadership. If you want to work in a chaotic unsupported environment, this is the place to be!"
bad,This company is filled with prejudice people hands down also filled with men with no honor or respect for the working man its a company run by a manager who is never there CBRE IS THE WORST COMPANY TO WORK FOR HANDS DOWN
bad,"Disaster from beginning to the very end, there help and support is completely non existent"
bad,"En mi caso no tuve una buena experiencia profesional. El sector es dinámico e interesante pero las condiciones de trabajo dejan mucho que desear. Es una empresa que quiere ir de moderna y revolucionaria en ideas como las instalaciones pero en el fondo es de mente arcaica y casposa. Los sueldos son mínimos considerando la carga de trabajo, responsabilidad y exigencias. Nunca se me valoró ni económica ni moralmente mi esfuerzo, a pesar de echar bastantes más horas que las estipuladas en mi contrato laboral y finalizar las tareas en tiempo y forma. Unas exigencias que no son reales."
bad,Management seems to be more concerned with their clients and procedures than they are with their employees.  They don't take into consideration employee strengths but ask employees to all be the same as each other.
bad,"A éviter, même pas pour une expérience ! Aucun respect de la personne et encore moins du travail."
bad,I was originally told many positive things about working for this company and that they advance from within. This is not the case. They brought in people from outside for many positions that they could have advanced the correct people.
bad,Manager was completely incompetent and under qualified. Micro managing and placing blame on Technicians for his own short comings!! Completely ruined what could be a decent job.!! Constantly receiving calls in the boiler room from vendors and contractors looking to get paid after being ignored by the onsite manager!
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
bad,Very professional and overall medium place to work. Always busy and environment .Networking and developmental skills. Hands on in your face assignments.
bad,"I learned that CBRE does not care about you. No matter how much effort, time, and energy you put into your job, they do not care. You are just another number."
bad,The company appears to be driven by profit at expense of employees welfare. I never had an appraisal in 2 years and it felt like a constant battle from day one!
bad,"No support, tools or parts to perform needed duties. Everything is on a shoe string budget and employee on site are kept in the dark. Not a positive experience and very frustrating to employee who just want to do there job."
bad,"Management suppresses the help and takes all the credit and bonuses. Ethics are a joke. Senior leadership covers for the management but not the hourly paid employee. Perhaps different at the corporate workplace but not at the client account level."
bad,"Having worked in this company has been a nightmare for me and my family."
bad,"The Company is Good & my colleagues are good."
bad,"hired for my hvac/r experience, yet most duties were at the handyman level. most hvac/r units were contracted out to national contractors for savings....didn't make sense."
bad,I have to say working here a year and I have had more time than any of almost walking out. The company will not back you. They expect you to give up your family for them. They will lie straight to your face and put you in uncomfortable position and then beat you up because you blinked while doing your job. They will give you more than one person can handle and yell at you when you fail to do the job of 4 people by yourself. If you don't have a life and want to work 72 hours a week for a client that will cut your throat if you step wrong this job is for you.
bad,Very cut throat with no clear guidance from management.  You have to play a guessing game to see what they want.  Very stressful environment with no direction or career advancement.
bad,"Management is poor at support for local employees.  Require 27/7 work week, pressure everyday to complete mundane information task.  Do not recognize what is important to the management of facilities."
bad,"A typical day is filled with stress, understaffed and under appreciated.    Our property was taken over by CBRE 7 months ago. They have used our engineers as a whipping post and do everything to bring in their own management team of women to straighten us out.   "
bad,"The directors down to the supervisors of the Asset Services department in Memphis are the most racist, unethical, unmoral, evil people I have encountered in my whole entire career. They will slander your name and create a hostile work environment for every person they decide they do not want to promote. They promote only on the basis of favoritism and not according to qualifications. If you are not a but kisser then you are not what they are looking for. The management team in this department consist of unknowledgeable , and unskilled women who gives CBRE a bad reputation as a company."
bad,This was cubicle Nirvana. I enjoyed my short stay...but I enjoy a more visible and highly agile environment where things are constantly changing.
bad,I worked here for 3 months. The training was horrific. No follow up help.
bad,This is and extremely racist company.I worked over 20 years and was let go because I spoke up when there were racial comments made.I was physically attacked by a white female and was told not to say anything about it or I would be fired.
bad,I worked my butt off for this company as a concierge. They constantly hired outside people and temps instead of advancing their own people. The supervisor I had harassed me daily and HR did NOTHING TO ASSIST ME I ENDED UP QUITTING. The supervisor only harassed the black female women. Never anyone else. I was constantly refused a pay increase for various frivolous reasons. Overall it could of been a great place to work but I had a very bad experience
bad,"I work as a Tech supporting the new Amazon site in Ottawa. It seemed like a great opportunity with promises of easy advancement and lots of growth but when you ask for those opportunities the managers always have a reason to avoid providing them."
bad,"The managers are self serving and do nothing to make employee lives better. They throwing workers on night after promising no night shift was ever going to happen. At first they hired the first wave of ppl at a much higher rate have since dropped the pay of all positions by about $2-5. "
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
bad,"Management at the Memphis location was very bias in advancement, disipline in direct violations, and work place communications with no remorse for there actions . Making the work place extremely stressful."
bad,I had worked for another company doing the same work before our company was taken over by CBRE and they wanted to hire me on. Ever since I started working for CBRE it was nothing but slow and un organized and still is to this day and none of them will stand up and fight for your position when they know you’re not at wrong.
bad,"Really disappointed I went to the interview and had a plan laid out for training to fill in gaps within my knowledge and as such was offered a lot less pay I agreed on the principle I would receive accredited training. Two weeks in told to learn from my colleague, no training no uniform no tools. I have handed my notice in due to very ineffective management. Lies about receiving aid and a coworker who couldn’t care less about work. I have been reporting all this to a contract manager and supervisor and have had no support or feedback so the only option is to move on"
bad,On the Amazon account you are expected to work 13 hour days. Management is terrible and HR does nothing when you have concerns. It's too big of a company where their people don't matter.
bad,"In a nut shell, you are expected to work like a dog and know everything that is happening at a drop of a hat. You get none of the praise when things are going well, but when something goes wrong, you automatically get the blame. "
bad,"Brought on as a IT Consultant and to assist with a recent M&A with the understanding of additional headcount in place would turn into a Full time position <which after 6 months was told headcount not there and was being let go>.  Discovered also at this time they were not thrilled with their existing Field Support person in place which put me in an awkward position as this was the person training me/ the only person providing any direction/ and being given different set of instructions from local office/s along with their Corporate location. They want to control everything from their Corporate office in a different state, but also provide no direction and the only time you hear from anyone in Management is when something is wrong. Company culture is horrible and probably one of the worst I have experienced and I have been in the IT business 19 years. I was enticed by the good pay when I started turning down other offers, but the culture of CBRE was not worth a few extra dollars.  You have been warned!"
bad,company didn't provide any facilities to employee. But site staff is helpful. And experience with management is not good. Salary package is not given as discussed at the time of interview some changes are made in joining letter after joining of job.
bad,I was given 4 companies to do accounting functions while the person I was replacing was only responsible for 2. I was trained by a co-worker and my supervisor was little or no help. Management looks down on employees asking other people for help and past mistakes are constantly held over people's heads
bad,"As per my experience, at typical day of work where time goes one cannot recognize. So much of work to do. My training was originally an performing actual work. I had learned under pressure. "
bad,Too much preference for those who are liked instead of those who work hard.Management talk bad about employees openly but they want to emphasize the rise values which is interesting because they don't follow those values themselves.
bad,Very bad management worked for this company for 10 years had 9 different bosses also I was involved in an accident at work while I was on workmans comp recovering from surgery I was fired
bad,"They hold meetings, events, and conferences for one thing in mind - to pat each other and themselves on the back. Worst company I have ever worked for"
bad,"CBRE hired a HR manager, a security manager and a Red Cross lab tech as managers in the past I have had to deal will, not one had maintenance knowledge."
bad,"Bad place to work, managers are so interested in pleasing the client they will toss you under the bus to look good. I had no training and my boss did not evert speak to me except to tell me I was doing something wrong. Some people in the office were great and helped, while some were cold and rude. In the 30 years I have been in the work force, this is the worst place I have ever worked."
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
bad,"Worked for them 2 times for 2 different accounts and hated both jobs. Both accounts had terrible managers. Large companies dont care about employees that much. Only advantage is pay and benefits other than that management is terrible. Too big for their pants. They dont get that ALL employees make the company, not just the managers."
bad,"Manager at CBRE should not be a manager. Doesn’t know how to handle bad situations. Was told more than once, that her permanent employees were bullying contact worker, and she did nothing about it. CBRE should send her to management training"
bad,"This is only in reference to the site I was on. Management has no idea what they are doing. During a safety class, the regional manager was laughing at a real accident where a lady got her clothing caught in a paper shredder. They do not know what people should or should be doing. They have no way of checking on people since they don't know what is required or involved. Guys just pencil whipped work orders and the site was going down the toilet. Also, management at the lower level had favorites which were the guys he grew up with, or lived in the same town or went to the same church etc.Our site was great until CBRE took over the role. The customer has no idea hoe badly their equipment is being maintained."
bad,Extremely poor and vicious management. Employees are disposable to them are treated with no respect. My only position with such a disappointing experience.
bad,"I may have just been unlucky, but the Auckland Team were self absorbed, devious, dishonest, and generally unpleasant. The Attitude to ANZ, who was the client, was to rip them off and make them pay for as much as possible, saving CBRE as much money as possible, so the staff all got big bonuses at year end. Not a FM partnership, and I hope ANZ got wise to it."
bad,"When going to the offices of CBRE,  the offices are very beautiful and clean and new.  But after working there for over 3 years, the management running the office was absolutely one-sided.  I worked in two different support staff positions, and no one was well compensated.  They treated all of us like we were at the very bottom.  The culture in the office was extremely competitive among the brokers, and tensions were always so high around the office.  Just because this company brought in lots of money, doesn't mean it goes to the right places."
bad,The overall Manager of the account I was on was just winging it.  He nothing about the trades and it was just comical.  HR was contacted several times and they did nothing.
bad,over stretched office hours..you need to work always on Saturday's and Sunday's ...after office hours also.....learning a lot but its a typical indian company ...only in name its MNC
bad,"My experience at CBRE was minimal because my assignment ended after only a month because it was not for me. I worked in Portfolio Services and found the work to be engaging and challenging. You will flourish here if you can keep your head down and minimize socializing, but you will miss out on advancement because that is based on your ability to schmooze. I found that middle management was clueless and rarely offered a helping hand. Training comes from coworkers who are working hard trying to meet their own deadlines, and trying to squeeze in time to show the newbies how to do things."
bad,This place is full of robots who only care about making money and fitting in.  They will step on whoever in order to move up within the company.
bad,"The management of my particular department and my coworkers were great. Having said that, the people we served made working there, on the whole, a complete and utter nightmare. One should not dread having to go to work in a hostile environment and sadly the management of my department did little to stop it. One can call it the pitfalls of working in real estate."
bad,"First I was lied to about salary possibilities by phone recruiter and once offered the job salary was much lower than expected with no increase as requested. Worst paying job I had in six yrs, making $14K less. Would never work in real estate accounting again, even though smaller company very close by offered $15K for same position. CBRE pays horribly and don't expect bonus or yearly raises (a co-worker got a 1% raise after 16 months and that was $370/yr.) People is same positions not always paid the same amt. They tout their incredible training system....you do nothing but listen to videos and train yourself. Your are given accts before training completed! The hardest part of the job is trying to get 10 accounts closed for the month on the same day, but you are NEVER allowed to work OT. Got written up for having to be pd OT; written up for not taking breaks and lunch when I never had the time to eat. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I could say I'm outta here! "
bad,They do contracts with corporations to provide real estate service. When they merged with Crow you had to have been from the Crow side to get any advancement. If you were from the CB side if you had built the world it would have been overlooked for a 30 year old Crow person. They are 100% against older employees. Older is 45.
bad,Wouldn’t waste my time working for this company!! They pretty much allow racism I had controversy at my job with racism and they don’t care for there workers
bad,"the biggest thing about CBRE, no communication with maintenance team,"
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
bad,"It was smart of them to keep the original maintenance crew when assuming the facilities support contract at a southeast Texas hospital, but they promised to review and adjust individual pay rates and titles within a year which soon became two.  It became clear early on that we were unsupported by the other 40-odd-thousand Coldwell Banker employees.  In 4 years, I met a grand total of 8 of them."
bad,"Unfortunately, I ended up at the hospital for about a week and a half from a bad condition. I was pretty much unconsciousness for a couple of days. I could not contact my manager, so my family member did with a doctor's note. During the time I was sick, I received a ""warning letter"" from hr. I tried to call many times. Remember I am ill, and now they are stressing me out with a ""warning letter"" to my email... I did not get any answer about the letter. I came back to work on the first day, I was called to Alliance Director (who was 2-3 weeks new to the position) with my manager and received a warning letter. After that day, they started to mark down al my movements. Remember...I am not 100% recovered yet but felt forced to go back, because of the ""warning letter"" email to my email about possibly losing my job. The micromanaging style was out of control, and it resulted in my health far more worst..."
bad,"CBRE bit off more than they could chew on this contract. Controlling our chief which were union they did nothing. They allowed him to talk bad about every employee and manager. Nobody does anything about the chiefs manager skills. "
bad,1st shift is amazing also work hours however job is unorganized. Supervisor do not know the job. Never worked for a company where two site and all three shifts do not work together. Pay is not good for the work load that is processed on a daily bases.
bad,"I have worked at 4 different accounts during 12 years with the company. The first 2 accounts were good but after Hurricane Ike, the company changed the insurance costs out of pocket to more than  triple of what it had been and the benefits went down hill after that."
bad,"I enjoy working for CBRE, but job security is an issue. Our contract was terminated out of the blue. But the site management, and the CBRE management was great."
bad,"My co-workers were very serious about their responsibilities and focused on providing accurate, timely information and reports. I learned a lot about new software and new supporting excel reports that provided excellent documentation. Every day was busy from beginning to end. The team that I was a part of was understaffed for all of the responsibility placed on it. There was too much required of every member in the amount of time that was available. The team management was too focused on the time allotted for each function to take into account when the out of the ordinary requests came in or when there were issues within everyday functions. There was no flexibility and ""your fault"" or ""your problem"" were common responses to requests for assistance."
bad,Employees who are not your boss try to handle situations that they aren’t paid to handle when it comes to other employees instead of letting management handle them.
bad,"Happened to work with inexperienced controller with no manners at all levels of communication. Works seemed to get done with constant inaccuracy and unprecedented ignorance with accepting mistakes and complete luck  of politeness. Not pleasant attitude to deal with, had better and more helpful contractors in a past. Avoid."
bad,HR policies non existent so at tech manager level it is hard to hold techs accountable for anything. Company grew to fast into cometely new business unit with equipment maintenance managenent. Needs to do better job also of screening people for tech positions becauae they hire a lot of bad or no technical skilled people for equipment hands on positions and which makes a lot of work for Managers that have to manage those unskilled people.
bad,"The 2nd manager I got after the stores were realigned was a total jerk, stay away from this company if you want a long time career. If you get the wrong manager on your account you will not like it there at all."
bad,"You are not recognised for hardwork. Senior management like to have favourites and if your not one then this is visible."
bad,"it is a contract position and I am seeking full time, not contract work."
bad,"I didn't work there long enough to give it a good or bad rating"
bad,"This is not the place to work if you are opinionated."
bad,I enjoyed the challenges working for CBRE. My biggest complaint is that there is no job security. If CBRE loses the contract supporting a company then everyone supporting that account loses employment.
bad,"If you’re straight out of highschool with no college experience/degree then the business services department is a good fit for you. Basically, all day you do favors for your supervisor and any type of problem or need that an accountant has. Does not require much intelligence."
bad,"Horrible management, people were very standoff-ish.  On more than one occasion I arrived to work, said good morning and received no response.  Very passive aggressive team."
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
bad,"Directors are too busy to invest time into developing talent, as a result there is a very high turnover rate. A lot of talk is made of improvement but very little changes. The staff is overworked until they burnout. The hiring and promotion process is extremely flawed and mostly driven by nepotism. Positions are largely reserved for the relatives of Brokers, children of potential clients and industry friends. At first glace it seems like a great opportunity but once on board it feels like a sinking ship. It is difficult to maintain client satisfaction without sacrificing a significant amount of family time. Several team members suffer from stress related health issues. The fee earned on most projects are very low, so management under report the amount of hours it takes to effectively run a project.  Most hires don't stick around for longer than a year or so. Just not enough support to be successful here. It's a great team, and a great company but the goods out weight the bad."
bad,"CBRE IS a Great company to work for with great benefits, but the Holland Ohio location is very bad, poor management, big ego's, know it all's and a unhealthy building to be in."
bad,"Chaos = cash. Completely  unorganized and embarrassing.  They're very Americanized management calls countless meetings to pat each other on the back while insulting and degrading the other employees, the ""Safety guy"" is a absolute moron who has no clue what hes doing, he routinely makes false accusations and throws employees under the bus in hopes of getting hired on with ESSO. I have been in the oil and Gas industry for 25+ years I have never witnessed such blatant stupidity and incompetence. Management attacks workers for not reporting ""enough near losses"". Safety guy will altar legal documents, management is fully aware but turns a blind eye.  Easily in the top 2 of ""worst companies I've ever worked for""."
bad,Very customer organized to a fault. CBRE is only interested in customer not their employees at AMazon Fulfillment center. They offer a nice package and pay but they don’t hire experience so your job is extremely harder to do.
bad,"70 Hour work weeks / micro manager boss / 4-6 hours of conference calls daily / no social life / unhealthy expectations from superior / etc, etc, etc, etc"
bad,I worked for CBRE for only 3 months too long. I took the job thinking commercial would better my career. Wrong! Got written up for crazy things! I had my email font in wrong color and made a smiley face. Boss got written up for laughing too loud which disturbed salesmen. Sharks! Cubicles. No talking or radios aloud. Too many bosses too count!
bad,Management was a joke. They treated their maintenance staff very poorly. Little to no communication. No room to grow. The most enjoyable part of working there was the day I left.
bad,"Mi experiencia en ésta empresa fue un poco decepcionante.  Se hicieron dos grupos, los que eran indefinidos y los que teníamos contrato temporal.  Peor experiencia laboral que he tenido en mi vida."
bad,"Accounted for real estate properties with multiple buildings and properties. Prepared monthly statements, interacted with the property managers to get correct accounting information."
bad,I think employees are over worked and they require standard 40hrs and no overtime. This leads to employees conflict with hours and the job requirement.
bad,Stay away from that building... Unless you like getting CUSSED at and belittled
bad,An OK please to work some of the poeple were good to work with but it was a challenging environment.
bad,Ambiente lavorativo stimolante ed ottima conoscenza lavorativa interna
bad,The Industry is great never really a down time. That being said if you have a family I would say this job is not for you. The pay is commission based the sales cycles are extremely long 6 to 8 months at best. I would get in around 8 AM in he morning and leave around 9 or 10 PM at night and I wasn't being paid to do so. I personally would not recommend this place to work for.
bad,Culture of the organization has changed over the last few years and individual contributors are seen more as a commodity than a person.  Unfortunately there is more value in you being in your seat 5 days a week than what you are able to deliver.  The IT organization has become a sweatshop.
bad,"Quieren aparentar ser modernos con el diseño del espacio y ""nuevos métodos de trabajo"", pero sigue siendo una empresa de mentalidad antigua. "
bad,The most negative place I have ever worked for.  No regard for employee moral.  Negative working environment is encouraged by all levels of management.  Job accepted due to no other job being available at time.  Job quit with out having a position accepted else where because positive work ethic is very poorly accepted by management.
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
bad,I met some very good friends here but I work for a paycheck and not friends.  I feel like this company does not care about any of their employees unless you are upper management or a broker.
bad,"The working culture is not good  in CBRE ,they only depend on the Client feedback,their is no support from the company at different circumstances to employee."
bad,"Productive but not fun workplace, processisng pmts, print chqs, log. Electronic wire transfer, working with different systems"
bad,Very hard place to work. The property manager do not have your back. I would not work here again. There was very little leadership with the lower to middle management.
bad,"I found it to be a very elitist organisation who employed inexperienced managers who were not trained or given any kind of training to help them in their new positions, which then resulted in terrible management practices."
bad,"no paid holidays, low pay, poor benefits, bad corporate management, communication is not very good and only those with the golden spoon [ kissasses ] get promoted."
bad,"The position I held was at a set of facilities in downtown Houston. Whether or not this set of facilities is the lone lemon, it wasn't reviewed by external/corporate personnel to determine where the lemon individuals might be. The position was of the bait-and-switch variety, the pay is wholly inadequate and far below other employers for the same level of work, and management is corrosive to accomplishing everyday tasks."
bad,"Very pure management, no proper handover or training provided to employees but you will be expected to do work which results high stress and heavy atmosphere in the office. The company is stingy and will not spend a single penny to hire enough staff, so you will be expected to do additional work and stay longer hours. "
bad,I cleaned toilets offices and the surgery every day. I lerned a lot about my suroundings of a busy production factory about hazards of my souroundings.
bad,"Dão mais atenção a sua vestimenta que ao trabalho, fazem terrorismo psicológico e estipulam metas inatingíveis."
bad,"If your face doesn't fit, it can be lonely place to work."
bad,"I'm not sure if it's the account or the nature of the company as a whole, but the lack of communication is stifling. Safety is not a top priority in practice just in talk. We've asked for safety equipment to handle live electrical equipment and still don't have it available to be used."
bad,Be sure that you have your ducks in a row depending on where you land you may be walking right back out. Office is nice but this company seems to always be reacting to situations instead of taking prventative initiatives to prepare for the future.
bad,"I was a contractor in CBRE, when I started, I was listen calls for a week and on the next week I was on my own, asking questions to management is useless, they don't even say good morning or hi to you."
bad,"If you play the political game right, you may have a career.  If you don't anger the right person who solely looks out for their own gain, you might have a career.  If you do what is right for the company you will be railroaded out the door!"
bad,"Way too many managers.  Client just impossible to work for.  Tied to a desk. Everyday a different set of instructions from multiple people."
bad,"Houston Market Asset Services very unprofessional. If you are not a Baptist watch out, RISE values enforced from a religious perspective. Asset Services is run very oddly, global standards optional. It’s sad when employees know more about CBRE procedures than directors. No support of staff."
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
bad,"The pay and benefits were great. THat's the only plus about this company. The only reason there were any minority employees was due to an employee transfer from another company. Once the minority employees transferred, they were all let go."
bad,"Cherry picking of jobs, lazy coworkers, impossible tasks due to lack of supplies, and favoritism are not benefits in the workplace. Worked very diligently even under these conditions. My integrity is important to me."
bad,"CBRE is known as the Big Green Machine. The company makes lots of money as they tell us all the time. However in my position, I am underpaid for my amount of pressure, stress & responsibility."
bad,"Depending on who you work for will definitely determine your experience. My experience hasn’t been great since I’ve been there. There’s no diversity and people make you feel like you don’t belong. There’s a huge problem with fairness. The rules do not apply to everyone, which makes things very uncomfortable and frustrating. If you’re a producer, then the carpet is thrown at your feet. If you’re not you are treated horribly."
bad,"CBRE seems like a great place to work. The problem was that I worked at IVI, which was recently acquired by CBRE. The IVI culture was stuffy, cut throat, discriminatory, and hostile. When they weren't meeting their projected revenue gains, my position was excised and I was moved into the Zoning Dept. Here, my talents were not leveraged in the best way, plus, I had to take a 10k salary cut. There was not room for advancement. As such, I left."
bad,Management  was so wishy washy never knew if was doing good at job and job became so militarized in an industry where that mentality does not belong and they always had expectations that could never be met in 8 hr day
bad,Forget about having a personal life. EVP wanted us to work 70-80 hours a week and not have anytime for family or days off. They overload you with accounts and have to be in 10 places at once. Lied about getting me support. I did not take a single day off while I worked there and had to come in at night to do client work since I did CBRE paperwork all day.
bad,The departments were too separated and did not work as a team like it should be or what they tell you in your orientation. You feel pretty isolated and not part of the team as a whole.
bad,"Co workers are great.  Depending on the account that you are in really makes the difference.  CBRE concentrates on upper management, not the team members.  Health Benefits are not great. No advancement. No continuing education program."
bad,"Please see my previous review of this organization.  Even after leaving one city and district, I continued to see many of the same issues in other areas.  The organization is set up to favor producers/brokers and does not provide any training or advancement for support staff."
bad,"Over all not a bad job , a lot of travel time and was misled on duties and at the time they where having problems getting the repair parts to me and causing a back log of work orders and return trips to remote job sites which wasted time."
bad,Rien de plus à ajouter au sujet de cette entreprise. Je ne recommande pas aux personnes à la recherche d'un emploi de postuler chez CBRE.
bad,"Looking for better work environment. Management needs more training. Manager micro manages employees too much, causing a few to quit or be terminated recently. Could be a great place to work but has the wrong people in charge with not enough experience."
bad,"Manage the operation and maintenance for buildings, grounds, and manufacturing machinery at the facility."
bad,No one can make a decision -- Management is top heavy -- Not resourced appropriately.
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
bad,"My position title was Technician III. My daily duties were to monitor  the physical plant & respond to demand / preventative work orders. The work order system was poor at best but with a great emphasis placed on work order completions (merit based raises) . Every aspect of your job requires utilizing a computer based program with little to no training and no one locally to assist you. Payroll usually contained errors that were very time consuming on your part and very difficult to correct. My time there was very stressful due to the lack of support from management. These things I consider to be the positive aspects of the job. Promotions are arbitrary, personnel with less experience, less time are promoted and when questioned, management is mute no explanation necessary. I would not encourage any I know to work for them."
bad,O aprendizado é continuo em cada área. Não é uma empresa que tem muita rotatividade mesmo tendo pessoas trabalhando diretamente em contratos e fora da sede.
bad,Depends on what work site you go to. I would be careful as you may do well or strike out. It is like gambling you win and lose sometimes.  Great opportunities. Good benefits.
bad,"CBRE brokerage is a tough area. I was not on full commission so I was at the mercy of broker-treatment. Some of them are really cocky, it's strange.  People don't really like each other at CBRE, it's very tense and noticeable that people are unhappy at CBRE. The economy of CBRE is largely what makes for awkwardness on occasion and discomfort over status.  It's ""fratty"" among the young people. Not recommended for ""good"" souls.  Not that cool of a place unless you have been with company for 10+ years."
bad,Depends on what work site you go to. I would be careful as you may do well or strike out. It is like gambling you win and lose sometimes.  Great opportunities. Good benefits.
bad,"It's all about the client. "
bad,Does not care about people.  Corporate values are mere words on paper.  Never trust anyone.  Medical benefits are a joke. Leaders treat employees like pencils ... use them until they break then discard them
bad,"Não indico de forma nenhuma. Gerencia totalmente despreparada."
bad,"Poor management and the whole company is lacking communication. You do get free lunches and decent pay, but overall the management all the way up is not good."
bad,Zero work life balance with no opportunity to grow within the account. CBRE works there project managers into the ground and expects a minimum of 60 hours a week with little pay.
bad,Overall lack of support from management to staff. Poorly managed office environment that leaves room for staff being over worked and taken advantage of by producers and brokers.
bad,"They never live up to what they say. They ask you what schedule you want, but never give you the schedule you asked for. They show favoritism. Management is awful and lazy. Very unprofessional. No work-life balance. I stressed to them how important it is for me to go to church and they seemed like they was genuine and said they will work with me. But didn't."
bad,"There are a lot of resources and there are always challenges.  Every day is something different. My team is great and I enjoy working with them.  However, it is easy to get burnt out and over stressed."
bad,"Very Busy, and on call 24 - 7 even if your on vacation. You are expected to answer your phone at all times, no matter what. People have been fired for not answering their phone, and you don't get paid for being on call either."
bad,"No growth opportunity. Below market pay, but good benefits. My account: Test book micro-management. Great place to work at if you are afraid to share constructive ideas to improve the business. VERY set in their ways."
bad,"After so many years with this company, there isn't a place to move forward, salary doesn't fluctuate. Very cut throat and working environment isn't what it used to be."
bad,"I was not happy with my job experience at CBRE. Managers were judging your work unfairly, very little time off, poor benefits, not the greatest culture. I would not recommend this company to a friend."
bad,"CBRE is driven by numbers and what the customer allows them to have. Constantly under pressure to cut one month, then spend the next. There was never a feeling of security, my manager constantly talked about layoffs. Hard to stay motivated when people are being cut."
bad,"Management could have been better, would not recommend to anyone who is new to the support industry in IT. Management set the tone for everyone there.Had daily meetings to brief everyone on what the previous day had generated in business."
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
bad,"very poor management and don't care about there maintenance staff and hired to do maintenance and then started moving furniture everyday, then from there it went down hill saying its going to taken care of by a contractor and it wasn't,"
bad,"Due to management's lack of knowledge of AP it creates a domino affect on the processors. Pointing the finger to whomever made the mistake when the accounting software is open to anyone making changes or creating errors. Lack consistency, team players, processors are mixed with a few knowledgeable and the majority confused/don't understand which leads to constantly asking questions and not knowing what to do on a daily basis or how to deal with problems/issues in a effective manner."
bad,"I know of some people who enjoyed working here, but most of the people I worked with didn't. We had ungodly amounts of employee turnover and struggled to fill vacancies despite being a premier employer in the area. I personally was the victim of workplace harassment from senior leadership. Apply at your own risk."
bad,"When I first started at CBRE, my manager was well liked and the environment was one in which I could flourish. My manager left to go to a competitor, and there was a massive shift in authority. Managers are constantly trying to out-do each other, and sacrifice the respect of their employees to do so. PTO is accrued (you can accrue up to 15 days per year, but only a bit over 1/2 a day is accrued per paycheck) - essentially it takes 5 months to accrue 5 days off. This includes sick days. Hourly employees cannot work from home regardless of circumstance. The most enjoyable part of the job was support from my colleagues, and the most difficult was the lack of support about complete apathy of management towards employee satisfaction."
bad,"Management is none existent here, pushed through breaks and lunches to complete work, constant sense of emergency. Work family balance is stressful, pay is average, company does not want to pay for overtime but forces to work it. I would not recommend this company to anyone."
bad,"Capital Market's employee here - "
bad,in fairness only just transferred into this company and on a dedicated contract so I know theirs a different culture but from my experience not so good
bad,"Work environment at CBRE was very welcoming at first glance, however once you experience a problem with management then it  becomes a pretty hostile and unfriendly place to work."
bad,Opportunity to express ideas and concerns. Room for growth. Great understanding of how facilities management works. Concierge management is great. Co-Workers are great. Great opportunity to network and meet new people within the Towers.
bad,"Over worked and under staffed "
bad,Managers are not very understanding of employees with outside interests and/or families.  Difficult to maintain a healthy work/life balance.  Compensation and benefits are horrible for support staff.
bad,All decisions are made by a handful of directors in Client Accounting Services. Benchmarks are not realistic. You will burn out.
bad,"Hi stress environment and as stated in other posts, upper management talks, but does not walk, the program, because they have no experience managing their specific disciplines. Ethical issues abound to make profits. Typical managing directors return to the production side because of no executive corp. support."
bad,Employees work crazy hours during month end close. it is a generally knowledge that all Senior Accountant work overtime during the month end and no one is allowed to take time off
bad,"I've seen two mobilisations with CBRE, and on 'go live' days, the organisation was a mess. "
bad,"Working 55-65 hours a week at a minimum"
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
bad,"It's a good place to start your career, but if you want to be fairly compensated for your position, you need to look elsewhere.  They started time tracking - by the minute - so they micro-manage.  They claim their ""perks"" offset them able to pay lower wages - so people are leaving the company left and right.  They struggle to maintain top talent and recruit good talent.  Most people don't stay beyond 5 years."
bad,Upper management does not care about employees. All they care about is meeting their numbers at the expense of their employees stress level and lack of work life balance. Allowing upper management to scream and yell at direct reports when they don’t hear what they want to hear. Crazy environment.
bad,"They will turn on you in a heartbeat it starts fine then goes downhill after that, they watch every move you make on the job or at home. One mistake expect to be sent down the road. Dishonest to a T."
bad,"We had to work very long hours, Management was not professional. there was a lot of yelling. no salary increase for the employees until after a year. not a good place to work for"
bad,"Its a pretty cool place to work at but the manager is very unprofessional and micro manages everything you do.  You have to ask to go to the bathroom.  If you pick up your cell to even see what time it is, she'll almost scream at you to put your phone away.  I hate working here only because of management."
bad,Mobile building Engineer Wells Fargo account Las Vegas horrible job double standard managers sleep while I stress 24/7 on call slave driving !!!  And no help 10 buildings by myself !!!
bad,"The Senior Vice President hired people from her old company for positions that never existed and then changed the direction of the department. Not saying this was bad, but the employees who were there before she arrived are not valued at all."
bad,"Lack of training when I first started, had to learn on my own.  Promotion opportunity was based on favoritism, and not on actual experience for the job.  Inexperienced new manager then created hostile work environment."
bad,"mi trabajo no era evaluado por quien debería de ser evaluado; si no por gente que sólo estaba en el puesto por hablar bien y ser amigo de alguien que se lleva bien con gerente."
bad,"We work long hours because of not enough staffing  . The  raises ,and promotions  are giving on  who you know not always on what you know or how well you do the job."
bad,"If you're someone who talks the talks but cannot walk the walk then CBRE is the place for you. High Turnover, very political, people behaving very immaturely. Sometimes I feel they are just winging it. A big company that functions like a small one and has no clear direction. Poor healthcare benefits. Employees don't adhere to they RISE values."
bad,"The manager who hired me know that I did not have all of the skills to do the job, but assured me that she would train me and work with me.  I have the accounting skills, but she really never took me under her wing.  I do not know if there was a personality clash or what.  We just never connected."
bad,"Typical day includes 2-5 conference calls per day, clearing paperwork and gathering information for (4) facilities for a multitude of projects that exponentially increase, continuously plan facility maintenance 8 weeks in advance, and maintain nearly 200,000 sq. ft. facility singlehandedly. Not enough staffing or hours in a day that the salary and benefits can justify."
bad,"i didn't like the manager i was reporting, Very harrasing and work culture was not good."
bad,"jci/adient management with no backbone completely controlled by the union."
bad,"CBRE was my employer, but my job was somewhat unusual in that all of my duties were dictated by the hospital organization we were contracted with to manage their environmental services/staff.  We were treated as outsiders, and it was very difficult to get anything accomplished to the hospital organizations ""satisfaction"" as communications were often tense, slow and ineffective.  I was told that working independently for CBRE was a far different experience."
bad,"The work load is based off a point system. However, I have had more than one property that was way under pointed. The workload stays strong, when you loose one, you get another one. If you have a family, this place is not for you. Managers do not understand why you need to leave and pickup your kids from daycare at the end of the day. Long days for accountants and even longer for Sr accountants and managers who work all nights plus all weekend long. Horrible turn around based on over load of work, unrealistic deadlines, and high stress."
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
bad,I would check my work orders and decide what were the most pressing.  At that point I would travel to the appropriate location to complete the work needed.  I would repeat this process until all work orders were complete.  I felt the upper management were disconnected from anything that was happening at the hands on level.  There was nothing hard about this position.  The most enjoyable part was the minimal supervision.
bad,"Many CBRE accounts have great Alliance Directors, and many have uncaring single agenda ADs (keeping their own job). I had the chance to be on both. It takes an AD who really values  people and wants to do things the right way to make this a great place to work. On my first account, Peter was fantastic and managed the needs of the client with finesse - he had great relationships with the Client because he cared and viewed the relationship as two way. He also worked very hard each day to grow those relationships. He would say no when appropriate. My last AD, Steve, could care less about people (others had formal complaints against him) and was a 'yes' - never really caring about his own people or the client. The relationship was entirely one way, whatever the Client said he agreed with, regardless of the short term or long term implications. It continues to be a disaster. No one cares about each other. Just earning a paycheck, hence the title of this review. I hate mercenary environments. Everyone doing their own thing, just satisfying a checkmark box. A great deal of email managers. If you are considering CBRE, ask a lot of questions about how problems are handled with the Client, ask for examples of CBRE saying no, responses to maintaining and growing relationships, the quality of those relationships, and how often team members meet outside of normal office hours."
bad,"There are some good people working there, but there are some that break rules on a regular basis with absolutely no consequences simply due to the fact that they've been there awhile, or the bosses like them. Some that do next to nothing but nearly double their annual wage because they're allowed insane amounts of overtime to basically come in joke around, watch you tube videos or hide. This same employee is always allowed first shot at any weekend overtime, even though he has a habit of just not showing up about 20% of the time and even had the audacity to laugh about all of the extra money he makes, just for showing up."
bad,"I knew too much and felt that the establishment for conforming the laborers to a strict ""censorship"" way of life."
bad,"Good in project management coordination, but salary is extremely poor as compared at par with other industry standards."
bad,"As a company CBRE provides excellent employee packages and incentives. But management lacks the ability to communicate with the employees what is needed to conplete work assignements. Every project is a rush and you are pretty much on your own to solve issues. They are ""Penny wise and pound foolish"" when it comes to making decisions about selecting their workforce and providing needed training. ."
bad,its a good company but limited advancement and career path development
bad,"Loved my female co-workers. Brokers, on the other hand, were always MIA (had to cover for them), wanted things last minute, and one even deleted half of our REA database (he says ""by accident""), which I had to re-create from scratch. When I reviewed a newsletter that was approved to go out, I found typos, incorrect stats, etc. I had marketing re-do. Due to the delay, I was blamed. They'd rather get things done quick than do it correctly. They also stole clients from other firms. I was fired after 10 months of doing a good job....probably because I knew too much of what was going on behind the scenes."
bad,"The Freeport office was shut down there and it was the best thing that ever happened to me, My asst. controller was weak and didn't even show up on my last day. Run far away from this company they pay low and hire pretty much any uneducated person to worek there. Happy I got laid off i went from making 35k to 52k in my next job with way better people."
bad,No job security. Management plays favorites. Not good pay. They dismiss the customer and do what they think is right instead of what the customer wants
bad,"I learned alot while working for CBRE and would've stayed if management was better.  Despite my colleagues and I trying to do our best, it appeared management tried to make our lives miserable, due to the micro-management, and  condescending tones."
bad,"I have left over a month ago and still awaiting my P45."
bad,"Nothing to learn new things, but reporting structure is very useless, no proper monitoring, the reporting people should be role model but , i feel very strong that the reporting should be repsective"
bad,"The company states everyone build each other up so all are valued. Not so, members of teams discourage new members from being engaged with fresh ideas, and current work methods by using passive aggressive tactics."
bad,"Ever increasing duties, responsibilities, & pressure of work. Whilst receiving very little apreciation & value as an employee, from local management, right up to Area General Management."
bad,Poor management.. only out for the brokers not the support people. Through you under the bus in a heartbeat if a broker wanted it. No advancement for women. You stay in the same position for as long as you are there.
bad,"hormis les tours mercuriales bien amianté, le groupe cbre est un bon groupe sauf pour les formations et la mise en immersion professionnelle qui laisse à désiré et enfin certaines assistantes qui arrivent comme des fleurs et comme si de rien était.....  un peu une secte ou chacun fait ce qu'il veux...... l'aspect le plus difficile les turns overs et le burn out"
bad,"If you work at CBRE, you should expect for CBRE to dominate your life.  Extremely cut-throat and not a pleasant place to work. Human resource issues were not handled confidentially.  Not recommended."
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
bad,Told we were free to run our portfolio as it needed to be. We then would be verbally or emailed and told it was all wrong. Told I couldn’t be trusted because of one error. No opportunity to correct error or defend oneself. I think this could have been a perfect fit but the manager micro managed your every move. They also lied about providing training and being there to help. The manager was not willing to help their staff be successful. Worst manager I have ever worked for.
bad,"Horrible Management and IT Department.  "
bad,"Pros"
bad,Do not take a job with this company. They promise you the moon and do not deliver. They promise training but after you hire on they they say is no money in the budget. Engineers have no bonus but supervisors and managers get theirs. All they want are stupid engineers and then keep them that way so they don't have to pay much money. The supervisors want to lord over you just to find something negative while never giving you credit for anything positive. All the while they could care less about the properties they are suppose to take care of!  Don't make the mistake with this company. Look somewhere else.
bad,Company not structured and staffed to address needs of clients causing miscommunication internally and committing to deliverables that are unattainable.
bad,Advice to management is invest in your employees. Felt over worked at times. The manager was very brutal with her demands regarding datelines. They give you more properties and expect you to meet every dateline no exception.
bad,"Hard Core work at worksite. According to work, low salary very offered & very low  increment even after one year. No job security if the projects are not lasts . Management is fine.Job culture is also good."
bad,If you haven't heard theres a new sheriff in town and its name is CBRE. This multi billion dollar company has no perks for employees. this would work if you were a  mom and pop shop but you demand your employees blood sweat and occasionally tears to cut every corner possible. you not only over promise but under deliver.
bad,"Great overall office Culture,  Your experience will truly depend on the account you work for and the Manager you have.  Some Managers are out of touch with the Finance piece of the account and truly do not understand it,  This makes for a not so Pleasants experience.  It is hard to say what they reward as far as performance."
bad,The company was not a good place to work. When I started working there it was OK. Later it became a bad place to work when brought in a new manager for my department. My supervisor was a good person to work for but the manager of the department was terrible to work for.
bad,"The training sucks and they throw you in with a very limited amount of training.  They simply don't care unless you are a ""favorite child"" of theirs. Really bad experience."
bad,"Not all the CBRE offices are using the new open concept floor plans.  Especially if you are working as a third party contractor.   If you are considering working there.  Make sure the environment you are to work in is the beautiful space you interviewed in.   You may just end up in a dark and basement like environment.   "
bad,"I was very encouraged when CBRE took over management of the facility where I worked. We were presented with lots of good ideas about preventative maintenance and consistency in inventory sourcing. I worked for them for two years and not a single one of those innovations was implemented. In that time, we had 5 managers and 3 HR reps come & go and (including me) 6 mechanics left for better prospects elsewhere."
bad,Compensation/Benefits comparable with competitiors. Training and education encouraged and supported.   Management and job culture did not reflect company's values.  Limited growth and contributions due to procedures.
bad,"Working 24/7 365 days a year."
bad,If you can't handle stress or being in a fast paced environment than this is not for you.  The bosses did not try to relieve the co-workers who were causing problems or stress in the environment
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
bad,"CBRE is not a company you want to work for long term.  The culture is great but the pay and benefits are not very good.  Very, Very fast pace and very stressful in that it is the bad type of stress that affects your health."
bad,"It really depends what team you're on I think. My manager played favorites with anyone who kissed up to her. The environment is very toxic and almost everyday my manager would gossip about everyone on the team in a negative way. There is no clear direction on anything because either 1. No one knows exactly what they're doing or 2. They don't want to train you. The company values are great but the employees, HR, and environment doesn't match. It's all about favorites and who you know pretty much. If you went to school with someone in HR, you get hired on full-time regardless of experience or academics. Like I said, all about who you know"
bad,"Nepotism and incompetent leadership/management killed my experience the last year I worked at CBRE. Our manager had no prior experience managing creatives and was more used to being one of the team than running a team. Her boss was teaching her on-the-fly to minimize her leadership weaknesses but wasn't open nor interested in benefitting the team morale due to lack of design leadership."
bad,Management ignores direct issues and is selective in which issues to pursue.  Some wrong-doing enployees are not dealt with and are allowed to continue working dispite numerous complaints.  Another employee was injured by company negligence and was impaired by injury.  CBRE waited till bogus complaint against injured employee to use as an excuse to terminate permanently impaired employee.  Negligence on CBRE swepted under the rug.
bad,"Very hectic environment."
bad,"Everyone wants to be at CBRE. It's not all it's cracked up to be. To many meetings, no actual support - brokers pay for everything. Lack of direction with C-Suite teams, to many not in my job description comments."
bad,"Great company for someone who already has their foot in the door and experience in real estate. Training was non existent and new employees were expected to ""figure it out"" with little guidance from management. Great benefits and atmosphere."
bad,"New team members are thrown into the workplace with little to no training.  Expectations are unreasonably high from day 1.  Mundane data gathering tasks are consistently given to team with very short due dates.  This makes it almost impossible to complete the required duties of the job.  Regional Directors seem to be more interested in protecting their own existence instead of leading and encouraging their team.  24/7 work week required to even come close to meeting the expectation.  If you are not meeting the standard there is no help from above...only criticism."
bad,"was fun while it lasted, good work, and some good people. Bad management skills with some.great benefits."
bad,Job description when I applied for the job was different than the interview I went on.  Ended up in a job I had no experience for.  Found the job extremely boring with people that had bad attitudes.  Supervisor seemed to be overwhelmed with his position.  Very high demands on an under staffed department.
bad,"This is a company that provides a wide variety of employment opportunities on a worldwide basis. Given the large size of the company, you have multiple opportunities to learn new skills."
bad,"I joined CBRE as they offered me a good salary hike. While the company is very professional, the culture is boring and gets depressing over time. The is a powerful cultural hierarchy."
bad,"Research Manager is top-notch. Can't say enough positive things about their willingness to go-to-bat for their staff."
bad,"The account I worked on was volume driven, which allowed me to get a firm understanding on the ""ins and outs"" of the industry as a whole. Management was ineffective at motivating their team. Keeping up with the pace of work was the most challenging part of this job."
bad,Too many hours expected of people and during weekends too. Never been in a job where passive aggressively manager expects so much that some people go off sick (Finance). The real problem is that the team is understaffed and it's expected other members take on the responsibility and overtime.
bad,Not very experienced management; gender/age preferences; not many opportunities to grow at least on the account I worked at.
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
bad,Organizational structure is ever changing or non-existent. Lack of management of employees (example: annual reviews are always completed months behind and goals offered cannot be achieved in that time frame). No interest in development of employee career growth by manager. Managers manage projects and not the people under them. It's very unfortunate.
bad,"Overtime was expected but you were not paid for it. You weren't allowed to leave until everyone had reports submitted to management."
bad,"This company is corporate all the way to the top. Can be hard to work up the ranks, lower entry and mid-level salaries, expectations and the amount of responsibilities can become overwhelming."
bad,No structure or training.....several incomplete task give to people. Left alone to figure things out...and if any mistakes are made you will be blamed for everything even if its not your fault.
bad,I like the building. nice place to work just needed a new job. I just did not like the people that were at the building
bad,"I come in everyday at 8 and I don't do anything until 12pm. It's unbearably boring. However, work piles up unexpectedly and managers are unreasonable about deadlines. High stress environment. I don't get paid enough for what I do."
bad,It was only a few months of accounting help to get through their busy time.
bad,"Was let go for no reason when new management stepped in. Asked for specific details and new manager failed to produce any and gave the run around. No room for advancement or training in other departments, even after multiple requests and hard work. Overall moral was severely decreased with new management. Great people to work with, great site."
bad,"Very bad management"
bad,I was not at CBRE long enough to answer this question. Overall the people was great but not enough training to really get an understanding of what your day to day would be.
bad,"CBRE itself is a great company to work for with great benefits, as long as you are on a team with effective leadership. Otherwise, it is a very frustrating experience."
bad,I have nothing to say right now about CBRE. We lost the bid at Humana and will be cw soon. been here three years and never had a raise. CBRE has no work in the Louisville at this time.
good,"Customer Service, property management company at a medical facility.  Small office environment, fast paced office work. Interesting field of work with"
good,work you till your expendable then they want to try to get you to leave thru difficult working conditions. Under pay by as much as 25% for same position else where.
good,A typical day at work was to walk up and down 50 flights of stairs and over 25 floors. I learned how to be very scrupulous in my behavior at a workplace because of the hostile work environment.
good,Very politically driven.  Needs a better mentoring program and on the job training.  Very little guidance is provided to new employees or new services which is not serving the client.
good,"Corporate culture is not reflected in this region's management. Training is poor, three managers in 3 years. Too many egos to satisfy. Region management has changed drastically for the worse."
good,"Manuseio de Injetora, Atividades logísticas, como sequenciamento/travamento de caixas, recebimento/conferência de mercadorias e manuseio de empilhadeira."
good,Nice company but working place is not satisfied. Staffs are doing there jobs non cooperation. Admin team is not good. Employees are not work independently
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
good,"Good company for professional to work, we can explore more work experience in CBRE, team is helpful and supportive. We can get huge knowledge in CBRE."
good,"Work hard, get paid little, go home disappointing and usually mad."
good,The controller who oversees the Financial Manager of Operations position in Memphis Tn lacks knowledge of the area and imposes unreleastic expectations for the position. Please keep this is mind when accepting this position. Sr management supports this controller who overseas this position also even though the controller has been instrumental in replacing 5 out of managers who were performing at achieve or exceed levels. Take caution when accepting this position.
good,Overv all not satisfied. The culture is of yes man. & management people have big egos to be catered to. Or ur career might suffer. Over all I will not recommend CBRE as growth prospect is nil & office politics is very prevalent here.
good,"Work bldg old and nasty and not maintained very well"
good,Lots of work for low wages and expectations are unrealistic in relation to starting out.  I had to fill in for a supervisor/manager and teach them what they needed to be doing.  Upper level Assistant controller overview direct assistance/review was most supportive in learning new and useful practices as well as guided me through specific processes that require complex management.
good,"This company is great, but the site I work for is worst and there is no work life balance at all at any point of time, most irritating facilities and no benefits at all."
good,There was a lot of turnover. Not very loyal to their employees. Other employees were friendly but people typically do not stay there that long. Executives were not that available. Employees are underpaid compared to competitors.
good,"good company, its global you can relocate depending what you do. "
good,I have applied for over 10 transfers in the last 2 years to get out of present job. Not even an interview. Excellent resume an yearly employee surveys. And this company wants me to get ahead? Gimme a break. NO reason to motivate myself.
good,Wasn't paid for 6 weeks after starting. Supplies take too long to receive. Tenants aren't respected and property gets neglected. Management treats employees as inferior.
good,Third party commercial property management gives you the opportunity to work with several commercial property managers. Each have their strengths but a common factor is not hiring an equal but someone that knows less.
good,Not enough time in the day to work efficient with the amount of meetings. High Risk with 50% bandwidth. Third Party employees will never be fully equal to what the requirements are. The is a recipe for failure
good,"I started at CBRE as a temp employee and it turned into a full time job. Unbeknownst to me, that they kept me for over 8 years and let the whole team go except for the manager who was never there but called in to have you do her work."
good,Empresa com pouca oportunidade de crescimento profissional.
good,"I haven't worked there in a long time but had to leave after 9 mos as I couldn't stand my impossible manager and the cut throat management above her. I was not a person just someone to demand this and that, the dress code was professional but to stiff and unnecessary."
good,I worked at CBRE for over a year and there was no forward movement for employees unless you were a broker. 
good,"For the first half of my time at CBRE I really enjoyed myself. It wasn't until later that I started to realize how limiting my position is - not only that but the lack of communication within the company in general makes it hard for anything to get done, or for anyone to be on the same page"
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
good,"I was at Client side at Maersk, so the challenges which I faced at the site, I did not get proper support from my manager and there was no job security as Maersk was reviewing the contract for renewal"
good,This was a contract job with the bank and you really never knew who was in charge the bank or the company....this was an admin role that was doing construction projects.
good,"On the switchboard all day whilst doing paperwork, co workers are fantastic, long hours are the hardest thing about the job, most enjoyable part I get to interact with all different levels of employees."
good,"It is hard to get motivate to come to work everyday for this company. In the department I work in we haven't been properly staffed for more than two years. Managers and Supervisor will listen to you and disregard any of your ideas to make it a better work environment. Many will tell you it's even hostile."
good,"I applied @ cbre  with a vision of it being a better environment to work in. The supervisors are difficult to contact despite their claims to be hands on. They contradicted themselves so often, it was hard to know what to do and when to do it as they changed the rules frequently. They don’t value their employees or their clients, they only value their contracts & the $$ that they generate. They are a “cliquish” Corp. and also borderline bigoted. They exhibit their tokenism by  presenting a type of   diversity (in name only),  to their global clients."
good,Good company overall but it depends on the team you are on and who your manager is. They hire in low and promote. Political environment. No clear career path. Most people are in the same job for years before being promoted if ever. Raises are 2%. Meducal is standard.
good,"Ótima empresa para se desenvolver habilidades de gerenciamento de pessoas e aprender a solucionar problemas complexos."
good,"nie ma żadnych możliwości rozwoju, nie ma szkoleń, wyzysk pracownika"
good,"Its a big company you a re a number so you have to shine or be not in the loop."
good,All work is done by the CMMS program and done by numbers. It is encouraged to mislead and lie that work is getting done to meet required agreement with customer. Find yourself doing more paperwork than working your skilled labor
good,Never ending service calls for stupid students. Responsable for 11 million dollar upgrades to HVAC system without proper compensation or respect. Management talks all credit for my hard work.
good,it is a environment that has a fine line between what  the client wanted and what cbre would allow. the management on the account i was on and a very high rate of turn over. this led to a lot of confusion putting us as techs to satisfy the client.
good,"burned out,no chance for advancement,lack of transparency, management is self focused on its own agenda, there is lack of training and understanding of job roles,"
good,They wanted the workers to do a lot but did not always provide them with the proper supplies or man power. Overall it was a job that gave you your 40 he's a week.
good,"don't tell you how things should get done, then pull you up on it when it goes Wong "
good,CBRE became my employer through a corporate acquisition. I personally was very satisfied until placed under my current manager who has a history of difficulties with subordinates and clients and continues to add to it. So I say enter at your own risk. I'm certain it can be a great place to be. However like anywhere there are poor managers waiting to darken your time working for them.
good,This was a decent job all the way up until they decided to do a round of huge layoffs because they didn’t have enough money to pay there employees. Very disappointed in the way they conducted layoffs.
good,"they want you to shut up, keep your head down and be a work horse who is happy to work weekends and long hours and have zero life outside of work. if your'e a women, you will first be judged on your appearance then your skill set. They hire based on looks first. zero female executives at our headquarters. go to CBRE and skip CBRE global Investors"
good,"You can improve your skills and knowledge base due to the monthly safety training's and online classes that are required. If you are employed at a client based facility, it is a great opportunity to improve your customer service skills."
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
good,"poor man management no support just criticism, poor health and safety on the surface good but in reality bad, management constantly lie to customers to appear to be compliant"
good,"The old saying "" Too many cooks in the kitchen , make for a BAD meal "" ....You are a number with CBRE......they truly don't care about your opinion or any thing you might suggest !!! Awful company for advancement , in my estimation ! I wish REIT would have stayed as Building managers....they were AWESOME !!!"
good,No real thrills or personality. Everyone comes to work outs their heads down and barely socialize. If you are an introvert this may still be a little too dead for you but they pay okay and it's stable
good,"A typical day is minimum of 10 hours of work."
good,If you don't fit in they will make sure thats a terrible work environment to make you make you quit. Worked there for 9 months and it was a very cutthroat company.
good,"CBRE upper Management does NOT treat the employee with respect .....always talked down to, always given last minute errands to run out of the building????? Not the job of a Building Maintenance person..."
good,"Tuped to business and left to struggle."
good,"Go in, get your work done, leave. No excitement what so ever. Advancement in the company might take a while. Having a good Corporate culture doesn't seem so important here."
good,"Currently, I work as a contracted business services clerk for a major pharmacies distributor. All shipping and receiving duties is combined with facilities duties."
good,"a typical day at work started with the thought "" I wonder if we'll hear from CBRE today"". Being as we we're on client account we rarely heard from our CBRE manager it was like we were dropped in a distant land and told make something grow. I never felt I was a part of the company more that I was apart from. the hardest part of the job for me was seeing all the training opourtunities offered to those individuals in the real estate side of the company as opposed to those individuals in technical services side."
good,CBRE is too middle managment heavy and too worker bee light.  My direct manager is great to work for and she provides excellent communication.
good,It all depends on which office you are assigned to.  Some are fantastic others... not so much.  But there is little to no oversight of management.
good,"terrible job tranfer results unorganized managment , fun place to work."
good,"CBRE as a whole is a large company however my experience is only at one facility. My experience has not been very positive other than the pay, but I can not apply this review to the entire company as a whole based on this one facility. "
good,"I have learn t a much working with this company, which will help me in growing in my future."
good,Advancement opportunities are limited. There is nothing else I want to say. Why are you making me type more?  There is nothing I want to add here. I am done with this section. Please don't make me write more.
good,Management needs to communicate better with employees.  CBRE is going through many changes and has not been able to communicate all those changes to their employees.
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
good,"Management reviews are not fair to staff and can be judgmental at times. Micro management was an understatement. Very harsh at times towards me, but I did my job always stayed in compliance of all work ."
good,"Company does use advanced technology but seems to lack change managers who are willing to help the company go through change. Top heavy management who seem to be focussed on budgets and ""how good they look"" verses what is best for the company"
good,"Co-workers were good to work with and very good facilities. Work wasn't always challenging, but had good benefits. Upper management cared for the brokers and the rest of us were just an expense to them. They took back all the contributions from my 401(k) when they laid me off. So they kicked me while I was down."
good,Do your job at a top heavy company and get the boot when they loose contracts due to out pricing their services to pay for Golden parachutes at the executive levels.
good,"My duties at the Cigna building included, but not limited to maintenance and repair to the chillers and variable speed pumps that supplied chilled water to the air handlers. Maintenance and service to two Cleaver Brooks industrial boilers. Boilers needed to be blown down and tubes periodically needed to be cleaned. The condensate pumps that returned the condensed water back to the boilers were also inspected daily."
good,"Everything you'd expect from a typical corporate environment, some friendly people, nice coffee break room, quiet cube and office work spaces, assorted mini meeting & large conference rooms, clients coming and going, lots of glad handing, presentation preparation and paperwork shuffling busy days."
good,"Après de bons moments passés au sein d'un contrat client, tout à dérapé lors de la fin du contrat. Pas de proposition de reclassement, des rh agressifs et désagréables. Une hiérarchie oppressante du jour au lendemain. Après de bonnes années, si ils perdent un contrat vous n'existez plus pour eux."
good,Great experience coming from someone who new exactly were there headed. Learned a lot of what to do and a lot of what not to do. Get stepping stone in my career path.
good,"I do not want to talk about this, As far as building skills CBRE is great place to start your accounting career.  However work life balance is lacking as well good pay."
good,"The first two years at CBRE were fantastic! I loved my manager, my team, and my job. Management has changed sooooo much in the last year or so that the job was no longer enjoyable. I was constantly stressed and micromanaged to the point that it was no longer possible to enjoy my job. "
good,"CBRE has become a paper work place, we spent more time doing paper work than fixing building issues. The company does not have incentives to grow , and there is zero promotion."
good,Work-life balance is challenging.  Opportunity to travel and definitely opportunities to put your stamp in your role.  A lot of things need to be fixed.  You can get recognition for fixing and improving your role.
good,the expected revenue puts a lot of pressure and unhealthy competition amongst project management team.  Workload is another issue that PJM is facing. Hopefully it will change soon.
good,"Work environment was okay but management was really bad. PMO only hires and keep PMs from the VP's nationality.  What do you know don't matter, but who do you know and which country you come from really matters.  PMO VP acted like my way or highway."
good,"Didn't feel challenged, coworkers seemed aloof. Hardest part of job was staying awake and reviewing the same types of documents over and over. Boss was nice and understanding whenever I had to miss work for sickness or family loss."
good,"Although as a whole, CBRE may be a good company and employer, I certainly did not experience it in the group I worked in.  Employees were not supported, only continuously criticized and browbeat."
good,"The company gives the intention of being a great place to work, but unfortunately it cares more about it's processes and production than the growth and advancement of employees."
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
good,Nice working for people similar to yourself.  My personnel management is holding me back.  I would have greater opportunity if they were not there.  I am looking for different avenues to take.
good,"My job is varied from day to day, depending on what troubleshooting and repairs within the plant are necessary.  It is a very high energy environment; I maintain all systems in a large distribution center (Amazon).  "
good,Faculty staff and students very professional. Frequent events and distinguished quest coming to the school to offer there expertise and advice to the students.
good,work culture is okay.. only you need to have a good boss to continue and work better. we work 5 days. management is okay. I have learnt to an extent how to be in an MNC company.
good,"Within a 18 month period a manager from Pittsburgh was brought in to personally dissemble an efficient, professional high performing team of 12 people and before I was number 11 I left on  my own accord."
good,"Work comes first at it should, but as they say ""all work and no play makes jack a dull boy""."
good,"a day at work is normal but very less opportunities of grabbing good growth specially the person who is from some technical background,about the management there is no direct interaction with the company's management as being on site direct interact with client, workplace culture is quite OK from my perspective ,the hardest part of work is to manage misunderstanding/misleading/mis confusion leading while in changing shift."
good,"You learn many different types of business practices and processes. Work culture, career advancement and pay needs improvement. Overall I really enjoyed working for the company."
good,"New management came into our local office and completely changed the culture.  There is no chance of promotion or growth unless you want to be a broker which is a non-compensated position.  Also, the company overall is only interested in the bottom line and has grown to be so large that management, human resources, operations, marketing, etc. are all at a national level so there is no human interaction and processes take weeks or months to complete."
good,"Multiple interaction with customers and internal employees, fast pace, very demanding position, and multi-tasking.  "
good,"CBRE is the #1 commercial real estate company in the world. The brand color is green. Management is weak in this company, it is hard to grow in the company if you aren't friends with management."
good,I loved the people I worked with.  This was a good location for me and offered a lot of diversity with job responsibilities.
good,"Very little to no training, you learn as you go. The 8 weeks training class provided for new hires has absolute no use to it yet they expect you to remember everything."
good,I feel there is no room for growth within this company.  After 5 years I saw that no one was ever promoted.  All promotion opportunities are filled from outside the company.
good,"I like my job but the environment is not very friendly since we're co-contractor.  Other maintenance employees think we're there to take over their job., so they wee not very helpful in any way."
good,It's number 1 for a reason! Great company if this is the path you intend to take! So many locations and positions to chose from.
good,"Management on the current contract that I am on, is less than desirable.  Accountability and leadership is poor. Work life balance was very good at the start of the project but had declined within the first 9 months."
good,Run like a machine. If they can eliminate someone they do and there are no feelings at all. It is business and if you can be replaced by a robot- good for the bottom line. Typical worldly view.
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
good,A good company to work for but as a non fee earner you are not rewarded with career progression or support as you would be otherwise.
good,"This is a very boring job, I basically Babysit a building. Every so often there are rounds to make. I'm looking for a job that I can use my talents on."
good,"Rotina Administrativa de um escritório, sempre formal e postura, sempre em prontidão para atender o cliente."
good,"There is no typical day in commercial real estate.  Learned to multi task and be very detail oriented.  The hardest part of the job is the lack of managerial support,"
good,My old manager was Army Reservists and understood the duty of an active military veteran.
good,Company is subject to Customer/account operating practices which could change very quickly
good,"Good starting workplace, with a good starting salary and benefits. Management and workplace culture is behind the times, with favoritism for their sales team and a revolving door of support staff employees. Experience will vary greatly based on the team you work for, but with little to no advancement in salary and pay I would not recommend this workplace for long term career advancement. Do not expect support from management if you are not sales staff, they do not care."
good,Not a company that values its people. You can and will be fired anytime. $$$$ matters people do not. Management is not great all ego. You will work long hours but without recognition or reward. They limit job growth and control your next step so you are doing what they want you to do. One client problem and you are out. Terrible culture.
good,"It was a great place to work at however there is a lack of communication, unorganized, and there was poor management. If I had to do it all over again I would however I would go about things differently."
good,"A lot of great talent and passionate folks, but upper management in technology is too apathetic and/or weak-willed to push back on C-Level folks enough to advocate for the proper technologies & salaries to attract/retain quality resources."
good,"guter Einstieg u  ein Unternehmen kennen zu lernen, aber im Nachhinein hat man sich bisschen ausgenommen gefühlt"
good,"CBRE is a great Company to work for that being said including good paid and benefits. However, it just the team that I had to working with and dealt. One main reason about the team and I with the issue is all about safety. We should all taken safety seriously, but they taking it at a funny thing, when I brought it up, it seems they are going against me and that is the main reason we separated."
good,"This is the perfect work and job culture for Post Grad and Entry Level civilians."
good,Need to be given more referrals and a base salary to get off the ground with the business which is very tough to do. A draw would be nice for the first 6mo's or year to help with business development.
good,"No geral não foi uma empresa boa para se trabalhar. Sem resposta da gerencia, abandono. Sem qualidade de vida"
good,The hardest part of the job is the long hours and your on your feet all day. It is also a very stressful environment to work in. Management is critical of everything you do.
good,You go to get your laptop out of your locker and find an open workstation. There are enough tools and technology for you to learn. Management will favor their own people. CBRE will create a new title instead of promoting you. Cold and isolated work atmosphere.  The sales agent are treated different than support staff. The hardest part of the job is getting bids as vendors knows you're required to get 3 bids so they do not respond to your request. The most enjoyable part of the job is vendor will entertain you to get new business.
good,"CBRE is a good place to work. Good management, good bosses to work with....however, things could have been more structured considering a 25yrs old organization."
good,"Contract under RFP, it doesn't seem that our team will be supported by CBRE beyond the end of the contract which really sucks. We supported you, we should have seen that energy reciprocated. Instead we are marching till the team is dismantled with no clear support beyond the end date."
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
good,"After the last few years it was no longer the job for me. Toxic, stressful, poorly managed and the work moral is poor. If you wish to find a job that will provide growth, advancement, and the ability to be properly groom in your career. Look elsewhere."
good,"From all the places that I have worked, CBRE seems to always be in panic mode.  I personally believe that the responsibility of an individual's work-life balance resides with that individual, if and only if the company pays for the time work exceeding normal business hours. On a scale of 1 to 10 their work-life balance is a 2.  If you are a contractor they expect to work you for 16 hours, pay you 10, and pretend the other 6 hours were voluntary.  If you are a salaried manager, developer or administrator, then you will brag about the fact that you slept 4-6 hours.  You will be overworked, you will not be developed, you will be tired, and you may make one of your child's school events, but they will pay you.  So, if money is a motivator jump in."
good,Hardest part of the job can be a difficult account whereas leadership is naive to the real estate environment and fail to accept the SME experience that CBRE offers with top talent.
good,Did not have a successful team environment and was bored at some points. Other times it was stressful and demanding.Was not a good learning environment either.
good,"I was in Tech Support which is not part of the Main Business. "
good,"CBRE is a great company for Women and if you want to play the corporate game then plenty of opportunity for advancement.  CBRE has a wealth of information and resources available to their employees, but the on boarding of new employees and training is somewhat non-existent, excluding the welcome online training that is pretty useless and no one remembers.  Yet, if you have a Manager that isn't wore too thin and care then you may have a totally different experience.  Communication from the top down was a bit of a mess as well.  Organizationally, the Portland office has been through multiple Directors the past few years and is a complete mess!"
good,"You pretty much have to force it upon your manager that you want to move vertically/horizontally within the company.  Otherwise, you will sit in the same position for years, in which was the case for me."
good,Corporate values do not seem to be implemented on client accounts.  Would like to see Corporate include personnel on client accounts in local company events.
good,"CBRE is committed to delivering the best level of service to all of it's clients and is constantly seeking opportunities to up level service and delivery. The company is serious about safety and strives to reinforce a culture of safety across all of its accounts through trainings, reward programs and other avenues. There is great opportunity to move within the CBRE network of accounts; whether you are looking for a promotion, a lateral move or you're looking to relocate. Where CBRE has not done so great is with it's employees. The benefit program for employees is lacking in comparison with others in the industry as well as the pay - there is no tuition assistance program or paid sick time (sick time is taken as PTO which should be only for vacation). Opportunities for other paid memberships or training courses such as FMP, PMP, etc. are awarded based on seniority meaning the lower level managers or staff members don't stand a chance. Basically, CBRE puts a lot more initiative into keeping clients and maintaining those relationships than they do in ensuring their employees have all of the necessary tools and skills to keep improving. All of the accounts that I have been on (3 total) have been severely understaffed and there is no room to grow the staff (or even create new roles as needed) because of contract terms that are not realistic. This causes overlapping of duties and overworked staff which kills moral. In order to grow you typically have to move on to another account. Overall I have learned a lot and grown tremendously in my career with CBRE and I am hopeful that they"
good,"The policies and procedures and training are of the highest quality.  The company functions more like a corporation that oversees franchises in that each office has it's own set of rules and does not necessarily comply with the umbrella corporate policies and procedures, which creates conflict and frustration.  There is a strong silo effect in place.  There is much encouragement from upper management to offices to reach out and engage with each other but it doesn't happen."
good,Completing work orders on a daily basis and other associates daily requests reporting problems OP manager and coming up with solutions to remedy problems.
good,"Typical work day can get a little boring at times. slow paced. "
good,we have no structure due to the fact that our manager is not in the same city that we are located in. My work environment is faced paced and keeps me busy but their is no team work.
good,"CBRE, Inc. allowed individuals to grown in their skills set.  Management was the hardest part of the job because they did not empower their employees."
good,"Para uma empresa multinacional, tem como política da empresa muito ruim, só visa o benefício da própria empresa, pelo menos a situada dentro da Syngenta, acredito que seja a administração deste contrato."
good,I actually came in through a temp agency to manage a property and ended up having to do a complete file audit. That wasn't bad because I like that type of work. When I was let go it was a seniority thing and they didn't have anywhere for me to go. Before that I enjoyed working with this company.
good,"The company actively seeks bright employees that bring an MBA pedigree, sophisticated analytic abilities and/or financial backgrounds to staff a number of consulting and corporate advisory groups.  For young employees (i.e. 22-28) these roles do offer significant responsibility, direct client exposure and a seemingly promising career path.  However, true growth in these roles is limited.  Also, most of these ""managers"" are former brokers or even current ones in a player/coach role.  Their priority is finding new business, not running a business in the truest sense.  Lastly, everyone gets paid from commissions and, because of all the people involved taking a cut, margins are very thin.  Unless you happen to be the group manager you will not see meaningful compensation.  If your comp aspirations are low CBRE can be a great place to work and many do for decades.  If you want to make money, avoid these groups.  CBRE doesn't say this but the heart of the company is brokers who ""control"" relationships with landlord and tenants.  Everyone else is a means to getting those people paid."
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
good,"One of the greatest companies I have ever worked for. The only downside to working her is poor management and way, way to much safety training. I believe these trainings are a waste of time and money."
good,"managed 9 warehouse facilities for Iron Mountain Account"
good,"Great pay, co workers just managed a little bit stand off. CBRE cut $ into the HSA employee plan and didn't meet the bonus promises."
good,la apariencia y la imagen es  importantísima no tanto el fondo. Personal muy muy joven con altísima rotación.
good,"Responsibilities included supervising employees and contractors and                    "
good,"expected to do my work and my direct reports work with little monetary incentive. expected to put work before family. started work 7:00am got home around 7pm, every other week I had to travel."
good,"The role in CBRE is quite varied and interesting. However, continued staff turnover is a major issue which prevents fixing legacy issues and allows people to take a step back saying 'they never caused the problem'."
good,"Typical Day At Work on the night shift 11pm-7am"
good,Not a bad place to work pay is good but benefits are below average.  Lots of long hours and OT. No real direction from Management from top down.  Typical day on average is 10 hours.  Like my summary says not for everyone. If you don't mind long days and lots of weekend work then this job might be for you.
good,"The work life balance and job culture may vary depending on the account.  As with any management company, the culture of the contracted company is sometimes lost depending on the account."
good,"Work as an embedded tech at the customer's location. There is no communication from upper management to my team. When there is communication, it is either from spam corporate emails that have absolutely nothing to do with my job OR something went wrong and a higher manager is coming in to give us a stern lecture OR it is HR trying to set something up, such as meeting/lunch/training which my team cannot attend. That last one is important, because again, it shows the local HR doesn't even recognize my team's job responsibilities or the contractual obligation to the customer."
good,"Benefits are poor. Some co-workers are catty and gossip about others. Most of our programs, such as the work order management system, barely function. You are expected to do nothing during your shift other than watch the monitors. There is very little required work, and more often than not I am staring at the clock for 13 hours. There is nothing mentally engaging, and no additional training offered. My direct supervisor is very nice and easy to talk to. The new project manager that was just hired is very professional and easy to get in touch with. Most of the facility staff are professional and courteous."
good,"A typical day begins with a Monday morning conference call followed up with a recap of the weeks deliverables. Tuesday through Thursday is site visits to my region ( All of NC & SC 650 Bank locations)"
good,The company in a whole has done very well for themselves. But its the small split off sections like the facilties departments that get left in the wind. Most customer service reps are stuck with that title and cannot get a fair chance to move up. The managment staff doesnt want you excel past where they are. So they continue to stand in your way from moving up. The co-workers are friendly and they band together when faces with challenges. I have learned a great deal from this company some good some bad. A lot of the managment staff has no formal training in there positions. Its not what you know here its who you know that determines if you move up or not. If your looking for a job just to get by while your in school I recommend CBRE but if your looking for a career I would say keep moving.
good,"Samen proberen een goed draaiend team te worden. Leuk contact met onderhoudspartijen. "
good,I have found that your experience at CBRE largely depends on what account you're on. I have had one good and bad experience over 3 years.
good,"I thoroughly enjoy the work that I do.  As a Business Training Specialist working in connection with the financial reporting teams, I have had the opportunity to develop, implement, and facilitate trainings for the various client accounting policies and procedures in connections with SSAE16.  I have also had the opportunity to develop, implement, and facilitate training for accounting web-based programs, CORE, Transform AP (TAP), ServiceInsight, and JD Edwards."
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
good,"AR, AP, Statements, Assist Tenants, Assist with Front Desk"
good,Most troubling of all is that regional management there are blind to how some of the people in the office are treated. There is such a cut throat atmosphere to make a sale that if you are not part of sales you are 2nd class.  
good,"I am currently employed at CBRE Limited Toronto West a commercial real estate brokerage. However, I am interest in exploring other career options. My confidence in my qualification comes from my two years of work experience with one of the top performing industrial teams in Ontario. My daily activities ranged from creating proposals and disposition templates, along with the constant updating of branding changes. I have created and designed several sign requests and signage drafts. Everyday activity mainly focused on the creation of marketing flyers, newspaper ads, reporting letters for client, drafting and coordinating offers. I also have experience with property inspections, scheduling and coordinating property tours. I am highly proficient in Microsoft Office as well as adobe illustrator and reader. I work well independently as well as in a team atmosphere. One of my strongest attributes would be my desire to learn any skill until perfected. I can multi task or delegate well to complete the required project."
good,Great benefits.
good,"Fun position with lots of different day to day interaction with tenants.  Enjoyed working here and gained valuable experience, however it was not a good fit with management at the time."
good,"CBRE focus is on real estate but also is contracting service that employs contractors for customers."
good,"CBRE Loan Servicing  (Houston) would be would be a great place to work  if they practiced the equality that they brag about. The environment can be a bit difficult at times. This is because the employees that have been there forever (10+ years) are looked over for promotions and any kind of advancement. They watch people come in and work 6 months to a year and move up within the company. The African American employees don’t stand a chance in this department. The managers are not there to manage, they are just warm bodies to fill a seat. With some managers being held accountable and some actual diversity this would be a great place to work."
good,On new account with no structure or scope of work dismal can transfer after 6 months but ?? Maintain 11 buildings with a lot of micromanaging horrible filthy job.
good,The company and the benefits are outstanding. After a period of time you can work from home 2 days a week.  They do call weather days in which you can work at home.  The expectations out of management are a little much. It is a very clickish type of environment. Favoritism is played hard within this company. The holidays are wonderful.
good,"CBRE offered a very good pay, excellent working hours and the freedom to excel in your work. Other than those points, the company was lacking in good communication and management. Also, you can give 110 percent in your work and recieve next to zero recognition. There is little appreciation for your efforts."
good,"I spend the day answering emails and calls from FM's and vendors, managing contracts. I work at a client site, therefore, we have to follow their dress code and workplace culture."
good,Uses you for your work knowledge and has no loyalty.  Benefits are better than most places but you do put in the hours.  Do not receive much management support.
good,"Remote technical and management support basically, non existent resulting in stressful work environment, essentially on your own to resolve technical and complex issues, Direct supervisor was in remote location and incompetent, good pay and benefits but no support and coworker was a slacker, resulting in more of a personal workload."
good,"Mi experiencia en la empresa ha sido más que positiva, contando siempre con grandes profesionales de los que aprender, tanto profesional como personalmente."
good,"This company has given me a solid base to move forward from, although I think there is currently no forward movement for me at the company which is why I am looking to move on."
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
good,"CBRE is a good company.  The immediate supervisors was where the issues are.  After changing from ISS to CBRE they had a lot of speed bumps and with it being an older facility, they stopped any work so it made upkeep impossible to maintain. The only work had to be done with three levels of approval and then the information from immediate manager was non existent and if we did get it very slow."
good,"If you don't mind working 7 days a week, 12 hrs per day this company is for you.  Provide competitive salaries and benefits but the big draw is working remotely from home on the Facilities Management side.  Most of the people are nice to work with but the pressure that comes from above makes everyone tense and tired and creates a culture of throwing others under the bus or deflecting blame to protect themselves.  There is little job security but that's common in all big organizations now."
good,"over the years CBRE has gone form amazing to concerning. Lost a lot of great talent along the way due to pay raise refusals, lack of leadership, and burned bridges.  However, the job is mostly what you make it. Requires more than 40 hours a week to even meet an expectation."
good,"I would suggest to keep reinvesting into the basics and encourage your people to grow and expand. Make sure everyone is on the same page. Poor people, culture, and environment"
good,Todo muy correcto y gran aprendizaje rodeada de grandes profesionales
good,"8.30AM to 6PM workday, stressful, no work life balance, fast-paced, bonus a major chunk of pay, health insurance/benefit is below market standard, convenient location right by Grand Central train station"
good,I think the owner was a superb person. I think he was a stand up genuine person. I enjoyed working at this company very much. I think that this company has a lot ahead for them in growth and what they have to offer for the city of Omaha.
good,"cbre is a great place to work if your not interested in advancement. There are so many moving parts to your daily function. your sometimes caught in the middle. I actually enjoyed working here. it was challenging, rewarding to get to a job thru completion. they just decided that the roving techs were not needed anymore and started contracting everything out."
good,"Too many ""dynamic"" processes without any real training programs. Processes are encumbering & constantly changing with no communication to ALL of the associates that they effect. Individual departments/groups seem to work in their associated vacuums."
good,"Empresa insertada en una industra muy dinámica y en constante movimiento, como lo es la Industria Inmobiliaria, genera buenos ingresos y sus instalaciones son de primer nivel, como buena empresa multinacional"
good,"A very stable job with set hours, for those who like routine. You must be able to work through stress whilst staying emotionally stable. Promotion works through popularity as opposed to loyalty/ work rate."
good,"Enjoyed working for this company. Competitive, fast paced environment, good culture. Growing company with lots of business in leasing, land sales, etc."
good,"Since the management change in May 2016 I feel much more supported.  The management has realised my strengths and are extremely supported."
good,"Professional organization with many different job opportunities and choices."
good,I believe that my account has a unique experience due to the poor planning executed before the account went live. The experience could have been much smoother and a less hostile environment from the client had the account been properly setup before the Go Live date.
good,"Company is op heavy in management, have many layers of insulation to protect upper management in case of problems."
good,"Management was poor and did not respond when input was needed on job conditions and pressure was always put on the over perform any work required, patience was not a virtue, producing was."
good,CBRE won bid to service client.  Overall work environment was comfortable and enjoyable due to interaction with client.  Over site of facility was provided by client.
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
good,"Travail de management et collaborateurs agréables. En ce qui concerne le proces c'est un vrai parcours de croix."
good,"Foi uma excelente experiencia acrescida em meu curriculo, aprendi os serviços referentes a administração de condomínio empresarial, conviver com publico em geral, localizar e resolver problemas no condominio, a parte desagradavel era o percurso onde levava 2 horas pra chegar ao trabalho."
good,"There's a great camaraderie among coworkers - the feeling of being ""in the trenches"" together. That said, management does not seem capable of understanding the workload or how to allot staff appropriately. For this reason, the relationship between CBRE and their client (Google) is strained. "
good,"not enough staff for what work there is and put to much pressure on the staff which do the work."
good,"Managed a high-volume workload within a deadline-driven environment. Resolved an average of 550 inquiries in any given week and consistently met performance benchmarks in all areas (speed, accuracy, volume)."
good,"Estou há oito anos na Johnson Controls que foi comprada pela CBRE GWS e julgo ser uma ótima empresa para trabalhar. O que as vezes dificulta, são alguns líderes e clientes impertinentes."
good,"Loved working for the company, however, was not a challenging position. Did a lot of event planning, however, my interest was in marketing and property operations."
good,"During my time with CBRE, there was no shortage of high paced, attention to detail tasks that would be presented to you during the span of the day.  Relationship maintenance was key as was an extremely high level of customer service to onsite clientele."
good,"Good Company but Management is not up to the mark and no technical gaining from senior staff. less process driven , they are not following strictly their own policies."
good,"The CBRE real estate accounting department is in a transitional period, attempting to reposition itself within the larger company from a cost source to a profit center. The department initiatives implemented along these lines have created a fair amount of tension amongst the employees, who have not seen compensation rise along with larger workloads and longer hours. The employees are largely congenial and cooperative. Management is struggling, though, to keep new clients satisfied as they try to expand their client base outside of the typical large, institutional investment firms. Turnover is becoming problematic, and may remain so unless management can find resources to incentivize employees to stay."
good,"Set myself up for the day by doing the filing, Excel spreadsheets, whether it be editing information or starting a new one. I only dealt with the office manager and the executive manager. I didn't deal with anyone else."
good,Not bad company. Will not stop in expecting more  tasks with out training.
good,"would have to drive to the center of gwinnett and pick up the van because i live in south hall and they said that was to far to drive the van home and my time did not start until i got to the first job once i arrived i would perform building maintenance on the property  HVAC lighting,plumbing, and sometimes  just performed building checks.then went from site to site throughout the day the most enjoyable part of the job working on my own.The hardest part of the job i was micro managed from the manager using the gps system as her personal time clock not accounting for Atlanta traffic"
good,"- Every day exposes you to something new"
good,"Their is Pro and Cons to work for CBRE, but over all it all depend on how the person is looking at"
good,Starting at this job as a day porter i had always wanted to move into the engineer helpers position to become a licensed engineer. After roughly 3 years with this company the position i had been waiting and hoping for finally opened up and i let it be known how interested i was to fill the spot. Unfortunately i was passed over and they hired an outside person. i felt slited and mistreated and it really put a bad taste in my mouth about the management of this company. most of my co-workers are great but some people seem as though they only care about themselves and their own advancement and step on others to get there.
good,There is no such thing as a typical day at work. A large portion of my day is spent putting together listing files for the brokers. I also perform back up receptionist duties. Brokers aren't always given a lot of lead way to conduct tours so sometimes I have to put together tour packages in a few hours. I work with a lot of professional people that appreciate my skills and what I have to offer to the company.
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
good,Handle lease negotiations for client account. Work in team environment to meet all client needs. Collaborate on solutions for client with team to perform job to highest level.
good,"CBRE is a terrific company. They have a great reputation in the industry and because they are very well established, they have great procedures in place."
good,The IT department is new so the company lacks any solid processes. Unfortunately they've hired non IT people to manage teams which does not work out because they lack the technical knowledge to build an IT foundation.
good,Business casual work environment with no frills. It was all work all the time and everyone in the office was always busy. The office I worked in was a high production office that serviced a number of clients and properties.
good,I applied for a management position and when I was not picked I was told one of the main reasons was I didn’t have a facilities manger certification.  So within a month after I got the certificate.  My new manger not knowing I had it wanted me to acquire it for my annual review  when I showed him that I had already received it he stated that he should go ahead and get his as well.  so basically I was lied to.  That manger no longer works there.
good,"top heavy with management. 13 years with them have been on several accounts and its always the same with management teams not treating the employees under them  with the respect they deserve. pay is ok, promotions do not come easy, raises are always the same , no more than 3% each year."
good,zu kurze erforderliche Einweisung am neuen Arbeitsplatz bzw. nicht ausreichend für die Erfordernisse
good,"Good: CBRE has many accounts, and is basically everywhere. Offers a fair bit of mobility and other options, especially if you have the right background for it. Good teams and accounts are great. Wide variety of job options if you're just starting out."
good,"Work life balance is great. However, there is no growth opportunity. Internal promotion is non existent for people of color. Diverse employees are over looked and not included. Diversity is a work in progress, but yet so far behind."
good,Shepharding items through various business units who have no long term plans. Majority of time is spent on administrative work becuase the company is not fluid.
good,There was not a lot of support from upper management which created a very stressful work environment.  There was a team environment regarding other management teams.
good,"Bad management and scheduling, it pays great though. I did not like the fact that the work was very unorganized and the opportunity to advance comes very slowly."
good,"While working at CBRE, there was a lot of turnaround. "
good,"Service engineers usually have SOP's, work guidelines, etc but those have not been provided for our site. During the hiring process it was stated they had all this plus training from the vendors to service their equipment. I haven't seen anything of this nature."
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
good,"Not a lot of room for advancement, or so it seems. "
good,"Whatever Amazon wants, It goes. Even if it means breaking CBRE rules. All they care about is keeping there contract with Amazon. I think there a great company outside of Amazon."
good,"CBRE is not a bad company it all depends on the client.  CBRE is one of the better outsource companies I've worked for. Wish they paid more, others do"
good,"The company pays well and has good benefits.  Does not support continuing professional learning.  To many initiatives, doesn't follow through with everything started."
good,"Tras fichar por una gran multinacional,número uno en su sector, encantado con tus nuevas funciones, descubres que tu trabajo se convierte en una serie de días monótonos delante de un ordenador, realizando un trabajo administrativo que nada tiene que ver con lo que he realizado en mi día a día con mi carrera profesional. Un entorno de trabajo desactualizado y desgastado que merma la ilusión de llegar con ganas a trabajar. He aprendido muchas cosas nuevas, todo he de decirlo, pero ¿como no iba a ser a si cuando nunca he desempeñado un puesto de trabajo similar? La presión que se ejerce en este puesto no esta recompensada económicamente para el nivel de exigencia, horas extras y dolores de cabeza."
good,Good work/life balance. Work load is manageable and weekend work is limited. The ability to work remotely very limited in particular departments. Management style does not allow for self-direction and doesn't trust staff enough to allow for this which makes them micromanage. Work start day is flexible within a window and the management is flexible with leaving early/coming in late if necessary. People are generally nice and fun.
good,"Positive place to work; however long hours and no life/work balance."
good,"I would describe it as large workload and small salary. There are very nice benefits, but very bad bonus system. Company doesn't care about employees, first business, later people. Company prefers to take each month new people than give promotion to their employees."
good,I worked very hard to increase my revenue on my account and I did by increasing srervices with out any recognician from my manager.  I had to increase my revenue each year with a client that was constantly down sizing the budget which was very challenging.  I had the highest safety record of any account in the company and a great profit margin. I had a great team to work with at this account.
good,"like any other brokerage firm, it is what you make of it. their newport beach office is great and there are definitely plenty of resources to assist you in your endeavors."
good,"Bending over for brokers. Tons of bureaucracy. Work gets tedious and not a lot of room for advancement. Average corporate life, as much as they try to make it exciting with happy hour, it's dry."
good,I worked for CBRE 12 years and used to be great company but last two years everything slowly started going down the hill when is about management.Micromanaging is the main reason why I left the company.
good,This company's environment is not for everyone. The quality of work life is related to your supervisor.  Property team was great. Overall company is well respected and is viewed as an excellent company.
good,"My first job here with CBRE when I graduated from college. I was with this company for about 8 years going through 3 different positions and relocation. Like most companies, they're looking at the bottom line first and not too much care is allotted for the employees well beings or job securities. Lay off was inevitable."
good,Good place to build Accounting experience.  Fast paced work environment and provides lots of tools to support employee complete daily work.   CBRE offers many training programs to support employees growth.
good,Spoke with vendors to get them on-boarded to provide services to our clients. Ensured Compliance and assisted with any questions they might have regarding work orders and invoicing.
good,"CBRE is good company."
good,"CBRE as a larger global property development company are experts"
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
good,"Very large global property and development company that takes great pride with the purchase and maintenance of land and buildings."
good,"Though the work was fairly easy and mundane at times, I enjoyed the flexibility of being able to listen to music while getting my work done, and the fact that you were never expected to stay late, or overwork yourself past the 8-hour day.  What I didn't like was the fact that no matter what the circumstances were, you were in no way allowed to defend yourself when it came to being disrespected by the students and/or faculty within the facility.  We were always told ""they are a million-dollar client that we cannot afford to lose"" so basically we were made to take the disrespectful behavior and could not stand up for ourselves if they ever crossed a line.  In short, their ""bottom line"" mattered more to them than the sanity and safety of their own employees and it was becoming highly stressful to the point, I would feel sick to my stomach before going into work every day.  No job should ever make you feel that way."
good,As pessoas na CBRE não são éticas.A empresa não valoriza seus talentos.
good,Gives people insights into working for a large corporation; a lot of young professionals start careers here and then move on. You have to work your way up and earn your keep.
good,"If a good desk job is what you're after, go for it.  If you want an exhilarating job, look elsewhere.  It's hard to feel like you're making a real difference in the world in commercial real estate but like I said, if you want a good living, go for it."
good,"Everyone works remotely therefore a lot of assumptions are made and acted upon in contrast to what's really going on or intended. Because of this, no relationships are formed within departments or divisions and everyone acts as if they are individuals competing with each other."
good,"When new management appear, the existing  team gets ignored. In a few words they bring they own group. Work culture is fine is you are part of the group."
good,CBRE is a place to work if you are right out of school looking for a growing company. The company can get too big and require long hours to complete the workload they give.
good,"I enjoyed my experience there. Managed and analyzed monthly variance lease abstracts by editing narratives to support computer generated reports for customer interpretation. Established and monitored budgets, tracked and reconciled costs, tracked program funding requirements, conducted cost analysis, and developed variance explanations and recommendations for corrective actions as required. Assisted manager in resolving critical issues in terms of payment transactions and lease terms. Tracked payables, receivables and prepared payment request associated with lease portfolios. Reviewed incoming invoices for accuracy and correct coding."
good,"A very good company to work for. They are investors in people and push staff development."
good,A place to work.  Let's me set my own hours.  New to this business.  A real estate company.  Nothing more to say except they don't keep up with the cost of living.
good,"It has come to my attention that these Agency's require a fee to continue employing members that reach the end of the 3 month time frame, the fees required are to take the employee off the agencies books and make them permanent, some of these fees can be pretty high and these managers are left with a tough decision on their hands towards the end of the 3 months, whether to keep you on or let you go."
good,"This is a growing company with great benefits.  Management seems fair but is in need of a more streamlined leadership with a more ""boots on the ground"" mentality because it is impossible to manage efficiently from an office in an ivory tower."
good,"The management seem to suffer from narcissism, with a mindset: ""I’m right always, and I don't care if you think your right,"""
good,"The people are nice and plenty of perks. But a ""boys club"" mentality. No room for advancement if you are not in the ""club"". But a fun atmosphere if you don't care about a career."
good,"Over 3.5 years was engaged in deployment of a new account contract with several turnovers/changes in leadership during the period.  In general the collaboration was truly unique, the body of work rewarding, the challenges rewarding and the work product impactful.  At times the turnover in leadership was disruptive rather than empowering with a very ""political"" tone and dysfunctional management team.  "
good,CBRE is a OK company. Culture is fluid depending on your account. Lots of potential to move around and up. Don't stay in one place too long though. Ttyl
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
good,"Enterprise level organization growing at an alarming pace. Maturing quickly, but still has room to improve.  Challenging environment as the goals are continually shifting and the goal line is moving."
good,I love the challenge each day but the worst and almost impossible obstacle is the CMMS system Intrepid. The advances technolgy they are trying to implement is great but must first be proven before launched as the Software to serve our customers.
good,Many wonderful co-workers and managers.  Great facility with cafeteria and on-site gym. Convenient location. Safe place to work in a very populated area of Northern NJ>
good,The com[any has great benefits and work life balance.  But after I worked there 4 years and went back to college to obtain my degree I was one of the first to get laid off when oil prices dropped.
good,"The company's core values, RISE (Respect, Integrity, Service, and Excellence) are values that everyone should adhere to on a daily basis, not just in the workplace."
good,"I liked the specific location that I worked in, but the company as a whole was rigid and did not seem to care about its employees.  There was not much chance for advancement unless you were a real estate sales person."
good,"A very nice experience which i had with this company, i learnt a lot of things in my professional life.Hardest part of my job is working in night HRS and most enjoyable part of my job is when i am working on energy conservation."
good,"Very difficult having to travel to another state to work with your staff and leadership."
good,"I have been at this company for the past eleven years. I believe that the company needs a culture shock. There is still a glass window slowly, but surely turning into a concrete window at this location. Vendors such as myself are being shut out for advancing in the Microsoft culture and jobs. Women in general are not being accepted as to male peers for completing similar type of work, which in turns affects their income potential. I would like to see this change starting from the top."
good,This is respected and global company that is catching up in terms of setting up the necessary management systems and talent retention policies that match its reputation.
good,"Rewarding, but very challenging and demanding and too long of a commute."
good,"825 am "
good,Poor on boarding training. Considerable reporting to document success and value to client.  Client scope drives activities which can conflict or miss activities that should be managed.  Contract drives focus.
good,"Sometimes worked overtime and was not paid for it"
good,"I learned a lot about finance in this role, but CBRE has a very poor work/life balance as well as compensation/benefits. I work close to 100 hours a week and my salary is bellow average."
good,"The harder you work and the more dedication you show, the more they expect from you as a person. Cbre does not appreciate employees monetarily. You are stressed and worked beyond capacity and kept at the same wage for years. It's a decent job for a starter career, but not long term."
good,"Project Manager generally does not have peace of mind, but working in CBRE gives you a comfort level as co-workers & higher management is always there to help you out."
good,"good so far, this January will only be one year. since this company profits from my labor, they watch you like a hawk, sometimes as if you are an unconvicted criminal. People have taken advantage od the system, so they seem to treat you all like we are one of a kind."
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
good,"Promotes diversity, however, need to improve on the number of minority women in leadership positions.  In addition, CBRE need to invest more into the value of their employees."
good,"Property management is never easy, but this has been good role to gain experience. Each office location is different; the one I work at is pretty much busy all day, management is great and understands that we have lives other than work."
good,Very busy from the get go. When your client gets sold you are just assigned to a new team without any say. So managers are great and some managers are not good. Your success depends upon your managers ability to teach and train.
good,it’s a contract position it may or may not manifest just have to wait-and-see. Still in training at this time so I don’t have any good inches or feedback at this time
good,"mooi bedrijf met interessante propositie, jonge mensen. Veiligheid staat hoog in het vaandel"
good,Company is good had fun learning new things and there is probably only 1 thing I can say bad is I had 1 manager single me out till I got let go . It's funny how I should have listened to other employees on the way he is .... would like to go back to work for the company but a different area ....
good,"great for all areas, thank you  high volume recruiting for different industries, management in a corporate environment, high volume recruiting, different"
good,"Low wages, high turnover, high burnout rate, repetitive work, just a spoke in the wheel. The benefits are okay but eroding over time. HSA contribution has gone from $500 to $200 in a matter of years, for example."
good,"The job was enjoyable, typical office position working Monday - Friday, 830am-5pm. My manager was very nice, liked the work and taking care of the office."
good,I initially was employed thru Medstar Franklin Square Hospital. A few years into my employment CBRE took over as a management company. I was much happier with Medstar Franklin Square. In the very near future CBRE will be ending their management responsibilities for which the employees are unsure of who will be taking over. I am very concerned of the uncertainty of my future with them.
good,"CBRE is pretty great to work at. Nobody standing over you, no crazy politics to speak of. Overall not bad. Everyone seems to treat everyone with respect"
good,"Lease Admin at CBRE is a challenging, fast-paced environment with opportunities, however, if poor leadership is in place (as is the case at the moment), the lack of support makes the stress level unworkable."
good,"Fun place to work with good benefits. But if you do not work in an actual CBRE corporate office you are not included in some of the corporate activities/ Upper management is slow at making decisions. They did not train me very well for my position, instead had me watch hours of out dated training videos."
good,This was the typical maintenance job. Waaaay overloaded with square feet on this particular contract.  My previous contract was not too bad. No real opportunity for advancement.
good,CBRE has given me an opportunity to learn many various topics to round out my skill set. CBRE with the right Client has many promotion opportunities to advance/
good,Its a great entry point into the commercial real estate with room for growth.   Opportunity to contribute to a team and share collaborative ideas. Work culture is professional.
good,Every day is a different day in property management.  I enjoy working with professional individuals and management at CBRE.  Good pay and benefits. Nice clients too.
good,"I spent time doing a lot of administrative tasks even though I was hired to be an analyst.  I enjoyed the training opportunities available to me, and I genuinely liked the people on my team."
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
good,"It's great looking from the outside, very profitable and posh. But, in the end its the land of the haves and have not's. The admins make below market salaries while the brokers make millions."
good,"A typical day at work consist"
good,"This job was hard at times,. But everyone work together to get the job done. The people there are friendly and the manager always will to help. I can't tell you all the things I learn working there"
good,Overall good company culture but definitely an old boys' club that is reluctant to change and rewards/values the brokers over just about everyone else in the organization to the point that it can be offensive. Poor compensation package that does not coincide with the cost of living and bonuses are few and far between along with raises.
good,"Good morning to all of my co-workers when I enter my building.  Most of them make an effort to do the same.  Tour the entire building and out and observe any safety concerns and items of immediate attention.   Go visit my supervisor for discussions.  Create a day schedule for the janitors, maintenance team, and security staff.  "
good,"Fast paced, sometimes long hours, but the ability to work independently which I appreciated. Fellow coworkers were pleasant and made for an enjoyable work experience."
good,"I'm a very hard worker, so I didn't mind working hard every day. Sometimes it got to be a little much with the written reports, and all the physical expectations, but I always accomplished my goals."
good,"Challenging and never a dull moment. Management left a lot to be desired. Good tools and resources to do job, but training was always an up-hill battle,"
good,"It depends on the department, manager, director, etc.  For the majority of my time there, I felt supported and thrived.  Then that turned on a dime and the culture became somewhat toxic.  But with the right personality mesh and management, one can do quite well."
good,"very demanding, need on top of client request all the time. no job security if company lost contract. "
good,I enjoyed the position I held at CBRE and the flexibility with my work hours. I enjoyed my daily duties and being able to stay busy at all times . I also enjoyed working with the brokers.
good,"Generally a good place to work, however some management issues exist. There is flexibility in hours and you have the ability to work from  anywhere.  Many incentives are available."
good,"Was a fun place to work,had to pull teeth to get help. Expected you to shut home life off while at work. Could not leave if emergency happen at home. Had to give weeks notice if needed off for doctor or 2 weeks for vacation."
good,"There is a lot of client Accounting involved and wearing a lot of hats. Biggest problem with CBRE , is that there are too many office politics, they watch how you dress so closely."
good,"CBRE is overall a good company to work for with good benefits and leadership. That said, depending on the contract you're working on, the opportunity for growth will vary."
good,Enjoyed my office and work mates. The location is perfect and an easy commute. Super busy office always lots to do. The whole office is easy to get along with.
good,"General clerical and secretarial operation, typing works (both Chinese and English) formatting of simple and professional reports, prepare property photos, floor plan, location plan…"
good,"Great insurance benefits, training was available, safety for employees is important, there was an intranet site that let you know about the company's policy's and proceedures."
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
good,"The company in many aspects is simply your ""average"" workplace with nothing I find particular worthy noting or praising.   Having worked for similar size companies (100,000 employees worldwide) over my 30+ year career you are only a number unless your status is executive management.."
good,"CBRE is a good company to work for, lower level management leaders could use some guidance due to size of organization, this is not easily seen by the upper levels of management"
good,"A typical day consisted of helping my coworkers with unfinished work orders, helping managers when necessary. The hardest part of my job was not getting sup[port from your bosses when needed."
good,CBRE is a good starter job for someone straight out of college who wants experience. The remote days help when you need to be more flexible with hours.
good,"Wake up, logon and fix the first fire that needs to be put out, then see if there is anything that needs to be moved to a new environment. Basically general IT work."
good,"Bonne solidarité entre collègues"
good,"I enjoyed working for CBRE but became frustrated as every avenue for advancement was cut off. Certain promises were made when I was hired regarding advancement opportunities which never materialized then all opportunities became tied to relocation which had not been the case when I was hired. Then job descriptions changed and there was less responsibility, less involvement. This was not just for me but others at my level as well. Turnover in our department has now reached over 150% over 5-1/2 years through both voluntary and involuntary means."
good,"As a real estate accountant, I started from the bottom up; intern, temp, associate accountant, accountant. It was fairly easy to move up or sideways as long as you voiced your ability and worked toward it. However, the management staff are too overwhelmed to assist their teams and so they overwork their employees. This causes around the clock work and stress and leads to consistently late or barely on-time products and causes the employees to not only train themselves and their cohorts, but also the real estate managers onsite which takes time away from tasks within their own job description. Additionally, starting salary is lower than the overall salary within the industry and is hard to gain raises."
good,I took calls for maintenance request from different companies such as bank of America Wells Fargo and other companies. took about  calls daily. would not recommend to anyone.
good,As I am considered contract employee it would be difficult to rate my experience relating to benefits and other compensation.  It is a large corporation with many layers.
good,"CBRE is a great place to begin a career in real estate.  They have excellent training programs for young people just out of college.The offices across the country are vastly different, in culture and specialties."
good,I enjoyed working for this company; the only problem was they had the good ol boy system. If they didn't approve of your beliefs  they terminated you.
good,Only there a short time and was overall satisfied; benefits were okay but really enjoyed unlimited PTO and their bonuses. I had the opportunity to be help them achieve their goals each month.
good,"There was so much corporate protocol and procedural redundancy that it made it hard to actually DO the job. People were nice, HR was helpful, and the company is successful, but it felt like more time was spent on company mandates than the performance of the actual job."
good,"No growth opportunity unless you want to be in sales.  Any support positions have salary caps and the only way in which you can gradually earn a higher salary is if your team gives you a raise paid OUT OF THEIR POCKETS.  Read: the company will never, ever pay you more - you have to beg your direct manager to pay you more out of their own pockets - makes for an extremely awkward chat.  This company is NOT with the times and treats support staff like they're worth nothing, simply because they're an expense on the company ledger (salespeople are 100% commission so they don't cost the company anything)."
good,"Very corporate office. Do not compensate their employees well, in comparison to the market. Very poor management. You need to be with a great team if you really want to excel in your career. Everything is political with CBRE, but there are some perks to working with such a large corporation."
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
good,CBRE was a great learning experience for me. I matured as an individual by taking up more and more responsibilities during my time at the company. My manager was a great mentor who noticed my work and always guided me in delivering top-notch quality of work to our clients.
good,Super fun and great place to work. Eat what you kill mentality can be gruesome at times but the rewards are so much better. Make so much money and be awesome yay!!
good,"professional company, unlike many others in the real estate industry. However, its different departments vary significantly in standard and quality of employees/processes followed."
good,"This was a fill in job in my career in order to have a steady income but with no hope of advancement. First opportunity I got to leave I took it, even though I had to relocate 1200 miles away."
good,Es buena empresa solo que falta mucha organizacion en sus proyectos
good,This job position with our client is based on renewable contract.  This working environment is all male and fun working with them.  My reporting boss is very understanding.
good,Working at CBRE Investors was okay.  There were some nice perks.  I worked well with my managers and co-workers.  The company created real estate trusts which I found to be very interesting.
good,"Not much flexibility with hours."
good,"Open space environment creates a tense environment, sitting in the same space with mgt."
good,"CBRE puts a lot of effort into touting its values and standards, and emphasizes how much the people who work there are a vital part of their success.  However, the company is just too big to be flexible in its procedures.  In order to create a consistent level of quality, there are a lot of policies, procedures and platforms that add a lot of extra work.  The company tries to instill its culture with slogans rather than by really connecting with the people who work for them.  I really enjoy the people I work with but don't really have time to get to know them on more than a superficial level.  CBRE is great at promoting from within and the managers are committed to helping staff grow in their careers.  However, the mandatory training is superficial and designed to get everyone to the lowest acceptable level.  This is a good company for the right person.  If it isn't a perfect fit, the organization isn't going to adapt to meet your needs."
good,"I hired in at one facility on a set schedule, salaried Chief Engineer.  Moved to facility not requiring an Engineer, different schedule, supposedly up"
good,"CBRE work environment was good.There was a friendly environment among the team members. With respect to contract term CBRE is not flexible to extend the contract,"
good,"Company is managing properties throughout the east coast, but the property I work at is unique.  It is a full campus of buildings, most of which are provided heat and cooling from a single central plant.  All their other properties are stand alone buildings, and they are inexperienced in this setting.  I believe that once they gain more experience they will  be very successful here."
good,"The best accounting department to work with in Omaha, NE."
good,I enjoyed working with my coworkers. It was a laid back environment but from time to time I didn’t feel my manager was supportive of me and sincere. The work itself was fast pace and challenging at times but  easy
good,Good company to work for. Required to work more than a 40 hour work week during budgets. CBRE is big company and so it is hard to get noticed if you want to advancement.
good,"They don't pay well. Salaries low, large workload, success is on the backs of their employees with no regard to how hard you work. Would not recommend working for them."
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
good,"Very busy workplace"
good,Good learning experience with good benefits. Good amount of work and resources to help you learn. Learned accounting and management to help day to day objectives
good,Highly regarded real estate investment management firm with an exceptional reputation in the market. Colleagues are highly qualified and personable. The environment is quite serious.
good,The duties as a Program Manager were straight forward and easy to follow.  Job is similar to being a project manager for other companies.  I used my technical expertise of data centers while managing projects for the critical environment.  Focusing on the facility project.
good,"Account Based Jobs with limited advancement opportunities.  Every client has individual team to manage and there are limited budget to hire people therefore, small set of professionals are working to get things done.  Overall not a bad company to work with however, after sometime you have to look for other challenges if you would like to grow your career."
good,It was alright. Worked everyday with a group of fellow engineers who performed maintenance at several buildings. Did what to be done to keep customers happy and safe.
good,"Fast paced customer service, detailed orientated, good benefits, the Santa Rosa site that I worked at is a beautiful campus and the customer is very engaged with CBRE"
good,"interesting work, contract facilities services unit at a major pharma firm,varied tasks oprtuniity to learn, advancement may require relocation pay moderate, coworkers good, supivisoryadequate"
good,empresa razuavel de se trabalhar embora em alguns aspectos se mostrar ainda imatura apesar de seu tamanho
good,Ho avuto modo di sviluppare ulteriormente le mie capacità di gestire e svolgere in autonomia il mio lavoro Ho condiviso l'esperienza entusiasmante della fase di start up del reparto in cui mi trovavo insieme ai colleghi con cui si era creato un forte spirito collaborativo.
good,Large global commercial real estate firm currently privately held. The company is aggressively recruiting in all service lines in order to compete globally wit the largest firms in the industry.
good,"Seems to be a good company to work for, but your job is in the hands of the client. If there are cuts to the contract then your job position can also be cut...as mine has. I guess it depends on the account you land on."
good,"Implement new things and generate them and update with clients,"
good,Databasing and market research mostly. Really enjoyed the people I worked with fortunately. Would love the opportunity to join them full-time. Overall great experience.
good,"In a typical day of work you never know what you are going to be working on, either you can spend your whole shift behind a computer or 30 minutes turning a screwdriver.  When there's actual work we all think safety first. Manager are good and well trained some other are just ok. Co workers are great cant complain. cant say there is one other than sitting around for long periods."
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
good,"Great place to work, management felt a bit out of touch at crucial times. Great people to work with room to grow. There are many tools that are available for success"
good,"A day at work can vary greatly from what you plan to what you actually do. Every store and manager is different. You have on-line training. It can be hard to get answers at times because of the isolation from an office. The hardest part is changing what you are doing immediately to do something completely different. It takes a lot of organization. It is nice to walk a store and see how it looks when the jobs you assign are completed, especially after comparing it to your competitors. The other hard challenge is trying to meet your budget, but the target constantly moves. You have deadlines to meet, but vendors can be a problem they way the try to delay a date. Since all actions have to be documented, it starts to take more time doing the paperwork end as opposed to the actual field work."
good,"CBRE is a great company, but it was unfortunate enough for me to be on a terrible account. The overall managing was awful and the morale on the account was very low. I've heard CBRE is a great company, but did not get to experience it with the account that I was on."
good,"With CBRE's rapid world-wide growth has required it to be a shop that treats everyone the same, instead of individuals being able to excel and grow at their own pace."
good,"Work with Leasing Agents to facilitate bldg. occupation"
good,"Busy, dynamic environment. Lots to accomplish but can be very rewarding for the right person. Quality co-workers. My team is an outstanding group of guys that always do what it takes to succeed."
good,"I believe this is an excellent company to work for depending on the person. For each person the atmosphere and enviornment of the company has a lot to do with an employees longevity with the company and desire to remain with the company. The atmosphere was not the best suitable for me, however I do believe that for the right person(s) it could provide an excellent opportunity for them."
good,"Work onsite a pharma company.  CBRE acquired a portion on JCI that I worked for.  They are a real estate company and don't seem well suited to understand and support bio science workers who aren't supporting a building.  Changing hands of company has been rough.  Benefits are OK; JCI was better.  Pay is good, lower managent good but upper management is out of the loop and clueless at times."
good,Working at the front desk when necessary and greet in-coming guest to become more active. I learned how to do and submit expense reports for the employees.
good,"Awesome place to work, but takes forever for you be hired or promoted or to move up permanently. Some people are still working through temp service and it has been over 2 years and has not been hired. Want a permanent career. Not a temp job."
good,It's great to work for number #1 in commercial real estate. Compensation and benefits are set up for brokers. Your view of the company really depends on what department you work in.  There is only job growth if you really fight for it (and know the right people).
good,"This company is the basic ""good ole boys"" club and you better be one if you want to make any money or get anywhere in their organization."
good,Company is a good company. really depends on what account you are on. this will decide your pay scale and medical dental benefits. it will also decide limitations of what your allowed to do for maintenance and what is contracted. the pay can be great if your on an account that is good but if your in account where the client doesn't want to spend money to have things operate to the fullest then your pay will be drastically under median.
good,Everyone is really polite and helpful.  I really enjoyed working at the Galleria location. I learned something new everyday.
good,Loved the company and the job. The insurance/benefits company they use leave a lot to be desired. The flexibility and work/life balance was fantastic.
good,"No comment, short contract period, assignment only lasted 3 months, did not have the appropriate amount working time to formulate an opinion."
good,"Good company for fresh professional to learn on the job, comparably the compensation and benefits are not up to standard. Some of the supervisor always assume you know the work and not taking time to teach you on the job."
good,CBRE is a company built on expansion and profit generation.  Those are the primary drivers of the company and also what they value most.  Do not expect a reasonable work-life balance.
good,"Fast paced during the busy hours, with time to review and train during the slow hours. Supervisors are patient while you are training."
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
good,Great professional workplace with decent management. The job is very political and only few are given the opportunity to move up in the company. The company makes many changes as well. There wasn't enough challenges in my particular position.
good,I learned  a lot from my co workers. The office personnel were very supportive.But no system in designating personnel in certain area.There's a lot of room to grow but financially constrained when comes to maintenance supplies.
good,"Good Company Vary supportive Management,Lots of things to learn,No politics funny environment good co-workers. The most enjoyable part is that the Celebration party after successful of project"
good,CBRE is a growing company that offers a lot of opportunity to its associates. The company is very committed to becoming a world class organization
good,"I have enjoyed the experience of working with an  international company.  The people on my team are amazing and have been such a wonderful support.  "
good,"Fast paced environment, co-workers were helpful and supportive. I learned the industry very well. The hardest part of the job was, the culture and mind set of the Brokers and Management. They only support Brokers not the staff."
good,"During my time with CBRE, there was no shortage of high paced, attention to detail tasks that would be presented to you during the span of the day. Relationship maintenance was key as was an extremely high level of customer service to onsite clientele."
good,Great company with very minimal micro management. Mon thru Friday with no OT (not a good thing) but overall great environment and relationship with co workers and management.
good,"Une journée typique consistait à réaliser des plans d'implantations intérieur dans différents locaux."
good,Typical day at work is busy. Co-workers provide a good support system during transitional period at the location/account.
good,I was very recently transitioned to CBRE from IRET Properties due to IRET's plan to sell their commercial and retail portfolios.  Working for CBRE was more out of necessity than choice.
good,"Good company, however very demanding and management does not understand. I managed to stay strong by not thinking of it because everything else is good."
good,"learned to use several equipment and learned cenrtral plant operations. became 608 certified, got two other hvac certificates and learned to troubleshoot equipment."
good,Je n'ai été que simple stagiaire (dans le cadre de mon BTS Assistante de Manager) dans cette entreprise du coup je ne pourrais avoir un avis appronfondi de l'entreprise mais le peu que j'ai retenue est qu'il reigne au sein de cette entreprise une bonne ambiance de travail.
good,CBRE is a fine company and a great name to have on the resume. They are a public company and all facets of the company are geared toward risk management and keeping shareholders happy. Understandable but I am looking for a different environment.
good,Worked with a dedicated team of recruiters willing to put in tireless hours under very stressful circumstances
good,"Good hours, learned alout about hvac, soom good management, great co-workers, on call,"
good,It's a good company but hard to move up in. The people are nice and enjoyable to work with.
good,"great benefits; overloads employees with unreasonable work load; supervisor was in office part time and did not supply adequate information to accomplish goals in a timely manner & was dismissive. Most enjoyable was the interaction between myself and the tenants, vendors and building staff"
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
good,"As with most big companies, it is easy to feel like just a number; however, this may have just been the culture of my particular office.  "
good,A day at work consisted of a lot of client interaction which I enjoy.
good,"Overall, CBRE is a great place for those who wanted to advance in real estate field.."
good,"My typical day includes taking power readings on all equipment, walk all mechanical rooms and raised floor data center space. Plan and preparing MOP's and SOP's for any work scheduled."
good,Training was very good and me feel this was a great place to benefit
good,Great company for entry level.  Good benefits.  Nice people.
good,"This was also my first time working as a project coordinator and the experience was rewarding.  Working directly with the engineers and keeping them on target with projects and up to date with all compliance issues was challenging but a task that I was ready for.  The co-workers were very helpful, pleasant and fun to work with.  The department was disbanned and as a result, I was laid off."
good,"I am and Electrician for CBRE and have been for almost 2 years. "
good,CBRE is a good employer however position is an outsourced support person and actually work for client and follow all their rules and regs. Job is very demanding and constantly changing.  Days fly by.
good,"Typical day was very productive and fast paced. Management is not all qualified and lacks flexibility. "
good,"2009-2012 I am working PA to Executive Director of Japanese Business. It has been challenging job for me in first year."
good,"Fast pace work environment"
good,"A typical day is spent answering phones, filing, invoicing tenants, working closely with the tenants on Janitorial requests as well as maintenance requests.  I have learned so many things in the last 5 years that it is hard to narrow it down.  I work very closely with my maintenance engineers on a daily basis dispatching, following up & closing work orders."
good,"Very busy environment, typically more work to do than days in a week. Challenging assignments."
good,Manager micromanaged the team excessively  The work was easy and  A lot of downtime
good,fun place to work. Being my first job out of college I am learning and the management work very well with your schedule
good,"Devido as varias funcões adquiri amplo conhecimento na area de Facilities e Gestão de serviços ( Management Services )  devido as varias . Noçoes fiscais por fazer lançamentos e controles de Nota fiscais externas, controles de pagamento, fluxo de caixa . Em relaçao a empresa nada a dizer que desabone ."
good,"CBRE is the biggest for good reason, they have the best depth and breadth of services and resources in their brokerage and corporate services business lines and continue to grow through strategic acquisition globally.  "
good,"CBRE Portfolio Services is a poorly ran department within a properly ran company.  The lack of communication is evident from the top, with the Director of Operations, and trickles down through every facet of leadership.  Changes in procedures are communicated poorly and staff is usually in the dark on what exactly should be happening.  Office morale is at an all time low and turnover is at an all time high."
good,"Typically the day starts at 8 am.  If there is not an early morning meeting to set up the A/V system for, I will begin by reviewing help desk cases in the Service-Now system (SNS) to prioritize.  Thereafter I will look at my emails to see if anything has come in that may not have made it the SNS that needs my attention, they eventually go into the SNS.  I will follow up with customers and see what their availability is like to set reasonable expectations for when I might be able to make it by to provide assistance.  I typically take an hour for lunch and I update my Help Desk cases before leaving around 5 pm."
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
good,"Had an overall unfriendly atmosphere."
good,"I started off as the receptionist/administrative assistant within that scope, I created marketing materials such as Memorandums and offer summaries. Then I was transferred into the Transaction Coordinator role and was happy with working with commissions and payments."
good,I have enjoyed working at CBRE. The people and environment is very welcoming.
good,"There is no such thing as a typical day in my position at CBRE which is part of the fun. Priorities change on the fly as clients need various reports/information etc. Very fast paced stimulating environment where my ability to multi-task and problem solve worked to my advantage. I throughly enjoyed all the challenges and the work environment at CBRE, my co-workers and team members are all amazing people and we are a very cohesive unit and family."
good,They seem to really care. They do many team building projects. Everyone helped each other.
good,"Daily making rounds logging building equipment like our 125 horsepower Cleaver Brooks Boilers , 2 Centrifugal York Compressors 550 ton units . Walking into our Data Center responsible for our 20 ton Liebert Units (crac units) .Repair and Pm of compressors , change oil, filters and dehydrators , leak check , calibrations of controls . Walking into mechancical rooms using your eyes , ears and noise for any faulty conditions . Doing repair work out of our classification to insure satisfaction to our costumers at all times . Costumer Relations is very important . Monitoring building automation system with our Andover Computer System , Watt Stopper for lighting controls , S-Energy for our 20 total Liebert A.C. units , Notifier Fire Panels , Halon and Security"
good,I learned a lot of the basics that you cannot learn from sitting in a classroom.
good,"As a new employee you are not given to the tools to succeed. It's an atmosphere where you need to know someone before joining or understand the business and your role in it very well. Overall, it's an experience you will need to have at least once."
good,"Okay employer...work day busy, learned some skills, coworkers good, when the days ends"
good,"I enjoyed my time at CBRE.   Did feel that I couldn't depend on relationships built with service providers due to $$ being more important that service. "
good,Fun place to work My direct boss is Awsome.Good health benifits.Lots of useless training (Time consuming) Need to know how to use a smart phone to work here(Useless Apps..Once again time consuming) If ya wanna play on a computer this jobs for you..Totally RIP you off on your raises..Always half year late.Someone in Corporate who doesn't know you or how you preform makes raises
good,"Broad range of work opportunities."
good,"CBRE is a good company to work for, but they lack in communications, spending money on repairing equipment that needs repairing and should give bonuses to hourly employee that deserve them."
good,"It was a great place to work, but pay was bad and no room for advancement. I applied for 20 different jobs and I was passed on every single time. Management was ok but to much miscommunications.  They promote the wrong individuals."
good,"Check BMS and CP and towers , preform rounds of equipment check e-mails and work orders. preform preventive Maintenance. Training and safety videos, check AHU's"
good,"Na minha avaliação é uma Empresa básica de manutenção Industrial, onde desempenho minha função de Técnico Mecatrônico."
good,"Great place to start right out of college. CBRE has many opportunities not only in MN but international, if you ever want to relocate. Easy to move the ladder, the people are nice. The only con is that there is not much diversity and the raise are really bad."
good,CBRE fails to properly train its employees for the job in which the employee is expected to perform. Pay increases are yearly with little percentage improvement...most times around 2% annually. No sick time allotted requiring the use of 40 hours of paid time off before short term disability kicks in. CBRE micromanages every aspect of your work environment and is oftentimes over critical with assessments. Human resources is oftentimes unhelpful.
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
good,"A filial brasileira é administrada pelas mesmas pessoas desde a sua abertura na década de 70, o time de presidência e diretoria não aceita os processos de inovação em detrimento das politicas adotadas pela matriz. "
good,The job responsibilities were relaxed and doable.  The company invested generously in equipment and tools.  There was always ample back up support to complete tasks.
good,CBRE was a good company to work for. I wish they could have kept the contract in our area. If not for the lack of the contract I would still be working for them.
good,As a contractor you have two parties to answer to which sometimes can be stressful. There has to be a good balance between them. Corporate is a distant entity that you just hear about.
good,CBRE is a good company to work for.  The Project Management team are a great group of people and are always willing to provide any information to complete the job.
good,"CBRE has been a good place to work. It is a fast paced. I have had the opportunity learn AWS Cloud. Management in my onion is the weakest part of CBRE."
good,"The company has an expiration date for entry-level positions. Not much room for growth and you're lucky if you don't deal with a narcissist every other day."
good,"On the staff side, there is little opportunity for advancement or salary increase. You really need to be a broker and get your real estate license in order to make any money. Workplace culture was really great and people were awesome, but there was always a lot of work to be done and often times it was last-minute deadlines."
good,We have done a lot of work togeather.The team has all moved on.They gave me room to work.The hour were good 7 to 4.Company vechical with gas card and credit cards.Working at CB has been a great experience.
good,"Fun and fast paced work environment... CBRE has several accounts the globe. Regardless of the account, you'll have the opportunity to toward achieving the clients goals."
good,"I've been at the company for years and have learned a lot.  The managers that I've had are very knowledgeable and great trainers.  I've worked with some of the best in this industry and up until a couple of years ago, I enjoyed going to work.  What a difference a change in management can make.  New management is different and very quiet.......some may think quiet is good, but in this case it makes you feel like you are not being kept informed of what's going on with the company.  Most of the time, management turns His head to keep from speaking.  This company is very male-dominated and there's not a lot of diversity - not many female managers in Loan Services - Operations."
good,"I love my immediate manager and my team.  However, the ownership is grueling.  There seems to be a lack of training and a lot of gossip within CBRE as a whole which is really too bad.  I do not feel I have a very good work/life balance.  "
good,"CBRE is a great place to work. Advancement is hard and the pay is below the market. They'll keep piling onto your workload, but won't add anything to your pay...we call it ""the CBRE way!"" I'm sure that's with every company, but seems more so with this one."
good,Bad Management....long hours....have to be a yes man....no real sense of direction from leaders....no help in training to show you the ropes just thrown in the water and hope not to drown!!!
good,"A empresa é ótima, boa cultura organizacional, está a bastante tempo no mercado, possui bons benefícios. Ponto contra: Possibilidade de efetivação baixa, gerência engessada"
good,"The company offers excellent pay and benefits.  However, the job can be very stressful and tedious.  Like any job, the stress level is greatly impacted by your supervisor.  I have had 3 different managers at this company - one was helpful and empathetic with vast knowledge, one was aloof and gave little/no guidance, but was kind, and the other was a micro-manager with little compassion who saw all things in black and white.  My stress level and quality of professional life was best when I had a supervisor who tried to understand me and offered assistance when I felt overwhelmed.  The worst situation was feeling micro-managed when I am such a hard worker and do not need to be babysat."
good,A good company to work for and is willing to train new employees. From Executives to other employees everyone is willing to help you move forward and gain the knowledge you need.
good,"Overall, very flexible with work/life balance. Getting parts/materials make doing your job difficult at times. Coworkers work well with one another."
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
good,"A empresa tem ótimo valores, cultura e visão de negócio. A política""engessada"" dificulta alguns processos internos, além do ambiente de trabalho estressante e problemas de gestão para resolução de conflitos do serviço. O pacote de benefícios é interessante, mas falta investimento nos funcionários e integração entre eles. O ambiente de trabalho é agitado, porém estável e se tem muita autonomia para exercer as atividades."
good,"At CBRE  I’d like to say thank you for the memories, friendship and collaboration in building our Accounting Career for 5 years.  I’ve met many of different culture  in my travels and many more of them virtually and the corporate culture, work ethic and drive to success was amazing and humbling."
good,I enjoyed working at CBRE but I had to work a lot hours a week. I hoed to do a lot overtime. I gained a lot of experience in a short period of time. Unfortunately I wasn't able to have much free time with my family and friends because of the work load.
good,"Used to be a great place to work, but changed since early 2014 whereby the parent company is dominating the local division too much!"
good,Worked really hard for this company due to down sizing.  Did a lot of reports included stats.  Management and co-workers were good.  Hardest part of the job was when you have to train others who are taking over your positions.
good,"Typical day at work is a lot of phone calls coming in as well as e-mails.  I learned how to multi-task doing this job for the last 3 years.  My co-workers are the best group of people who provide needed coverage to ensure that requests are seen through to completion.  Our management does not get involved with our day-to-day duties unless there is something new that comes to the workplace and we need to be made aware of.  We manage and run our own team and we have gained our managements trust.  The hardest part of the job is when new processes come in and we have to combine them with our normal day-to-day responsibilities.  Our team has learned to split the work, this way all requests get completed fully and our clients are happy.  Teamwork is what is the most enjoyable part of my job.  We put our minds together and our day goes by stress free, knowing that our customers have been taken care of"
good,"With this company, I have learned quite a bit about the real estate accounting role.  The company has a fairly solid training system/support program.  You will always have others around that you can consult with if you run into problems.  Once you start to show that you are self-sufficient and are a problem solver, you will quickly be loaded up with more and more properties.  The work load can be overwhelming at times, and the company typically does not allow overtime since accountants are hourly until they reach the Sr. level.  The hardest part of the job is once you show you know what you are doing, it is your job to pick up all of the slack from the other accountants who are either behind due to too much work, or to pick up properties from accountants who have left the company.  This company has a very high turnover in accountants and has low moral due to low compensation."
good,Fast paced critical environment facility. No room for mistakes.
good,"CBRE's RISE values and the CBRE mission statement is the overall reason behind the company's success with their clients. However, those values and the mission statement does not necessary hold true with the support they give to their employees. The HR department does not have the friendliest group of individuals."
good,Fielding phone calls and emails from clients and REMs is a large part of the day. The entire month builds up to the month end report.
good,I liked the fact that I was able to make decisions on issues concerning my portfolio and would take responsibility for them. I worked with minimum supervision with a lot of flexibility.
good,Good work environment. Strong management team. Competitive pay. A overall good place to work. I recommend job seekers to consider CBRE as a potential employer.
good,A empresa é excelente em relação á equilibrio de vida. Porem o salário é um pouco abaixo do mercado.
good,They definitely have their favorites in this company who get taken care of by management.  Everyone is somewhat expendable.   Management never really cared about my career.
good,"3 Stars because the job depends on the account.  The Client dictates the workload, pay and management, not CBRE. CBRE is basically the ""middleman.""  There are chances to transfer within the company. I transferred within the company to a much less stressful account with higher pay."
good,"Your employment is at the mercy of CBRE's clients for continued employment. Great culture, Great coworkers, Many jobs available if your willing to relocate."
good,"workplace to learn more on part of job, culture, and peoples in management."
good,"This was a satellite office that managed a business park. The Property Manager was very supportive, patient, and eager to teach and help her employees grow.  Everyone that worked at this location took pride in their job because they were treated with the utmost respect."
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
good,"CBRE is a leader in its industry and it rewards its leaders and high performers for strong performance. This is a great company for ambitious, hard working people who are good at communicating their value and contributions."
good,"o	Responsible for managing Citi bank account in Egypt as the account head."
good,I like what I do but the pay for what they demand from me isn't high enough. I'm the only forklift mechanic for 2 facilities one of which is 24hrs. I also have to do building maintenance and repairs there is too much to do and not enough time or people to do it all.
good,"Management should be up to date when training on SOP and other procedures are revised. once that occur , they should pass on the information to the team members. this is very useful and would show our customer their information is being passed on correctly. should also show more leadership amongst the group and ensure all issue are addressed or try to find answer in a timely manner for the team."
good,Well working for cbre has been great and I have learnt alot and also aquired some skills that can be applied in my professioal life as well as my private life.
good,I went in at 4am to start up the building to ensure upon tenants arrival the temp was comfortable. I would then check readings and equipment and make my rounds. I would then once the 2nd person arrived start on pm and during the course of the day handle all incoming work orders in a timely manor and keep the chief Engineer and our tenants up dated. I would also work on out standing work orders and close them out and up date the system. The biggest thing I learned is to stay focused on your work and complete it so you don't get backed up and get overwhelmed. Management did the best they could . I enjoyed working with all my co-workers we were a team and they were all a hard working bunch of guys. Work was only hard if there were mechanical break downs or computer issues. I enjoyed my job and meeting new tenants and our work place events but honestly the best part of the day is always going home to my family
good,CBRE has a strong customer focus and a very strong corporate culture.  Client satisfaction is the primary goal and messaging from Senior Leadership is consistent with corporate strategic targets and values.
good,la position du service financer pour CBRE France présente quelque lacune managériale un turn over important depuis quelques années.
good,"My tenure with CBRE was rewarding one & the way it had started with a positive note, the same way it has ended. I have all the good memories say except some minute issues which one would find everywhere . Given a chance, i would surely love to re-join the company again."
good,I spent most of my time outside of the office seeking and closing deals.  CBRE did provide some benefits.  I was an employee not a contractor. My job was eliminated due to a merger.
good,"You'll most likely enjoy the people you work with, and the training for the overall department is usually decent, but not typically relative to the daily duties; there is very little training on the processes you use day in and day out, some processes are so complex and all over the place, successful results are really unobtainable."
good,"It was good steady employment. Middle management caused a lot of problems with lower level employees. Nice work environment. Pay was sufficient, but not competitive ."
good,"CBRE Affordable Housing is great for those who love to take initiative for their own growth within the organization. The culture of the group is a work hard, play harder environment with a cut-throat mentality. It's a great place to learn about real estate and work with a group of people that like to have fun, but have high expectations for the work that is delivered."
good,"There are several different cultures within CBRE.  However, the Consulting Group is full of ambitious and smart people that provides some sanity to the chaos that is the leasing broker world."
good,"Trabalho em equipe, sistema integrado super bem desenvolvido, colaboradores responsáveis, atendimento ao cliente com total dedicação e respeito."
good,Learnt Property Management on the job. Very systematic and organised processes. Great environment to work at.. Take pride in being a part of CBRE.
good,"OK place to work, not much room for advancement. The supervisory structure is awful. You can never get a hold of a manager when you need on."
good,CBRE offers a lot of training. I enjoy working there and the benefits are really good. I have learned a lot at CBRE and I have met a lot of different individuals. There is not one day that is the same. I always get to experience something new.
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
good,Great Work Culture. Got to learn team management and risk management. I could learn alot from the Project Management firm
good,"Good people to work with and benefits are good. Days can be long."
good,"Pros: The people are friendly and make a tedious day bearable. Benefits are good and the amount of holiday and PTO time is good. "
good,"Muy profesionales,aprendí mucho, me forme en gestión interna de equipos y a escuchar a cada compañero para poder obtener la mayor productividad de cada uno."
good,alot of weekend work and overtime. there are alot of pms per month that have to be completed
good,My typical day of work consist of setting up PM's and repairs for my guys on my shift. Report and record completions and findings on equipment. Fill out soft copies and make sure the guys are doing their jobs safely and efficiently. I am the Lead on my shift.
good,"CBRE's Management and communication need Help. Some things are being said but nothing being done to assess the problems. No one on ones or voices being heard. No Employee input to solutions."
good,"Was able to work remotely but lots of travel. Flexibility to work anywhere. Challenging to take time off. Great benefits and compensation. Client unreasonable at times, would not commit to contract SLA."
good,"This is an international company and it shows with its corporate level. Very motivating environment and pushes employees to work harder, creating healthy competition. Social culture with lots of young employees."
good,CBRE isn't a bad company at all. It has great benefits and paid time off. The General Manager is understanding in certain situations. he does compromise and understand your situations. The only problem at that building is seniority and the feel they have to micromanage officers finding issues to react on. The pay is ok you only receive 33 cents every year depending on your evaluation.
good,Enjoyed working with the CBRE management team (at that time) and the other accountants.  Relatively relaxed work environment; month end could be challenge.
good,"Team Management"
good,"The work load per person is far too great, they have rapidly expanded their portfolio but failed go expand the work force at the same rate. The people who work there are great, welcoming and very professionall just over worked."
good,"no security. the job itself is great but as soon as they loose a contract, your notice will be send out. management are great. workforce itself is ok."
good,Revenue driven company. company invests money into platform updates.  limited ability to advance to other areas of the company and within the valuation department.
good,"Hard working and demanding environment with tight deadlines. However, department staff are great to work with. CBRE provides multiple opportunities for training and industry education and hosts entertaining, quarterly networking opportunities for management teams and vendors to get to know each other."
good,As a supervisor I wear many hats and people ask me questions all day long.  I really enjoy this aspect as I love helping whenever I can. I have three direct reports and two are brand new accountants so I get to mentor them. The client I am currently working on is a large publically traded company so it has been fast paced and much more complicated than any other or our 600 clients.  I have succeeded in meeting this challenge and as a result have gained valuable knowledge.
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
good,"CBRE is a great company to work for, but each site is different.  This one is one of the lowest paying for non-managerial positions based on the city standard for these positions, and raises are never more than cost of living never on merit (according to management) which I think is normal with the ups and downs of the economy.  Also promotions rarely take place within this property for engineering.  It is a well known fact at CBRE to move up you need to move.  "
good,"Typically , my day starts with reviewing project progress and status across geographically diverse locations. As the day progresses , i collaborate with global and local stake holders on various project matters - Strategic & Tactical"
good,Resources are at your fingertips but finding it is a completely different matter.  Good name and there are a lot of opportunities.
good,"A great place to work, the work environment is friendly and Managementi is always there for support."
good,It is really good to have such company to work. But whoever willing to work there should have clear mindset that they will have appreciation but no rewards.
good,Great company to work for every day is different and exciting.  People lead organisation being in the service sector and always striving to innovate to be ahead of the competitors
good,Cisco is a high demand client that was not very flexible with contractor employees. Although they encourage team building events; they also demand 60+ hours a week.
good,"You are basically on your on to learn, there is limited training you are thrown into clients knowing nothing. you have to be a fast learner or you are not going to make it unless you know someone."
good,"The work environment was relaxed and the teams like to have fun. Work life balance is about average. It is important to the company but it is also expected to put in over time in order to get things done. Management has been good, but compensations and benefits could be better (compared to similar jobs/employers)."
good,"The hardest part of the job:Contracted work on customer account. The business cycles can be very up and down working with fixed and O &M budgets."
good,"CBRE pays below market and requires employees to complete a lot of work.  However, most employees are hourly.  This means that the work-life balance is better because you are generally working only 40 hours a week.  On the other side, you are expected to complete work that should sometimes take more than 40 hours a weekk."
good,"empresa tradicional, seria, idônea."
good,I'm based on a client account and the culture is dependent on what client you are with. CBRE itself provides a lot of room for growth and movement but your happiness all comes down to your manager.
good,"The big companies have their own ways of doing things, so some things here are not honored here as they would be for a smaller company would. But great employees and great bosses."
good,"Great place to work if you have the proper experience.  At times it was hard to move around to alternate positions within the company.   The company offers excellent benefits, this is by far the best asset from CBRE."
good,"Manages all phases of recruitment, including defining hiring management needs and posting their positions"
good,"Great place to work and a god learning place.The culture is very good.Top management is very supportive."
good,"The environment is good but the work schedule is very strict. If you leave even an hour early you have to ask for permission and have someone cover your inbox while you are out. Co-workers are great, work as a team to achieve a common goal. You don't learn much accounting but you do develop amazing communication skills since you are constantly emailing other regions and on answering their calls."
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
good,"Working with CBRE was a great experience due to the management support and encouragement to see their employees grow."
good,"You work with all types of personalities and have to be able to prioritize your work.  You have to learn the building inside and out and coordinate schedules with Engineer, Porters, etc.."
good,"This was not a fun place to work.  I worked for CBRE Property Management. I love my job but the team was not a team.  It was a hard place to be.  The manager picked and he and two other employees were very close and I was at the front desk, they were all in the back office (Managers office and mailroom) they stuck together and ran the show."
good,The company provided money for employees to take classes and training to develop skills. They did provide a benefits package but for what you pay it leaves something to desire and could be alot better.
good,A good company with standardized process. Have the authority to control the overall project & the stakeholders involved.
good,"Because the department was in transition (both functional and systems), management was not able to fully utilize the talent that was assigned to assist in the day to day tasks.  There was often downtime with nothing getting done.  There was a general feeling of boredom.  Otherwise, it was a very pleasant and fun place to work.  Both management and staff were congenial.  Management very much encouraged teamwork by hosting company paid lunches and other offsite social activities.  And yes, there really was a ping pong table."
good,I can't speak for any other department but the is a place of dysfunction the management is out of touch with the employees and it is the direct reporting Supervisors stir up a lot of confusion and the consequences are never seen.
good,"The hardest and the most satisfying is working with clients. Clients can be wonderful and difficult at times. The hardest part is management,  they do not give credit for your experience and long hours."
good,"As a field project manager, there is no set schedule.  "
good,"CBRE is a wonderful place to work. The RISE values are directly in line with people who take their morals and ethics seriously. CBRE has many faces and responsibilities. Working as part of the GWS side of CBRE and working for a particular account can be challenging as there is not much room for advancement or family/work life balance. If you need to take a day off, it can be a tough situation as usually there isn't any one to cover your position. If you need to pick up a child from school it can be difficult as they don't like being flexible on hours worked. But overall, great company."
good,"Everything depends on the site. Larger and older the site bigger the headache. Also, the team at the site is really important. However, the corporate office seems nice."
good,The people work hard and play hard. They heavily focus on community service and allow time off in the week to participate.
good,Everyone just did there job during the work day. We were at the office to work. Most of the time people including myself were to busy to talk.
good,"Consultoria prestada a empresa L'oreal."
good,"While the company culture was great when I hired on, the recent culture appears to be bottom-line driven.  I did enjoy working there for my +10 years, where I was brought in to analyze the existing problems within our division, and given the freedom to determine how best to make system and process improvements to rectify them."
good,"Given my position was part of an acquisition, It took a long time to get assimilated especially as a remote worker. Likewise, the development of a business plan for our business segment was not a high priority, as a result numbers did not support the continuation of our efforts and led to job elimination."
good,Typical day at work was very monotonous but still i learned a lot of new skills. Although the management was good they were hardly interacting on a frequent basis as i was a site resource. Culture at workplace was good but was time consuming. The most enjoyable part was the team.
good,The environment was very quiet and peaceful. There was never any animosity between coworkers and most everybody got along quite well there. for an office job it was very nice although I'm not the type of person to sit around all day.
good,Real Estate Managers lack managing people skills.  Each out for his own.  No team work. Do not go to HR with concerns.  It will only make matters uncomfortable and probably get you fired eventually.
good,L'azienda sta subendo una rioraganizzazione globale imposta dalla casa madre che non le sta giovando.
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
good,"Precisa melhorar muito, só pensa em conseguir clientes e esquece dos funcionários"
good,"Prezados,"
good,Đây là nơi làm việc rất tốt đối với tất cả các bạn sinh viên mới ra trường.
good,Its a good company but needs a little less politics. Management typically look for their own benefit. there isn't much training which i believe in very necessary.
good,"Good place to learn new things , management is very back and forth , they hire young people with no skill, they do give u training classes, is a first shift driven company"
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, pero falta cultura y cohesion interna"
good,"Well paid, but overworked staff.  Management allows unrealistic expectations from users.  Highly skilled technicians, but non-technical managers/directors."
good,"I wasn't  at CBRE for too long due to being offered an other role in another company. The paralegal department was very unstable due to the manager at the time.  CBRE is overall a great company to work for, I didn't enjoyed my time there due my boss at the time.  However, I would definitely work for CBRE in again if the opportunity would present itself.  The worse part of my day was having to be belittle by my boss publicly but the best times were having to help my team and courage them to be their best."
good,"Empresa com uma ótima dinâmica, onde procura sempre o melhor para o funcionário, boa gerência."
good,Everything was fine except the salary and lack of respect for the colleagues. readyto work in different fields related to civil.
good,"Basically, work a lot and get a lot of experience. Hierarchical company, task oriented. Good place to learn, not so good to live."
good,"The AOC Department handles calls from all over the world."
good,"Good company, but many functions are now US controlled. The company has essentially 2 division Corporate Brokerage and Facility Services"
good,Global Forecasting Planning and Analysis. International Capital Expenditure Quarterly Reporting.
good,"Cbre is a big name in pmc but they only do is documentation.. Even a bcom graduate can work there as a project manager since they only do is documentation, check list, permits, n more papers... N more paper work... If you are an engineer who is technical minded and knowledgeable this place will frustrate you."
good,Great company culture. Management not approachable at times and when they were the discussions were mediocre. Not a lot of room for growth opportunities and pay did not meet requirements of job.
good,"As with many large companies, policy interpretation and culture are set by the resident management team."
good,"A diretoria de uma das empresas do grupo tem um boa visão de equipe e é acessível a todos, não sei se isso se cumpre para todas as empresas do grupo. Conviver diretamente com o time global é uma experiência enriquecedora."
good,I believe the upper management fails to see the good in its talented people and I saw many leaving due to management. I was asked to perform a job that was only tasking me with a 10th of my overall skills and industry knowledge.  I was pushed to produce more than one person without an assistant could do within a work week with out working nights and weekends to meet my supervisors goals for me.
good,"Very stressful"
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
good,"A typical day is good, multi-tasked and made new friends. I learned to be quick with getting proper information to clients. Management was laid back and was not too professional. My co-workers were very nice. The hardest part was getting the proper training I needed but the manager didn't seem to care. The most enjoyable was working on projects that were assigned to me."
good,"Very smart business model with unlimited growth, very ambitious and progressive, continually seeking new lines of revenue, very fast paced in many different aspects. The company will continue to be the largest commercial real estate company in the world if it continues it's course."
good,worked for cbre for 2 yrs and 3 months. when contract with client was over...I was ousted without any help in locating a new job within the company.
good,"Arun rewal Associates had nice work culture with main focus in creativity, design & detailing."
good,Salary levels are low and opportunities for advancement are limited for females.
good,Overall CBRE are a good company to work for. The pay is really good and the overtime rate even better. I personally learned alot that I can now use in my future endeavors. The only downside is the communication is not very good within certain contracts and management are very hard to get a hold of. They are almost too important to speak to anyone and respond to emails.
good,"Dünya sektör lideri bir firma olduğunu kapısından adım atınca anlıyorsunuz ancak Türkiye pazarında yeni olduğu için proje odaklı çalışan bir firma. Kısaca kurumsal kültürü olan ancak henüz uygulamada başarılı olamayan bir firma.Firmanın kendi kuralları ve prensipleri olsa da yönetimindeki projeye göre her şey esnek. Her ne kadar kurumsal ve yurtdışı bağlantılı olarak lanse edilse de firmanın kurumsallık adına daha çok yol alması gerekli. Bunun başlıca sebebi de firmanın Türkiye pazarında yeni olması ve yönetmekte olduğu projelerdeki müşterilerinin de etkisi büyük. Önemli bir nokta da projede yönetim ekibinde yukarı ile ne kadar iyi ilişki kurarsanız o kadar rahat edersiniz. "
good,So boring. Waiting for something to go wrong so we could fix it. Ended up doing post rather than maintaince. Team was good. Manager good. Need to be more structure.
good,"Maintenance Engineer (Core stores) I carry out planned maintenance at 6 core stores in the South London area, working within a small team responding to minor maintenance requests and reactive or urgent maintenance issues as they arise.  "
good,Great company to work for.  Great people that you work with. Very nice location in the downtown area. Restaurants are very nice and would recommend CBRE to friends and family members.
good,Yes they will Micro manage you but the toughest is Micro Class Room Testing you Monthy and only give you 1 hour per month other wise its your responsbility to finish it on your time while claiming it's given time.
good,"Have really enjoyed my time with the company though customer account changes can lead to diminished job security, but that is the nature of the business."
good,"Commission jobs are always risky, make sure you have a solid team before committing or low cost of living so you can survive at least 2 years with no or little pay."
good,Small team and very cliquish. Dominated by a certain group of women. Desire to see a diversity of men and nationalities. Growth is limited and the team is Cliquish. Real Estate managers are over worked.
good,It was difficult to work for a company that didn't have any real guidance.  After the on site director left we were supervised remotely and wasn't really supported very well.
good,"Empresa dinâmica e agradável de trabalhar, colaboradores focados em resultados e com bons benefícios."
good,"Mostly unsupervised work day.  "
good,"Aside from the steadily increasing workload with no real hope of a raise, the work and the people were good. I enjoyed assisting clients and working with them through specific problems. The work felt meaninfgul. Got a job related injury and they relocated me to a position where I'd be able to work while I was on doctor's restrictions. They seemed to like to promote from within, which is good, but I know they passed over someone for a management position who was completely qualified. Performance-review based raises seemed to not be as great as it would seem. Only one person actually got a raise and it was 1%. I took on the work of another person when their job was eliminated and my pay was not changed to reflect that. Just seemed like a lot of ""what else can you do for us"" without any reasonable increase in pay or benefits."
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
good,I learned how harsh the commercial real estate situation can be.  I received two weeks notice that my position was being eliminated due to the properties that I serviced had been sold.
good,"Empresa não tem Gestão de Pessoas, não se preocupa com o funcionário."
good,CBRE is a better than average company to work for. Overall CBRE is a very competitive real estate management company. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I work with.
good,"It's a good company to work for stability wise, but since it's so large there is no personal connection. You are just a number. For such a large company, you'd think they'd offer more affordable health insurance options and 401k matching."
good,"Higher ups done follow RISE values. Very disrespectful to team members. Create lies to remove or demote employees. "
good,"A typical work was very busy."
good,I worked there for 4 years. Favoritism and nepotism ran rampid. Lots of covering up safety issues and private use of funds. When you try to advance they find ways of preventing you then give jobs to friends or family.
good,Very competitive but acceptable.  Required self starting characteristics and much tenacity.  Income directly related to time put in.  Initial training good.
good,"CBRE employees are very professional and have a welcoming environment. However, ""Brokers"" are predominantly white males and blacks are highly underrepresented."
good,good company..some very nice people to work with..some not..But you get that in any company you work for..Large company to work for...I really can't say to much about this company..so I'll keep the rest to myself..
good,"Overall CBRE is a great company to work for if you desire job stability. Career growth is extremely hard to navigate with this company.  It seems like external candidates get more opportunities then internal candidates.  CBRE states they like to promote within, however that has not been my experience.  The company has grown so large that the personal touch to the employees has been lost. I wish the company would invest in professional development training for managers.  The interpersonal relations are lacking and it drives employees to quit."
good,"CBRE is a decent company to work for. There is a shortage of commercial real estate firms in Memphis. CB helps fill the void. If your experience is relevant, apply"
good,"The office I worked in is no longer in operation."
good,"Good growth opportunity within Healthcare division, however lack of accountability by management for the treatment of employees by Alliance Directors.  Poor behavior at that level was not addressed."
good,CBRE is a good place to work with excellent teamwork and strong commitment to ethics.  Management and co-workers are all very supportive of each other and work well together.
good,"Our deep experience and expertise allows us to paint a precise picture of global commercial real estate conditions and trends. It allows us to recognize opportunities quickly and take advantage of them."
good,"As part of the asset management team, we are responsible for managing high call and email volume simultaneously."
good,"I just stayed for a consultancy project as part of my Master degree. The team was helpful, young and dynamic and the work was fun as we have been let free to make a market research for the hotel sector."
good,"CBRE is a great company to work for if you would career in real estate. "
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
good,"Assessed client needs and developed customized solutions to ensure consistent satisfaction"
good,"The work I did involved a lot of travel and flexible hours. Holidays were always fun because we were allowed to decorate our areas and most of the staff joined in. However work always goes to the lowest cost. The culture is to lay off workers and then hire new ones at a lower wage. They consider everyone expendable. I had one co-worker who was able to get 15 years, but I was laid off after 8 and my other co-worker only made 3 years."
good,The company culture is great. Very good the professionals working in the company
good,"Productive and fast paced. "
good,"CBRE is a very large company with many opportunities for professional growth. There are great technology tools and resources, as well as global brand recognition."
good,"A CBRE é uma empresa muito agradável de se trabalhar, é uma empresa dinâmica, valoriza seus funcionários, tem valores , respeito, integridade e excelência."
good,Excellent corporate culture. Lots of room for advancement. Company is huge. Proper training is provided. Workload is pretty heavy so good time management skills are required.
good,"Corporate environment, fun place to work in. Really enjoyed it. Money was great, was not really appreciated until I left but am still happy I had the experience to work there."
good,"Was there in a contract position, so not all applied to me.  My co-workers did not seem all that happy as far as support for their roles went.  All in all I enjoyed my time spent there and would consider working for the company full time should the opportunity arise."
good,"The common day will involve close communications with leadership as well as client, individuals will be asked to work outside of comfort zones and levels to develop necessary skillsets to move on to bigger and better opportunities"
good,"other then the micro managment it is overall a great place to work. there a good sence of culture. typically work a regular shift, but sometimes you are called in just incase pf emergencies."
good,"I was an mobile engineer initially and was promoted to Chief.  However, under paid as Chief and not much of an opportunity to advance.  My Supervisor was blocking any type of transfer internally that I was interested in for my personal advancement.  He since was terminated for these actions, but I had already moved on to a job outside of CBRE."
good,"We are often short handed but managers are very good"
good,"Days are always full of PM's to keep the building in top running order. We do everything for the base building from havc, fire life safety, and electrical. We work close with the client to keep a good handle on small issues that pop up in between PM's"
good,A typical day review / reconcile accounts receivable and revenue reports. I would cover the helpdesk hotline to answer any internal or external calls or emails. The workplace was very strict .
good,"1. It was very productive and the tools were always there for us to use."
good,"Never know what a typical day consists of as there were so many things that could happen. "
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
good,the work environment was great. is a little hectic. working extra hours to get the job done. the employees are great working with. pay is a little on the downside.
good,"Leuke teams, veel verantwoordelijkheid en zelfstandigheid."
good,the Challenging tasks keep it interesting and it is never boring.  Executive management always wants to make sure employees are happy with their work life balance.
good,"Short interim role but did a lot of work with CBRE as a supplier in many of my roles.  A quality company, but like a lot of places it all depends on the people there. I would rate the company well based on my experiences."
good,a quality company dedicated to meeting their KPI's and providing a quality end product to the BP Client at all costs. Strong leadership with mixed goals is creating a negative impact of staff.
good,The workplace culture here wasn't for me but I did get  a good start into the commercial real estate industry and made some contacts to be able to move on.
good,"Even though it's a large worldwide company, if you are in the right department and position there is a small company feel.  The pay and benefits do not meet the demands of the jobs and company."
good,"Working on accounts are very varied. Great opportunity for promotion and skill building, but not without a business case. CBRE consistently oversells the client and underperforms due to horrible set up of new accounts. This makes jobs very unstable and performing to client expectations close to impossible, if not impossible. But CBRE is loyal and moves people around rather than let people leave."
good,"The CBRE office I worked at was very competitive, but the people were very nice! Although, as an Intern, I worked practically as the full-time receptionist on an intern salary. Through the year and a half I worked there I did not learn much, it was mostly answering/directing phone calls and cleaning."
good,"As a contractor the management made no difference between the fulltime CBRE employee and contractors."
good,CBRE is a global company which requires all employees to multi task at a very fast pace. An enjoyable part of the job is meeting people from around the world.
good,Great work family friendly work environment. You have the option to participate in different affinity groups and volunteer opportunity. This is a fast pace work environment.
good,"Bonne structure, bonne ambiance, bonne condition de travail"
good,"In Consulting - Days start usually late, because you were in office till late last night."
good,I was only a summer intern at this position so there isn't much valuable information I can add here. It's a massive company with offices all over the world and one of the more prestigious real estate firms in the world.
good,"Good work environment; No overtime, collaborative culture; accessible supervisors; good work/life balance; willing to take your input into account; self starter/self management required"
good,As the borough industrial market dwindled along with development I wished to change my interest to office and not for profit leasing in the Manhattan office however that never materialized and other opportunities came up
good,"Fun place to work, everybody I have ever met has been very kind and easy going. I would reccomend this company to anybody looking for a new and exciting career."
good,"Working as a consultant, you can move from client to client, so there are plenty of opportunities to learn different processes and procedures. Also, being a consultant gives you a chance to move on to another client if it's just not a good fit."
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
good,"CBRE Group, Inc. is the largest commercial real estate services and investment firm in the world. It is based in Los Angeles, California and operates more than 450 offices worldwide and has clients in more than 100 countries."
good,I have enjoyed 2 years with CBRE and a typical work day is challenging.  I have learned a lot with more to learn.  You have the opportunity to get involved in many area's and the people are great to work with.
good,"I enjoyed working for CBRE, they have many gathering activities which allows you to know many more people outside of your inner circle of your daily co-workers you work with."
good,CBRE is a good company to work unless you have a bad manager like our new manager. He has made 100 Congress a terrible work enviroment. 00 Congress before he arrived here was hands down the best building in Austin to work at.
good,"CBRE is a sufficient place to work however this is contract work and you are limited by the customer of what can be done or accomplished.  I find the position challenging and not very rewarding, since the lack of management understanding of the technology and and how it works with buildings."
good,"I spent a week at the CBRE offices as part of my school work experience, everyone was friendly and supported and especially patient with me as I helped with their work"
good,"CBRE is a great company to work for.  I recommend this company to anyone. I have enjoyed my 7 years with them and would love to stay with the company, but the drive is too much for may anymore."
good,"réel possibilité d apprentissage"
good,"I would classify CBRE as old school corporate company where politics play a big part in your success.  Very professional with limited activities from the company for team building and morale boosters.  Overall good quality of people, learning opportunities and room for advancement."
good,No loyalty to the employees of middle management.  Profit over quality was more important.  Staff were a commodity.  Too many promise broken.  Should have had stronger management.
good,There is a lot of responsibility as a Real Estate Administer and inadequate support for the amount of work expected to complete. It is a very friendly work environment and a lot of extra-curriculum activities to get involved in.
good,"- Very tough to advance your career with CBRE. They like to hire from the outside instead of promoting with in. "
good,"I really like the company but recently there have been some organizational changes within my line of business that seem short term in thinking and rash in execution.  I'm no longer assured of job security and the culture went from positive, entrepreneurial, and exciting to negative, uncertain, stifling and stressful so I'm looking to make a change.  There are other service lines within the company that function wonderfully."
good,"This is a great work place. It is very competitive, but the benefits are great and people are generally very nice. It is a very fast paced environment and great for someone who is gifted in multi-tasking."
good,Great company to work for. New FM has complicated things on the account that I am on. If a good offer comes along I will probably take it. If the FM leaves the account I will stay.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is making sure every customer is satisfied and that their needs have been met. I enjoy working with my fellow co-workers and management team.
good,"A place to work.  As with any place, the good or bad depends on the quality of the communication between the customer, the managers and you.  The job and expectations can not detailed without that clear communication."
good,"I ended my career at CBRE in the property management division. This was during the Great Recession when companies/tenants were going bankrupt and turning in their keys. Very difficult to daily watch family business disappear overnight, building owners collapse, and a general depressing time."
good,"Empresa, com longa história desde sua criação e fusões com outras grandes empresas do mercado Europeu e Americano. "
good,"one of the largest real estate brokers nationwide. a great company to work at, with lots of team events, being recognized for working hard, and a great atmosphere"
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
good,Good Company to work for work with good people. I have worked at a number of different locations as well as mobile services.
good,Employee focused company in a client-served industry.  Senior management very supportive (HR not so much). 24/7 IT support is a nice touch.
good,"New Learning is very Less"
good,A typical day at CBRE is wonderful. My coworkers invited me as family the moment I started working there. The feeling was amazing knowing that someone really cared on how I felt. I've learned that every voice matters working in the building here at CBRE. Management encourages their team to strive to keep a continuous smile on our faces. The most enjoyable part here at CBRE is that you interact with different people and that they show their appreciation by awarding snacks and great compliments on a daily basis.

good,Became an expert at reconcilation at CB Ricard Ellis by cleaning up all the Lease GAAP Schedules and processing all the adjusting journal entries for the corrections.  Worked with a great team there and we enjoyed monthly themed potlucks to keep things fun.
good,"Great people, great vision.  The necessary evil is that CBRE makes revenue through services - or selling those services.  Therefore, the top 10% of the producers run the company and unwittingly bind leadership to staying in the same place.  Forever."
good,"CBRE is a great company if you want to climb the old corporate ladder. In my opinion they are a very ""old school"" corporation that does not leave much room for innovation."
good,"I thrive in challenging environments in the Facilities Management field. I enjoy working with people and building relationships that are key to having a successful organization. In my current position, I've learned that managing multiple locations has helped my grow immensely as a professional. That said, working as an remote employee had been challenging for me,"

Every month I am responsible for preventative maintenance of equipment, which could be pumps,fans,Crac units, cooling towers etc. I have been certified in OSHA 10 hour course, I posses a Universal Refrigerant card from the EPA.

good,I liked working for CBRE it was great to interact with tenants
good,Learned many technical skills that were transferable into any job going forward.

Frustrating when I can not actually do Electricians work because power can't be shut off usually because it will disrupt Clients business or no labels on breaker panels. Grateful for work and thankful for support from Manager and Team leader as well as co-workers. Very satisfying when I can complete a Work Order and satisfy the client.

good,"Excellent place to work, great benefits and a well established organization overall. There are plenty of opportunities to move about the company, so if your initial choice in role isn't your cup of tea you can post to another position after 1 year of service."
good,"If you are looking for a corporate job in the area of commercial real estate, CBRE is an incredible place to work. However, it is one of the most siloed institutions I have ever worked in, simply because it is so large, and it can be difficult to figure out where exactly your next step would be or potential areas to expand your career. "
good,I worked in lease Administration in the Dallas area the manager I work for I didn't care for too much was a helicopter manager. The company is known for underpaying its administrative staff

good,Empresa prestadora de serviços em que as atividades e programação são definidas pelo contratante. Bom ambiente de trabalho e bom relacionamento entre a equipe.
good,Able to develop my finance management skills and expand knowledge of new software for facility management services.  CBRE had lots of training opportunities.  Sometimes the constant conference calls hindered getting daily work completed by required deadlines.
good,"I enjoy working with the talented coworkers here. The work is consistent with sporadic time for lunch. There is some micromanagement, but you take it with a grain of salt. For the most part, everyone is expected to be professional."
good,"Overall CBRE was a good place to work.  You're able to remote two days a week, flexible schedule, good people, and get a bonus if you're salaried and meet expectations. The bad is if you're salaried you can work 45-50 hours every week and closet to 60 during reporting, low pay for what is expected. If you get stuck with a bad manager its a very stressful situation."
good,"Large company with great training and development opportunities.  Talented and passionate colleagues, great place to learn about all facets of real estate."

good,"Great company, not so great co-workers. I worked on a contract the CBRE took over. They were technicians ""grandfathered"" in when I was hired to support the the new account. Unfortunately the old crew was very cliquish, and ruin the contract through selfish and greedy ways in regards to OT. Pay was low too, because of these guys"
good,Tive como conhecer o mercado de serviços e comercialização de imóveis por 5 anos e foi onde iniciei no mercado imobiliário.

good,"Able to manage my own time with scheduling my own work with my customers. Most customers are local, but my territory covers Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio.  Some trips may be further distance."
good,"The hardest part of the job is that you work for different clients doing outsourced real estate work.  Your future is only as secure as the contract with the client.  Job stability is not a plus, but CBRE's company values are admirable."
good,No room for advancement from trainee position. After change in property management companies at building was decided to downsize. Am open to future positions within this same company.
good,"Worked with a great team and we worked well together, operating as a single unit to meet and exceed the requirements of the client; however, environment began to change under new leadership and opinions and recommendations of team were no longer considered valuable.  New senior management refused to consider recommendations to meet needs of client unless proposed by senior management, rather than history and engagement of support staff with client."
good,"CBRE has many positions around the world, I work as a contractor performing calibrations and maintenance for a large Pharma company.  As a contractor you are always a second class citizen.   In this role with CBRE I really had no contact with the larger corporation.  The pay and benefits are good, and overall the job is good but overwhelming sometimes.  I can say that overall CBRE is a good company, but your experience depends on what part of the company you're working in."
good,"Other than salary, it was a good experience.  Did not like the amount of traveling that was needed.  Feel a lot of it was not necessary.  Had to often figure out job yourself, which I didn't mind."
good,"Productive, fun place workplace with ping pong table."
good,"Each team is really its own company within CBRE, thus can be very difficult to cross-train and get support outside of your immediate team. Make sure you have a clear understanding of your team's roles and any potential for career advancement."
good,"Customer did not like CBRE, this made things intolerable. CBRE was a good company to work for and tried its best to please a unpleasable customer. A min. word answer is ridiculous!"
good,"The whole company is not this way, but I received no recognition for efforts above and beyond and no growth assistance or opportunity within my group, long hours and high stress in an environment that is rich with back-patting friendships rewards"
good,"Beautiful office and mostly friendly faces. A lot of 'locker room talk' and drama between some sales brokers. "
good,Good environment to work.  This employer puts the members first by providing up today equipment. They have lots of opportunities there for member to transfer in to new positions.
good,Learn a lot if you apply yourself but limited advancement. A typical work day could go from very slow to very stressful and fast paced. The workplace culture is very friendly but has gotten worse.
good,"CBRE is a good firm however, those working at the property level will be released or picked up by another company (maybe) if they lose the assignment.  It's just the nature of the industry."
good,Great opportunity unless CBRE loses the account you are on and then you are on your own. CBRE recruiting is slow and do not show concern with placing those that are displaced from an account at no fault of their own.
good,"Good company to create a base in real estate , Lots of learning experiences during my tenure in cbre , amazing company to work with but no scope for growth"
good,"they want you to be safe, management are laid back but yet professional and will have each individual workers best interests to heart, they will look after you"
good,"Technically I was only a temp, but I worked there for over a year so I got to know it pretty well. I was right in the center of the Financial District in San Francisco, CBRE is definitely the biggest Real Estate in the city it seems. There is definitely room for climbing the ladder but it's a tough and stressful job, depending on how many buildings you maintain and manage. My supervisor was stress inducing and wanted me to work way harder than they were paying me for, so I ultimately left. Other than that though I mostly enjoyed my time"
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
good,It is typically busy at work and usually alot going on. In my team to get ahead you have to go drinking with the boss but for the most part the culture is good. The hardest part of the job is the communte to downtown Dallas but management is somewhat flexible with your schedule.
good,A Security officer's life is rather boring and droll and we are paid like it to boot. Can't really give any pros or cons simply because it's just a means to an end. Management is nice and things can change at a moment's notice so flexibility is needed. Other than that Overtime is always welcomed since we're always short staffed. And the only way to make any real money is to work overtime because the wage they start you at is pretty lousy. Benefits are nice though.
good,The office is exactly what you would expect for a broker floor. A lot of competition between teams...not always for the CBRE brand. Older generation runs the decisions and very little influence by younger generation.
good,its a pleasure to work with a coworkers that feel like family like to earn trust from others with a customer obsession with ownership for the job thx!
good,"Great work environment, made some life long friendships. The workplace fostered learning, as a result I was able to develop several skills in many areas of office operations and marketing that I didn't have before working at CBRE, Inc."

good,"Busy environment with high demands on reaching the deadlines. "
good,"The days are very busy and can be stressful at times but overall, good atmosphere, work environment and fun people to be around."

good,"If your passion and dream is to work in corporate real estate, the best firm for you to work for is CBRE.  I was passionate about corporate real estate and wanted to make it my life's work and CBRE provided numerous opportunities for me to become a leader in the corporate real estate space.   CBRE is dedicated above everything else, to serving its corporate clients with distinction.   The culture is competitive and the people are first class.   CBRE allowed me to elevate my ambitions to the highest level and although this required sacrifice and commitment on my part, it also provided an opportunity for me to achieve goals BEYOND my wildest dreams.   After almost 10-years in corporate real estate, I decided that I wanted a change of pace in order to lead a healthy and more balanced life.   If you're ambitious and of high personal/professional character, find a way to join CBRE."
good,"good place to work but my expertise is not their core business, so no advancement potential. I have become a much better manager after 15 years at Monsanto."
good,Check building air condition also all other major equipment to make sure they are running normally. Responding to tenant request for service in and around the building .
good,A typical day at the office includes ensuring SLA agreement is meet daily. I learned how to motivate and encourage team members to give their best.

good,This is a very nice security position. Pays decent. Good for anyone needing a job and needs a secure job.
good,"Enjoyed working in this environment to support Property Management and Maintenance staff and clients.  Had a great rapport with team and tenants to whom we provided great service. Typical day was providing service to tenants regarding service contracts, vendor requests, reports, announcements,  and working with Technicians to provide excellent service to clients internally and externally .  The most enjoyable part of the job was making sure all service requests were met in a timely manner and also having  a great opportunity to learn more about the real estate business from a property management aspect while working in a professional work environment. "
good,"Work next to the Property managers in the banks, will do anything from eletrical, plumbing , HVAC, Carpentry , painting, ECT..."

good,constant moving
good,"All days are very Busy"
good,CBRE is a very good company.  Client had challenges with budgetary financial restrictions which resulted in risk to both client and CBRE. Tremendous commitment and work ethic with individual account team members.
good,"The people are willing to help you succeed in your job and are inclusive. It is a sink or swim kind of place and the work load is intense. Their computer system is not user friendly. If you're quick on your feet, you will survive."
good,CBRE as a whole is a great company. Very happy with them. But the management at my specific location is terrible. Looking to transfer to new location.
good,"Lack of communication, management was not clear or concise. Good pay and very nice benefits. When it comes to communicating with vendor or contractors the directions were vague."
good,CBRE is a great company to work for. They are a global company and you can move to different locations to help your family situation. The company is growing and moving in good directions.
good,"Great coworkers. "
good,"Sitting in a cubicle and staring at computer screens all day is not my idea of enjoyment. I have found growth and advancement difficult for many people The annual raises are not much to smile about. "
good,CBRE is a global real estate company that closely adheres to its RISE values.  Depending upon your role within the Company there are advancement opportunities.
good,Loved the firm and teams I worked with.  CBRE has extensive ability to implement technology and is working to offer a platform that maximizes productivity for property managers.
good,"* typical day at work depends is up to me what is really nice"
good,Hard to advance unless loyal to a fault and employed for over 5 years. Working culture in the office is good but requires a lot more work on management level.
good,"Typical day is emails, meetings and working on current project deliverables for the account.  I like the options to work with other teams within the company."
good,"CBRE is a good place to work. Benefits are not bad. Salary should be better for the size company there are. Work Life balance is not bad depending on the type of job you have, My job requires 24/7 365 needs. Others maybe 40 hour week and off nights and weekends."
good,"I worked as a tech on a larger campus. The work was steady but not too difficult."
good,"Like most places, the level of job satisfaction depends on the supervisor.  I've been fortunate to have three excellent supervisors.  And unfortunately one terrible one.  But the terrible one was managed out of a direct supervisory role pretty quickly.   Overall, a good place to work."
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
good,"My work is mostly client facing partnering with them to help improve their workplace experience. I've learned a great deal about commercial real estate, technology planning, business culture and implementing large scale programs. The management has allowed me great flexibility. Good overall culture. The hardest part of the job has been helping the client shift its own culture.  Helping the client achieve better performance."
good,"This company is less concerned with managing its assets than it is growing internationally. It is certainly large and has a lot of opportunities, but I feel as if more attention is paid to growing the company than managing current responsibilities."
good,"I enjoyed working with the people I dealt with on a regular basis. "
good,"While my tenure at CBRE began as the Edward S Gordon Company ( ESG ) which to this day people still talk fondly of, CBRE was and still is a top shelf organization.  Had i have the chance to do it all over again and know then what I know now, I would have never left the firm"
good,I liked working with the management at JCI and now CBRE but due to budget cuts and the possibility of our contract with GSK not being renewed I feel it is time to look else ware for employment.  This after working for JCI/CBRE for 15 years.  Not a choice I have not taken lightly.
good,"CBRE is an excellent company."
good,A limited contract experience.  The people were friendly and work environment professional.  Staff I worked with were great to get along with and helpful during onboarding.
good,"productive and very busy. Awesome team players within our dept but there is no room for growth at my location,  I would like to excel but management is not very helpful."
good,"I was very excited to be offered this position, however the training was limited as my direct supervisor was based in Boston and although I because proficient in Argus, it was mostly self-based."
good,"The most enjoyable parts of the job were the people and learning opportunities gained from working with a global, cross functional team.  CBRE is not a terrible place to work but it is a political, bureaucratic environment.  It's grown into a large global organization that has worked hard to move its back office systems and infrastructure to a structured platform.  If you have an existing strong knowledge-base to pull from it's an incredible environment to work in, but be prepared to work long and hard. Every manager is obviously different, but I happened to be in a situation where my manager was reactive to fires and didn't provide a lot of growth opportunities."
good,"It was good as certain essence of improving yourself day by day by mode of training was provided."
good,"I managed a group of project managers who provided facility services  for TD Bank corporate offices in the downtown core.  Provided weekly reporting and created a KPI structure to enhance service and manage time.  The culture was very service orientated and customer driven.  Managing a demanding client and keeping timelines within a set budget was challenging, however keeping people interested in repetitive functions was difficult.  Achieving our goals and KPIs all within budget to the satisfaction of our clients and CBRE."
good,"A great global company.  The company highly encouraged safety, thinking outside the box and likes when people bring ideas to the table, no matter how crazy they may sound."
good,"The company is a global real estate corporation but it is very difficult to move up without a BA/BS degree even if you have been with the company for awhile.  There is no up mobility in some departments and some managers are all for themselves and not their employees."
good,CBRE has a tradition of excellence. There a lots of resources and was a great jumping off point for me. It was a great learning experience and a great network to be apart of.
good,"Overall a good company to work for, long time employees are not paid as competitively as new hires.  This company has  wonderful employees and a great culture."
good,"I was a mobile technician for CBRE maintenance and contracted for 7 JC Penny stores. I would travel all over western N.Y. to each location inspecting repairing any electrical, plumbing and heating cooling. The people were great to work with and friendly. The hardest part of the job would be managing all 7 store locations due to the distance between each store. Time management is what I have learned to deal with being a part of the team."
good,"CBRE is a great place to grow and develop. There are tons of opportunities all over the world if you know what you want to pursue."
good,Awesome culture to work for! Training is world class! People and support are top notch! Lot's of room for advancement. Great benefits I should have never left!!
good,Generally good it depends on the account your working on. The account I am on seems to have struggles at the upper most management levels but middle management and Tech relationships are good pay is competative but not fantastic benefits are expensive but good.
good,"Funcionários muito profissionais, empresa extremamente organizada e com foco em seus objetivos."
good,"CBRE was my first venture into commercial real estate. I benefited from an experienced management team when I entered the business. The synergy between the different service lines was somewhat fractured, but I believe that was a regional problem and not representative of the company as a whole."
good,"Ótima empresa, com foco e objetivos claros para sempre atender com o melhor do mercado."
good,"I do 4 hours early evening which is very hard physical work and is checked and assessed weekly."
good,"Great Place to work awesome team. Very professional, Great HR practices. Good office environment. Weekends off provided you are a part of non sales. Overall its an awesome company."
good,IT is a pretty decent company to work with. It takes way longer than what promised to really advance in your career with this company. They give you health insurance since day one and also you start accumulating vacation time since day one.
good,"Welcomed clients while setting up meetings and catering for events.  Took care of staffs needs with IT, HR, and assignments.  There were many task to prioritize and plan.  I really enjoyed the colleagues that I worked with.  Beautiful new office Workplace360 Health & Wellness.  Sit-stand desk and ergonomic workstations."
good,"The people are amazing, some of the top in the field. The culture is competitive and fast-paced, but very collaborative. The benefits and pay are the best you'll find."
good,"hardest part of the job is managing such a high req load constantly"
good,"Work Culture is good"
good,Good work environment and encouraging management. They helped me develop my skills and increase my knowledge in accounting and property management field.
good,"- Entrepreneurial Corporate Culture"
good,CBRE has many different lines of business and working in shared services provides a glimpse into the various aspects of CBRE's business.  Working in shared services can be quite demanding but also rewarding when completing tasks that can benefit the entire US workforce.
good,CBRE is decent organization to work for and employees are the key to the success. Senior Management in Real Estate Division is only interested in profit on service contracts. Support at many levels is indifferent to resource needs and are not readily available to support

I work at a client site so my interaction with the local office is limited to my availability to visit, but I do try so that I can connect beyond my account.

Since I did not come from an university educated back round. I had to teach myself the tools of the job and learn the business as I went. Management was ok for me, my first line supervisor let me conduct myself however I needed to complete my task. If over site was needed, they would step in to help and direct me as needed. My co-workers were ok. Most were young kids right out of college and had no idea what good work rate was. My co-workers upset me quite a bit, due to, their idea of the job itself. They tried to innovate the business without understanding the business. It left a lot of extra work for me and some others. The kids out of college, just did not get it. The hardest part of my job was the travel to work everyday. One hour too work and almost two to three hours driving home. I had long days.

In Global Workplace Solutions, we work on client accounts, so it can feel isolating from the rest of the company because you are more immersed in the client's culture.  Also, if the client decides to downsize their account, you can be left looking for another job through no fault of your own.  If you have a good manager and work hard, there is tremendous opportunity for advancement and they will do more to help you find another role if your position is eliminated.  But, you have to own your own career as the culture is very entrepreneurial.  However, a bad manager can turn you into an order taker."
