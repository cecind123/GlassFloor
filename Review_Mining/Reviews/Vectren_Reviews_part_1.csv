bad,You will work for an awful micro managing boss. I would NOT work here and or work for the manager. They are very old school and behind the times with their systems and talent.
bad,Not flexible when children are ill.  Does not promote within.  Only allowed to be sick 4 times in a rolling 12 month period.  Benefits are great but the good insurance plans are being phased out.  Used to be a great company to work for but continues to go downhill.
bad,Watched a coworker get fired for something he had no part of. Worst management of any facility I have ever been at. Terrible place to work. Maintenance and production manager have no backbone and will not make a decision regarding ANYTHING
bad,What I learned at Vectren was not to ask questions. I entered during a stressful time and the manager was putting down the company. She was unsure of her job and was talking about strike constantly. When I asked a question she screamed in my face literally and kept wanting me to put my security answers in for my log in right in front of her. She didnâ€™t do that to anyone else. Not professional or welcoming!
bad,"From an IT Dept perspective...Lots of levels of management and lots of meetings where nothing gets done.  People brought in from the outside at a higher level than long time employees.  Since centerpoint has taken over things are bad.  If you are not from the centerpoint team you will be ignored, your knowledge and experience will be marginalized, and you will get the late shifts and menial tasks."
good,I took payments and  set up payment arrangements for members.  I found great satisfaction in helping members with there bills. I was allowed to reach out to upper authority to aid a member if needed
good,"Since the company is being sold, I would expect most all the Evansville jobs might be eliminated in a few years.  Though the merger may be a slow process."
good,"Learned coal pile operations, belt system maintenance, computer controlled belt system, power plant operations"
good,"Before the merger it was great, but ever since the merger things are starting to change and not for the good. We have supervisors leaving and long term employees leaving due to this."
good,"The hours are nice and there are options depending on which dept you work in.  No weekends unless you have a job that requires that as part of a utility, such as emergency calls (outage and dispatch.) The benefits are excellent, including the health insurance.  Now that the company is headquartered in Houston, TX, we no longer have instant, easy access to new job openings within the company and many positions were lost in the merger."
good,I would rather not comment with my opinion regarding this position. It was an extremely stressful work environment. I learned that this particular type of work environment did not suit me. The most enjoyable part of the job involved my co-workers.
good,"I had the best supervisor, who was the Operations Supervisor for the area. He had hired me previously for another area, when he was the Operations Supervisor there. He was great to work for. He wanted you to ""own"" the job, and I did. He was an exceptional manager. However, Vectren created a new job for an Operations Assistants supervisor, and everything changed. The new supervisor was a micro-manager and expected 100% loyalty overnight. That would have been fine, except she expected me to throw my old supervisor under the bus, which I would not do. All the good work I did was not acknowledged and any extra work I did was ignored by her. All overtime was canceled, which substantially increased my workload. This new supervisor was unbelievable. Her managers ignored any complaints about her, as she was of a different race working in a ""boy's club"" atmosphere. I was a contract employee, and she did  not extend my contract. I loved working there until she was promoted. And I am not the only person who did not like her, either. Vectren tends to hide their head in the sand when things get a little rough and they don't want to handle it, which is too bad. Overall, Vectren is a great place to work for and I wish I was still working there."
good,"this was a very challenging place for me as i was still new in the field of database administration. i learned here that to grow in this field of technology you have to keep learning new technology in order to keep up. overall, it was a wonderful experience"
good,"Good pay and benefits. Management is good depending on the department you get into. Culture is good depending on the area you get into. Work/life balance is good...depending on the area you get into. Overall a good place to work with great coworkers, decent management, good advancement/movement opportunities and good pay."
good,"I had fun at the job, my coworkers were great. Just the management and compensation could've been better. It was often mentioned by my peers that I was the lowest paid member of our department. Our management in their defense, was dealing with the Center Point integration and the Windows 10 project at the same time. Manpower for managing things was strung out very thing so often times we ran into issues that couldn't be fixed immediately."
good,A professional corporate environment with many options for employees. Nice benefits and employee programs. Interesting work and great people who work for the company.
good,For a union/company environment it was actually a nice place to work. Management was great to work for and you felt secure in your positions even in the ever changing coal market.
good,"I start my workday at 7:00 am. I begin by reviewing the progress made from the previous day. From there I perform any analysis that needs to be done and compare it to my prior findings. Once I have made good progress I collaborate with fellow colleagues and management on what has been done and where we need to go. I have learned to effectively communicate through personnel interactions as well as technical reports. I have improved my abilities in Microsoft Excel and analytical problem solving skills. I listen and learn from more experienced professionals and do what management asks of me in a timely and efficient manner. My co-workers are friendly, helpful, and considerate. The hardest part of my job is performing in depth analyses on different fields with very limited data. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the people and the varying challenges from day to day."
good,"Vectren is a great place to work, their community involvement is a highlight of the places I enjoy working. They can be difficult to navigate because many people wear many hats and tend to have silos.  Advancement is dependent on the manager so have not been promoted in 10+ plus while others in other departments are promoted annually. There are few town hall meetings to hear from the CEO or CIO the direction the company is headed."
good,we were given an assignment to work a project and my team members and i were able to complete the  project on time even we had to some difficulties during its configuration.
good,It's a great job I really like it has great benefits and great pay. Great for family oriented people. Possiblity of advancement and vacation pay is great
