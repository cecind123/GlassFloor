rating,review
bad,This company does not provide the necessary resources to do the job. Expects management people to work 14 hour days 6 days a week. Does not care about quality or meeting Codes. Horrible experience working for them.
bad,Human resources is unprofessional. There is no follow-up or follow through. Phone call after phone call human resource agents provide little if any relevant information.
bad,"They promise you so much, it’s all Lies the San Antonio division is the worse division because of management. You have a 2 month training class with joke of a trainer! You are $6000 in the draw before you hit the floor, and they would do anything to make sure you don’t get out of the draw, you pay 25% of your commission to a performance coach that doesn’t do a darn thing but just take your money! Stay away!!!!"
bad,"This place is one of the worst builders to work for in the SA market. They can’t keep sales staff and during one period lost 20 sales reps in 71 days. Lowest commissions out of any builder, ANY BUILDER. over 65% cancel rate and their ethics will have you questioning whether management has any moral code. They move you in an out of communities based on favoritisms and regardless of performance. Beware of the recruiting tactics and they have job fair EVERY MONTH cause they can’t keep people. STAY AWAY !!!"
bad,Training and expectations not clear or realistic. People with a lack of construction knowledge in positions that influence daily operations. Department silos and gotcha culture. Sales and Construction at odds with internal and external customers. Good Surveys with home owners are bought.
bad,"More concerned with political correctness than anything else.  Big plans, big projects, cheerleading shows.... nothing materializes.  Absolutely zero is accomplished 9-5 BUT everyone likes to put on a show and work from home with 9pm 11pm 2am conference calls being common."
bad,"Got fired as soon as they found out I was pregnant. Later said I was slacking off, I was only a month pregnant. Never slacked off! Engineer I worked for said it was risky if I should ever trip in the future with my belly getting bigger."
bad,Upper management has no idea of what it takes to build a good home. This company offers the lowest amount in pay. bonuses are paid once a year at the lowest amount.Not a good work environment.
bad,"They eat you up and spit you out.  Yelling, screaming and poor compensation are just daily life at Lennar.  I would not go back there to work for my previous manager."
bad,"Go to office pick up work orders for the day , drive to Edison check on bldgs under construction, call trades and or homeowners to schedule repairs. drive to township pick up CO'S"
bad,"For being such a big company and they strive on the fact that they are family oriented and treat everyone Ina first name basis. This actually Ito true they have no care for you as an employee. Managers micromanage and there is no communication at all. Talk about lack of communication with the corporate structure.   Divisions don't communicate let alone within departments.  Benefits are ok and the vacation, sick, personal days are a joke.   If they could have you work more than 40 hrs they would.  Company is just mediocre"
bad,"Garbage company, no direction, does not reward employees, never gives raises, no upward mobility, extremely demanding."
bad,Poor company to work for for a college graduate.  Long hours and little pay for the reward of building someones home.  Mnagement was more concerned with making bonuses than the employees.
bad,"I worked for Lennar in Portland and have to tell you this was the worst experience I have had to date in a sales position. You are treated like a second class citizen as the construction department in this division has ALL of the power and clout. They are not building homes as they say ""to industry standards"" and there is nothing you as a sales person are going to do to change this. "
bad,This company is not LGBTQ friendly and a bad place to work.  I was forced to come out at work and then shorty after I was fired for being gay.  HR is a joke and everyone takes care of themselves and could care less about others.  They will make you work like a dog and they don’t care.  They are all about money and profit.
bad,"I was told to be frank in answering questions, that the interview was confidential. They in-fact,  slipped up and I was told they shared it with the POR HR Manager. This caused my leaving to be very awkward. The HR Manager wanted me to back date my 2 week notice so they would not have to pay the final true amount.  My pay was pulled then 30 days received."
bad,"I relocated for this job, busted my hump, and was extremely professional.  My supervisor hampered me and valued the opinion of trade partners who would clamor for more money to complete tasks they were supposed to complete the first time.  They tell you that you cannot self perform, hammer you over trade partner lack of response, get you in a position where they hold you accountable for dates, then fire you when you self perform.  They tell you where you can and cannot do business due to corporate sponsorships and, when you have no choice but to visit a prohibited business, hold you accountable.  My experience was much like the conservative Christian strategy for conquering the nation.  The most enjoyable part of the job is building a structure that, hopefully, will provide shelter for a happy family.  That is the only perk."
bad,"Lennar's big keyword is Family. but they don't treat employees personal. Traditionalism creates distance between a company that ""Family"" doesn't fit. they failed!"
bad,"Management only cares about number of homes sold."
bad,Your best will never be enough for this company. No matter how fast or how good you do it they will want more.  They don't hire the best contractors or supply you with the best products to build with yet expect a 10/10  product at the end.
bad,"Direct supervisors are not the issue.  Division president doesn't care about employees.  We feel replaceable and underappreciated.  Some staff members are hostile because they are overworked or pitted against one another.  Bonuses and commissions are based on overall customer service scores and not individual scores, therefore entire teams are losing valuable and hard earned income due to departments they have no control over.  Their families suffer because of the under performance of others.  Construction managers and customer care managers can lose bonuses because of a bad experience with our under-performing lender affiliate or other affiliates.  This is very demotivating and is creating anxiety and hostility.  Morale is low and people are leaving.  Very sad."
bad,"Lennar is great company , unfortunately since its based on getting paid on closed deals which can take 6 o 8 months, the management is exploiting this and hiring new hired everyday and firing new hires everyday , since if you get fired you don't get paid so company uses reps to sell before closing homes will find anything small reason to fire employees and saves hunders thousands of dollars , lennar home si a scam"
bad,"While working for Lennar I've never experienced a more rude, disrespectful group of people. They work you from sun up to sun down everyday. You can't even take lunch away from the job site. You deal with rude upper management that threaten you everyday that you are going to lose you job for not having things completed. You ask for help and they tell you that if they're going to help you they may as well do it themselves. Very rude and disrespectful place to work."
bad,"Run, don’t walk, run for the door. Vice President of construction says one thing then does another, making his Superintendents look like complete fools to the subcontractor base."
bad,Heavily based on cliquish behavior and gossip. Managers are just figureheads set up to do upper managements dirty work. Upper management are disconnected from reality and cover for the less competent in upper management. Coworkers are mind numbingly dumb while other senior staff manipulates them by spreading gossip. Don't even think about voicing concerns because HR will quickly show you the door. Steer clear of this place.
bad,"Management is from the good 'ol boys club. You don't have to be a good manager, just a family friend. Old Antiquated process cause projects to continue indefinitely. Poor management causes major systems to be upgraded at the same time causing multiple conflicts and down-time."
bad,In Maryland the VP of construction was just ridiculous to work for bipolar maybe or just unable to comprehend basic information. He and his team would direct the subcontractors without your knowledge and ask why isn’t the work getting done.
bad,"The worst, most high pressure operation one could imagine.  If you don't care about yourself and your client, you can make big money.  "
bad,I worked there for a year until I left for another builder. Managment is the worse . The VP of sales is a pervert and the Division president is a clueless clown with no ethics . They pay the lowest commission out of every builder and expect you to work 7 days a week. Any good review is fake and done by there lazy marketing team. Beware ! There is a reason the turnover is so high. Stay away !!
bad,"Very, very few employees are given opportunity to growth professionally; leadership team at the top is very narrow minded, ""bottom line"" is the norm; lots of employee turnover!"
bad,You can never over produce. it is always expected to over achieve. The amount of hours to do your job effectively is too much. The job interferes with your work/life balance.
bad,"Weak leadership. No accountability.  And you get thrown under the buss for your co-workers lack of planning and poor execution.  Lots of freedom and good work life balance.  However, lots of drama and no support"
bad,"The Division President of the IE division publicly humiliated me in a meeting because i was 10 minutes late due to a road closure, something i could not control. I am not normally late. When people are late to a meeting he makes them sing in front of everyone."
bad,"fast pace, not family friendly, if you choose to work at Lennar PLEASE keep to yourself cause other construction managers will throw you under the bus"
bad,"The Director of Construction is a selfish, manipulative and constantly setting team members for failure"
bad,The person s in charge don’t care about the employees most construction manager s last about two years do to working conditions. The concept is great but the way they do it is horrible
bad,Production building is a constant push to go faster and faster. Quality is low. Don't expect a raise at yrs end and expect the carrot to be pushed out at every milestone achieved.
bad,I left the company after Fathers Day due to a disagreement that was made to me by management.  This is the only company I have ever worked for where I mostly have negative things to say.  So I would rather not say them.
bad,"I was very disappointed with the locations they put me. They had no regard to my distance from home or my safety. Management would not work with me in anyway, even though I made a many difficult sales. They did not meet my expectations and put me to sell in a community that I knew from the very begging was going to be very hard to sell in. I was unhappy the whole time I worked there."
bad,Horrible place to work!   Lot of misleading information was given in the Raleigh office.   There seemed to be a lot of turn over during my time there.
bad,High pace work environment with the lack of immediate manager involvement. Inconsistency on directions or process from upper management.  Constant learning of new programs and processes
bad,"First, let it be known that I have built for numerous other builders, so I can make a fair and accurate comparison. Unfortunately this job became a joke. The management was overbearing, would not let anyone do their jobs. Hours ranged anywhere from 50 to 80 hours per week, family wasn't even a thought as you would be required to work every Saturday, could get called in on a Sunday and holidays? Forget it! The management of the north east division is a collective group of morons. The quality of the construction is horrible! Homes selling for 700K to 1.3M have the quality of a garden shed, nothing to be proud of. If you get the opportunity to work for Lennar in the Northeast, RUN, it will not be a good mark on your resume!"
bad,"When frst working for U.S.Home - Lennar in 2005 I found the perfect job. I  went from customer care rep to assistant project manager to running my own Community. Once the community was completed in 2011, I was moved to an active adult community. than I was rail roaded from  the area manager in charge. jan 14 they made the biggest mistake by letting go of the best Director I ever had to someone that had no business taking the postion.worst thing Lennar ever did. Their was nothing really hard about the job, just need to follow up and watch your back."
bad,"Not the best company I have worked for. Reached out for help many times regarding the team member I was forced to work with. She was awful and conniving and the Director knew her antics and never reprimanded or talked to about her work ethic. We have 4 directors in a span of 2 years. The best part of working for the company was the Vendor I coordinated with for appointments.  Management was foolish with hiring and poor decision making. I decided to leave based on poor management,  poor counterpart team work & lack of promotion/recognition. I would have stayed if Management would have done their job."
bad,Lennar is a very well-run organization-just don't expect any warm and fuzzies while you are there. The culture is cold at best and there is an almost blind insistence on following regional directives at the cost of ignoring local circumstances. People are not encouraged to think outside the box.
bad,"Lennar is an appealing place to work.  However, low pay and high stress with out life work balance leads to total burn out."
bad,It is a massive company that require employees to complete deadlines under a lot of pressure and the culture will not help by letting managers put down employees
bad,This job is really based on who you know at Lennar. The people that make money here are the ones that are friends with the management. There are new home consultants making over $200k (maybe 5) and most of them are making $45k. It’s all politics here. However I will say everybody is nice as far as management goes. Unfortunately the management isn’t supported like they should be so they do their best. My overall experience was it was a waste of time. If Lennar made it to where everybody made money then the turn over wouldn’t be so bad. Lennar really doesn’t care if you make money or not. They are only concerned with hitting their numbers.
bad,"Lennar SA is a company that requires long work hours, working on your off days, and staying until the contract is written. This being said, it is very hard to maintain a work-life balance. No consideration is given for families or kids. If you're sick, take an aspirin and get to work."
bad,"Keeping all Trade Partners Insurance & Contracts up to date."
bad,"Market fell out. 8 years and no pay increase. Many Division Mangers, high turn over rate of employees. Not enough employee's to cover the State of VA."
bad,"12 hour days, 6 days a week, although I have learned alot concerning the front end of the business.  Open door policy, however frowns down upon you standing up for yourself."
bad,Decent company with high expectations from the employee. The work life balance is a bit rough as you work full speed during a normal day. Good if you are a young person with lots of energy.
bad,This company works you to death. Has weird cult like procedures. You have to recite a poem in front of your peers and that is part of your employment there.
bad,If you want to work at a place where there is no planning or direction from leadership on multiple teams this is the place for you.  The communication is in Silos.  The correct resources aren't brought in until the problem has become too big to handle.  It's best not to have any contrary opinion whether you are the subject matter expert or not.  Unqualified directors maintain their positions no matter how inept they are or how many unsuccessful projects they have owned.  If you want to feel like you are in a high school clique again this is the place for you.
bad,"Old school thinking placed into a new box and new words to describe it, but fails to truly meet the mark. People rotate in and out of the field positions because the company expects them to make gold out of straw."
bad,"Management only cares about numbers. Jobs are threatened constantly when not meeting goals. Sales manager is rude, condescending and unprofessional. First day on the job was asking where to get botox in the area."
bad,"high stress environment, exercise amount of hours if you are a salaried employee, bonus promise never delivered, no life. management team comprise of good old boy click."
bad,"For a large builder these folks do not have their act together.  Same problems as any other builder.  Sales in their own world, purchasing behind on setting budgets, change orders frowned upon, inaccurate take offs,  senior managers too busy or unwilling to share information or better business practices.  Unfortunately the buyers pay the brunt of all the issues with items missed promised by sales, poor workmanship, homes finished late and incomplete.  Heavy handed approach by management and sales.  Through it all they are able to find time to pat themselves on the back at how great they are.  You be the judge."
bad,"I was given an opportunity at Lennar and I ran with it.  I met a lot of amazing people and did some really great work there.  Over time, I realized that I had to go.  It just was not turning out to be the place for me.  When things turn sour, they sour fast."
bad,Working for Lennar was a opportunity that opened the door for me into construction. It broadened my view and opened my eyes to understanding more about construction and how the field operates. I was glad I had the opportunity to work there.
bad,"Please consider a position with this company if and only if you have no life and do not mind working crazy hours, getting calls and emails after business hours / weekends, with your reply expected as a norm within the job culture."
bad,"Construction Management in a production company is alot different than that of custom building.  I have done both.  As far as Lennar goes they depend heavily on what the homeowner thinks in response to surveys.  "
bad,"No support from management.  Awesome office staff. As the Division Safety Manager for more than 30 construction sites, lots of driving to each site was required sometimes weekly. Management will not support your decisions or recommendation for environmental and safety compliance."
bad,"Was a nice place to work at first with upper management support, but then things started to change and there wasn't as much support from upper management as before."
bad,"Company values are overall good.  Seems most divisions are team oriented.  "
bad,"Company went on a hiring frenzy, only having to lay off local (CA) associates whose positions were either moved to east coast office or outsourced over-seas."
bad,"schedule was 9-5 mostly working at a desk, purchasing meetings every Monday. Management needs work.  I felt great working for this company until there was an integration of another company and things started to go down hill."
good,"Middle management is run very poorly - lack of communication and no understanding of what your job actually requires. Unrealistic demands are put on us to perform, when management (other than my direct boss) doesn't know a thing about our job."
good,"High turnover, horrible benefits if you’re pregnant or expecting. Not much flexibility in hours, very stressful place to work depending on the department. Ridiculous dress code."
good,"Income can adjust rapidly up or down, Your work schedule is 24/7/ daily. There isn't a work culture. This is a job to go in make your money and get out!"
good,"Lennar was a great company to work for, but management is stagnant and doesn't apply themselves to troubled homeowners. Got to meet a lot of people from different cultures. They taught you the basics of home building."
good,"I can not comment further at this time. If you put your heart into your work and work hard it can be rewarding. There are a lot of goals to achieve on a regular basis, good benefits."
good,"Great place to start building a career in new home sales - the training program is excellent "
good,"Decent culture, long hours.Some smart people work there, but seems to be turnover from the rigors of the industry. As with any public company they need yo until they don't or you performance waivers any."
good,Bad compnay but they closed all their branches during the crash.  Didnt offer much advancement.  They are heavy on the micro managment.
good,High volume with aggressive deadlines. As long as you’re willing to work 60 plus hours a week and follow every procedure to the point you can do well with this company.
good,"After the downturn everyone ended up responsible for 10 things, and as the economy has turned around the responsibilities seem to be going back to a more normal level."
good,The training they provide is good when you start  you fully get to understand the ins and out of building a home!  you need to the work in also if you was to be successful in this line of work
good,"Good people but not a lot of communication from management.  Little to zero room for advancement in IT.  Risks are not often rewarded, and there doesn't seem to be a lot of sense of direction."
good,Benefits are good management looks out for themselves and not there employees work environment can be toxic a lot of temp employees with a lot of turn over no proper training
good,A never ending cycle of unresolved issues with no support from management and blame placement is always accompanied. A bad day is noticed more than a good day and management shows its true colors on a daily basis.
good,"Friendly environment in some cases, They allow you us to learn and be creative. My current supervisor support me very well. "
good,"Challenging work, busy office, constant change and learning - too much work for an 8 hour day.  No time to problem solve issues. Management does not always support you- often need to watch your back and cover your self in documentation"
good,"Lennar purchased the company I was working for, CalAtlantic Homes. The management from Lennar had the mindset of us and them. Most of the sales associates that from CalAtlantic have left Lennar because of this mindset."
good,The Culture was pretty good. Fun team and experience. The company have decent benefits for the number 1 home builder in America. Decent company to work at - just ry to be on the right team with a positive manager.
good,All about numbers. Worry about quality after they close. Trades pushed fast and not paid well. Quality suffers and they we are supposed to ask for 10s on survey
good,"You spend more time on the computer or iPad than building houses because the information in the scheduling program is missing or wrong. It’s being worked on and in the right direction, but not there yet."
good,"Company has a lot of work to do. You work all the time. The work grows more and more each day. You do not get any type of work life balance, esp if you are a working mom- stay away"
good,This company is more concerned with profit than they are providing a great service. They do not make the employees feel appreciated.  Instead they continuously remind you that you are replaceable.
good,"Lennar is a publicly traded corporation. Therefore, their interest is profits, not employees. There is little balance between home and work life. When the recession hit, they laid off employees en mass with little to no notification. Sub contractors were not paid what their contract said, and Lennar offered them pennies on the dollar what they were owed, causing many to go out of business."
good,I really enjoyed this job. It was what I had always wanted in a job. Unfortunately it did not last very long due to the economy in 2008.
good,A solid company with the ability to grow as required by the market.
good,Cut and Dry position. Nothing outstanding. Everyone focused on self.
good,"A Lennar production manager is spread thin and worked hard.  Your superiors are also stretched too thin and even if they want to help aren’t able to do more then give a few minutes to guide you towards some resolution of your needs."
good,This is overall a decent place to work.  In a big company it is hard not to feel like a number.  The company seems to be losing a sense of unity.  It is being run more like a machine.
good,It is fine working at this place. Flexibility. challenging tasks within the technical team and initiating and solutions are open. but lot of politics happen.
good,It’s a good place to work if Management could get out of their own way. Need to have land ready before homes start being built. And there are too many homes being built at once which hurts over all quality.
good,The work is generally fast paced and quick responses are necessary. It is generally a thankless job and requires lots of patients and people skills. You must also have a very high tolerance for intaking complaints.
good,"•	Relaxed and productive atmosphere. ..."
good,"Lovely coworkers at this company. They are friendly, helpful, and encouraging. knowledgeable about their areas of expertise and how their duties correspond to the duties prior to reaching their desk and the tasks required after work leaves their desks."
good,"Great builder and you can learn A TON. Very good at what they do and offer great training. Work/life balance is tough here though and it really is Lennar's way or the highway. Had a great time working here, made a great income and learned a huge amount, just decided to get out of the corporate mayhem."
good,"workplace is great, just that a few of the manger spoil the culture, values, mission of the company. "
good,"Signed in and out  each day in the Manager of A/P's office."
good,"Its a fast pace environment, A lot of great people all wanting to climb. Like any place it all really depends on the VP you work for. If you can lay low for a few years you might get somewhere worth while. However if you want to climb fast. Might not be the right fit for you."
good,"Quick paced"
good,"A typical day was coordinating trades, inspections, scheduling, communicating with home buyers, creating PO's, ordering materials."
good,"A typical day at Lennar was fairly boring and stressful, i learned a lot about accounting, management could improve, workplace culture was very stuffy, the hardest part of my job was waiting for recognition for my work, there wasn't much enjoyable about this job."
good,Working for this employer improved my skills as a general ledger accountant working in a fast paced environment with a heavy focus on customer service.
good,"Fast-paced environment and competitive industry. "
good,Not too flexible with breaks if you have one. The work place is swamp with papers and wires to do. They expect you to stay over time.
good,"I am currently working in the Marketing department of Lennar Homes. A top nationwide homebuilder. I am responsible for preparing and providing the numerous requirements to open a new home  community."
good,Good Sales Training. Lennar builds a competitive product and uses a different marketing approach as to how they sell their homes.
good,Competitive sales floor and company cut benefits.  Management supportive on the local level.
good,"Continually marketing to real estate agents, following up with previous leads, managing active contracts and ensuring adequate marketing suplies at all times.  The is a fast paced industry with minimal corporate direction, however is very results driven.  Everyday is fulfilling and different than the next."
good,Was there less then a year. They promised to send me to training but never did. ; (
good,One of the best overall company cultures I've been a part of and embraced.  Great training and on boarding programs.  Too much corporate intervention did not allow us to do what the market needed for us to be successful
good,"I enjoyed working with the managers and coworkers at Lennar. "
good,"busy office, 50% of job was administrative functions and 50% was interactions with county and local jurisdictions to procure permits, most enjoyable part of the job was building relationships with county/government officials to procure permits, interactions with architects and engineers"
good,"the work day starts at 6:30 am to 5pm . what I learned is to manage unskilled trades in production home building, and to mange a 95 day home building cycle. Management was good and bad the good they truly cared about you as a person, management didn't really know the building process. the hardest part of the job was to assure the trades were building correctly. the most enjoyable part of the job is to watch a new homebuyer take ownership of a home you just built for them that they appreciated. Lennar in all is a good company it fast paced environment is not for everyone"
good,Lennar was a great company to work for until it went under. Layoffs happened quickly and they did everything they could for the process to not be painful.
good,"my immediate supervisor, though very knowledable in all aspects of the business. was very long winded and did not seem too see the urgency of the situation. the v.p. on the otherhand was very decisive and i worked with him after the corporate layoff too finally finish up the project l.o.c's and hoa turnovers. hardest part was getting approvals through corp. when critical issues had too be addressed."
good,"They give you lots of work, and all of it is priority at the same time.  I loved the busyness, the work and the software.  The downside is, I pushed myself so hard to get my tasks done that I skipped lunches, breaks, and commuted a long way both ways to get to this job for a long time. Relocation wasn't going to be as easy as I had thought.  It was too much.  I got very sick.  I couldn't continue the pace.  I physically had to stop the pace, or I was going to end up in the graveyard."
good,"Effectively communicates expectations, Shares ideas and techniques, Is continuously experimenting to drive sales, Is very innovative under adverse conditions, Promotes a learning culture"
good,"I worked in Lennar for 4 years, I had very good experience with my co-workers, they are all friendly, they all support and collaborate in difficult situations or when there is a project to solve. The days go by regularly there is a lot of work, activities or new projects. The company has good benefits and varied activities during the year for employees."
good,They promote ITIL but its not it use. Whoever yells the loudest will get their work done first.It seems as if support is always lagging for the end users here.
good,The company is the largest home builder in the USA but lacks to take care of those that work hard for them to continue being successful in their result driven company.  Not very happy with having to ask for a pay raise and not even given any type of answer back.  Upper management is to busy trying to make themselves look good and forget that the construction manager and assistant manager make everything happen.
good,"I was there during the housing market downturn so there were several restructures which I managed to survive, but meant I was moved around a lot. The office staff I worked with was friendly."
good,I enjoyed this company the employees were really great to work for and the benefits were really good
good,"I loved working at Lennar. It was a great balance of work and fun. Once a month we'd have a end of the day ""stress ball fight"". We had a ""Biggest Looser Weight loss"" contest to motivate employees that wanted to get in better shape. We sponsored Base Camp. "
good,"During my time at Lennar, I enjoyed nearly every moment with every person. Learning new things on an almost daily basis. "
good,"This was a contract position that lasted 3 months in which I worked at least 40 hours a week and traveled around 200 miles every Friday.  My boss was located in another state and gave very little feedback.  The division I was in charge of was in disarray when I arrived and required me to work from scratch to get my work bench even usable to work on PC's. By the time I had gotten everything organized and in working order my contract was over.  I was liked by all of the staff and everyone whom I worked with said I did better than the guy before me.  The most enjoyable part of my work day was working with my co-workers.  They were all nice and understanding.  I learned how to manage and run an IT department and what not to do.  The most frustrating thing was that for an hour a day I had to assist the company help desk.  I had so much on site work that I couldn't afford to spend the time doing two roles.  The company didn't' want to hire more people on their help desk and wanted to leverage their contract employees to help them, they did not have their full time employees help with this what so ever. I upgraded all the machines when I arrived as well as helped them upgrade their copiers to make things more efficient.  I also had them put in the proper BBU's in their server room in order to prevent power issues, which one occurred while I was working there."
good,"There is a shift on leadership direction pretty much every month. There is always a lack of project / program portfolio indicating priorities, that causes low focus on goals."
good,"Work days were long, but satisfying with lots of sales opportunities the first year.  "
good,"Lennar is currently the largest new home builder in the US.   It is a great company where the money to be made can be endless, especially in Texas for obvious economic reasons, however the hours necessary to meet goals were too endless.  It's a great company to work for if you don't need weekends off and work/life balance is not a priority."
good,"Lennar is a corporation like any other. It has it's good side and it has it's office politics and games. I've been with the company for 6 years and I've seen the good, the bad, and the ugly."
good,Workplace is good. Not great for IT as it doesnt use any cutting edge technology. But friendly and good atmosphere. Doenst have much opportunity for growth.
good,Day to day includes very mundane tasks. I am considered a temp and am reminded constantly that I am just that. No direction given toward whether I will become perm or not.
good,"Building houses is a high pace environment.   Many builders did not make it due to the pace.  Being highly organized is key.  Lower base salary, however, the bonus they paid on completed homes made up for it."
good,"As a production home builder Lennar knows how to pump out houses. The staff are professional, friendly and generally supportive. Lacking staff the Director of Purchasing often wears several hats, works long hours and on weekends (frequently the first one in the building and the last one to leave). Lennar has several layers of management and the Director of Purchasing may work for a VP rather than the Division President. Senior Management is prone to micro managing, which can be tough for somebody who is a strong leader. Lots of forms and paperwork  to fill out. Division offices do not actually enter cost or data information into the JD Edwards software. Instead information is entered into forms and spreadsheets and sent to a regional operations center who then enters the data."
good,The day was always busy and it covered a wide variety of activities.  Worked with the customer care reps on warrantee repairs and issues from 18 different developments.  Handled the organization of the homeowners files and worked with the escrow group on all closings so the files were current.  Enjoyed working with the different departments and seeing the teams work together.
good,"I worked for Lennar two different times ... the first time was amazing !! Great supervisors and management team ... great pay, benefits and bonuses !! Absolutely loved my job ... got the back up when needed, tools to do my job proficiently and was rewarded for doing a job well done !!! On my second go around, everything had changed !!!! They wanted my starting salary to be the same amount it had been eight years prior, with the same job title !! Had to fight and negotiate for two dollars more an hour, no back up, management  was extremely disappointing as was the bonuses .... very disappointed with the direction my local branch had gone in !! I'm sure not all branches are the same, and the company as a whole is a good place to work !!"
good,I was given the opportunity to learn about the building industry.  I worked directly for the Division VP and Operations Manager as their administrative support and company Event Coordinator.
good,Lennar is a great US based company with a strong internal culture. After more than 10 years I can still recite Dr. Seuss books and the little red hen.
good,excellent place to work very fair and great pay if the bottom did not fall out of the housing and mortgage market most of us would still be there sadly
good,Very stressful and sub contractors lacking motivation to complete their work in a timely fashion creating extra workload for Superintendents and creating anxiety for homeowners
good,Too many systems; dont connect with each other. Poor communication.Lots of confusion; no one knows where to find people; no directory IT help desk was awesome.
good,Salarly was above normal.  Management was always helpful if you had a problem.  Employee and Family gatherings.   Employees gathering once a month.  Continuing Education was applauded.
good,"Ever since the crash back in 2008 and the housing market was hit so hard, they have really changed.  Not for the better either.  It would be great to join them again, but I have spoken with several employees who are still there and they are VERY unhappy but employed."
good,"Every day I would put out inspection packets and walk my homes every morning and evening. I learned how to build a home, in all stages. The most enjoyable part of this job was closing homes."
good,"Newly hired employee still feeling the place out, but was told that lots of room for growth should be available with time."
good,"It was a very good company to work for and had a lot of good people there too. Okay, so when the economy started falling, they were letting people go, last hired, first to go and they gave everyone lame excuses for letting you go. There were females in the office who spent way too much time standing around each others desks gossiping. I just ignored them and did my work and they literally tried everything in the book to get me out of there. I even had one of the girls literally trip me right in front of one of the bosses. Otherwise, I really loved my job and most of the people I worked with there."
good,"•	Provide clerical and administrative support to National Purchasing Team"
good,"I enjoyed my desk with various problems to tackle and resolve on a daily basis.  A Busy department, that can get stressful with payroll deadlines. The hardest part was dealing with my managers' micro-managing."
good,"Lennar homes incorporated sales and fun into their work environment to help all feel as though they were part of the family."
good,"Working on site sales has evolved since 1998.  Before I relocated back to SW Florida in Jan. 2013, I worked 2 years with Lennar Homes.  It was exciting to be back in my element selling new homes!  The long commute to numerous locations, changing locations randomly and the openings of new take down communities was the hardest part. I worked at Pulte Homes 10 years and stayed at a community for several years farming that neighborhood. I also opened new communities with preparations planned in advance with a following ready to purchase at the opening. A typical day at work was to reach out to all contacts from networking, realtors from past events, family, friends and follow up on walk ins. My experience working in general real estate at Stirling Sotheby's and Keller Williams helped me bring my contacts on site to purchase. I am used to working as a team and I also work well independently which brings a good mix to all types of sales.  I enjoy people and appreciate diversity which gives me the enthusiasm to either lead or follow.             "
good,In my line of work I stay busy helping out the new home consultants with their day to day routine. I look over communities while the new home consultants are off and I try to sell houses.
good,"Good place to work overall. Walk homes, make punch list call contractors, call in inspections, follow all building codes."
good,I have enjoyed learning everyday at Lennar and having been given the opportunity to be able to learn on the job training or learn as I go as certain situations arise
good,"High stress managing village requirements, company schedules and standards, and home owner's expectations with a decling labor pool in both quanity and quality."
good,People and work are great.  Work/Life Balance from time to time can be frustrating but fair. Great team collaboration.  The team works through issues together.
good,"Got to work at sales center at each community, so like being at home. Most home shoppers are friendly, some agents aren't. Got to learn a lot about the real estate and home building industries."
good,"Working there was good, when issues accrued and looked to manager, you got no help they they blame you for not doing your job, Or when things finally escalate to corporate then they get on your case and get involved. "
good,I’ve worked for several builders and Lennar has been much better than Century Communities and True Homes. Working for Lennar isn’t too bad but try to keep from taking on too many houses. They will load you up and expect you to still be successful if you don’t speak up. Don’t think by taking on more and looking like you can do or handle more will get you anywhere. It will get you noticed but for the wrong reasons.
good,As a contractor I had to leave the company when CalAtlantic was acquired by Lennar and the entire AP department dissolved even though I liked to work under their past paced  and upbeat environment.
good,"Lennar has a large UC environment and provides plenty of opportunity to learn and grow within the company. With an excellent and diverse IT department, it is a great atmosphere."
good,"The sale of the local builder business to Lennar change my opinion of company, but overall great product and pricing for the market."
good,"Lennar is considered pretty advanced in the building industry. They were the first to issue ipads and iphones to the field and were advanced partners in the buildpro app. Their processes in this regard are great. They don't pay as well as some of their competition, to my knowledge and the company is very different from city to city. I worked in Houston and in Dallas and they were very different in terms of atmosphere and procedures. A great place to start a career as a builder."
good,"Good people building a good product.  The company has its struggles due to the economic downturn over the past several years effecting the housing industry.  However, if you're looking to work for a home builder, this is a place to consider."
good,"Being the REM, I had the opportunity to visit many sites and work with a variety of people from top to bottom."
good,"The building id=s brand new and had all of the amenities you would like. Free coffee, ping pong, shuffleboard, contests many things to keep you involved."
good,"Good company. You get what you put into it.  Sales people in SWFL make anywhere from $50K to $350,000."
good,I liked working at Lennar. Most of the employees were  friendly and helpfull. I really enjoyed the extra activities they do for the community. I would recommend them to anybody.
good,This company came into the Greenville SC market after purchasing another company.  They left after a few years as the economy turned.  They were loyal to long term employees.
good,"It's alright.Could be better. Work is work. What more can one say. The turnover is higher than the retention rate. No point in staying for a 3 % match on pension, when they make up for it by screwing you over on pay."
good,"Overall, this was an interesting job in a new community. The staff was pleasant and there was a lot of interaction with the homeowners. Would have stayed if that were possible."
good,"It is a nice place to work. A family oriented company, the associates are very friendly and helpful. I would recommend working for Lennar if you can handle the stress properly"
good,A typical day at work requires high interaction with internal and external parties. What I love most is to interact with people and be able to assist others.
good,"Positive work environment.  Pleasant place to work. Upper management was cordial to all, no matter what position the employee held.  Not stuffy at all.  Lots of activities to boost morale (free lunches, ice cream sundae socials).  Great place to work until the 'bubble burst and the housing market tanked'...then 75% of us lost our jobs."
good,"Lennar is the number one home builder in Central Florida, as such they have many inventory homes available for sale.  My job involved driving between projects to cross-sell their products.  I had to pre-qualify customers and write purchase agreements.  After a contract was written, my job was just getting started!  Follow up between the client and lender was a daily job and involved moving people around until a final approval was reached.  Other job functions involved attending weekly meetings, creating competitive shop reports, maintaining the communities and holding Realtor functions."
good,I absolutely loved working for this company until the housing market crashed.
good,If the market did not crash I would still be working for Lennar.
good,"Lennar Homes is a parent company of home builders and mortgage offices with 8,000+ employees. As a PC Technician I helped take care of 400+ associates in the Lennar corporate office including executives and log their issues into our HEAT ticketing system. I was in charge of making sure all the PC/Laptop images were working and updated using Symantec ghost solution suite and on schedule to be shipped to each of our remote locations. I routinely troubleshot Lotus Notes, Blackberry problems, network connectivity outages and all hardware/software related issues. I helped train any new PC Technicians that started with the company. Additionally, I possessed network administration rights and routinely used active directory to maintain policies, grant access using GPO’s, delete/create users, mass deploy approved software, and transfer user data when necessary. Hardware supported and used: IBM Laptops, HP Desktops, Canon/HP printers, and blackberries. Software supported and used: Lotus notes 7.0.5, HEAT, Microsoft office 2003, Microsoft XP, Symantec Ghost Solution Suite 2.0, Symantec Anti-Virus V.10, Citrix 9.0, and Cisco VPN."
good,I enjoyed my time under contract with Lennar and left on cordial terms when my contract came to an end.  The environment was excellent and i was always provided the software and hardware I requested that was required to fulfill my deliverables.
good,Overall a good place to work. It was good to help customers complete their new home. I gained extensive knowledge about presenting a new home and how to work with families finish to complete it.
good,"As a New Home Consultant your responsibilities are to help facilitate realistic expectations during the selection, building process. Also you are a liaison between the Customer and the Company. Insuring the the best result for both."
good,"walk homes, schedule trades, walking with inspectors"
good,This place had all types of folks working there with quirks and all so there was bound to be someone you could befriend. It was a close knit group that management nurtured with the company outings and events they held for the associates. They were quick to volunteer to help communities around where their offices were located at. It was always a time to celebrate someones good fortune or to help someone go through a rough patch. They made it like family for such a large national company.
good,"Worked there during college over a summer. There was a lot of downtime, but often too much of it. Felt like a waste of a day to go in and do as little work as was often accomplished. For those looking for such a job it is not bad, but I wanted something more fulfilling. Lots of interaction with families, sometimes crazy ones that resent anyone repremanding their misbehaving children."
good,"My typical day involves testing of IT Controls, meeting with various levels of IT management, learn of new processes and initiatives.  Working with staff auditors and consultants.  Planning my approach to upcoming audits and travel engagements."
good,"Provided 1st year warranty to new homeowners. Inspected homes and set up appointments with contractors to do any repairs. Half the day was in the field the other half was entering and ordering parts. I enjoyed working and meeting the homeowners, they grow to trust you and appreciate all that you do. Very rewarding"
good,Great company to work. Leadership is supportive of new ideas and encourages team work. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the employees improve their skills.
good,Ran productive field jobs a with a wonderful team of people.
good,"Overall, I loved Lennar and the people I worked with! Lennar offered good compensation for the New Home Consultants and excellent benefits and co-workers were quality people with great work ethic. I would consider working here again."
good,"Loved working there , but the pay wasn’t there. Wish it was more . The management was great and the corporate office was good also . I would definitely go back if the pay goes up ."
good,"Normal job site activities. Paperwork, team meeting, foreman's meeting, morning job site walk, visual QC all buildings under construction. Schedule updates if needed. More paper work."
good,The company is trying to grow in size and profitability so they are putting a lot on their employees to succeed so they can become more of a household name. They want you to succeed but it is difficult due to you having to take on so many tasks throughout the day. Construction managers have to take on a lot of stress due to them having to deal with the trade workers and customers/homeowners. It is a lot to take on for a day to day basis. Sometimes you are unable to get done what you need because you need to solve something else out for the customer or trade worker.
good,"Warranty superintendent position is great, fun, challenging, rewarding. Really miss working for them but due to market downturn in 08 they shut down in Illinois. "
good,"This place is an amazing place to work for. From the people, to the culture, you can't go wrong working here for this company. If you have a chance, do it."
good,"Like all home builders, Lennar was a fast paced work environment.  There was always a rush to get homes completed so they could be put on the market.  But they would also have some fun days.  Whole division would go to Six Flags or construction guys would have a day of golfing."
good,"Working with Sub Contractors from the Floor plans to the closing of the home. Taking requests for permits and changes to the Building department.  Working with the Home Owners on a punch list so our company could deliver a zero defect product.  I learned how to multi-task and work with multi-ethnic groups. I was trained to understand different parts of the trade as a construction Superintendent.  Direct oversight for each home under construction.  Walk through's after each phase of the home was completed before Inspector was scheduled."
good,Pay is not on par with other companies in the industry.                                                                                                     .
good,"Field work with flexible hours, working with many different people"
good,This work is very stressful every day is a new challenge and to add to the stress you are moved around a lot to many different places. its a fun job but on the other hand very tedious. I don't recommend applying without construction experience of some kind for a couple years.
good,"Heavy calendar management, processing invoices, reviewing contracts. Answering busy phone. Co- workers were supportive, Nice life and work balance."
good,"A typical day at work… Set up appointments and meet face to face with homeowners, talk about their warranty claims.  Schedule and oversee warrantable claims."
good,"Strong Management  especially my DOS. The bottom line was important on a daily basis. Although I had my own community and wasn't competing with anyone directly, it was competitive. Work was life and compensation could have been a little better."
good,"The Northern VA team at Lennar was ran very well, had a great management team, and allowed their superintendent to work freely and forge relationships with the subcontractors. I had a great time there, and would work for them again if the opportunity presented itself"
good,High quality home builder suffered from the recession more than most other companies.
good,I was an integral part of a major migration in 2018. We converted all 34 divisions from Oracle (CRM On Demand) to Salesforce Lightning. I was laid off with 72 people at the end of 2019. I am ready to help any other company out there that needs me.
good,"Fairly a good place to work at, good use of technology in most cases. "
good,"decent pay and benefits, not a very stressful job/environment generally very laid back and flexible schedules and ability to work from home on occasion"
good,Very productive and very rich with experience in residential building. Great work culture and very reasonable in their expectations of new comers................................
good,It’s a pretty good atmosphere for team oriented individuals. Rather loose on exact hours of work as long as jobs are completed. Pay is decent but a topic that could always be better.
good,"Work Life Balance rather than typical Employer"
good,"Organized each clients tasks, collected and entered necessary daily paperwork into our system for clients to process towards their closing day. Communicated with loan processors,  Loan officers, and Realtors to keep files in order towards closing for clients."
good,"You may not use all of your skill set here but they will work you and compensate you very well. It's a very diverse environment and there are a plethora of positions. Parking may be an issue, but there are a lot of onsite amenities to keep you from having to leave for lunch."
good,Large project well managed provided the opportunity to improve the companies application. The team collaborates and makes the best resources available for the success of the project.
good,"Submitted purchase orders, take offs, and bid proposals for new construction. Created the profiles for new builds in our database to ensure home starts/billing/materials were accurate."
good,"I enjoyed working with company, the employees and staff are all like family, a teaching company with room to grow, and everyone stick together and help each other, if needed."
good,"All office personnel and managers, including the President, were extremely easy to work for and with. I would go back there in a minute if I still lived there."
good,"Senior leadership of the company truly cares about the employees. The work ethic may be hardcore for some, but it comes naturally as you want to be part of the success of this company. If I wasn't moving halfway across the country, I would have stayed for the long haul. Even with the move (for family reasons) everyone bent over backwards to try and find a position within reasonable proximity to where I was moving. It didn't work out, but I certainly appreciate the effort and wish the company well. Great benefits. Good pay. Good career advancement opportunities."
good,"Strived to make a fun yet productive work environment and the did just. that. I looked forward to going to work everyday, accepting the challenges and working to the end result"
good,I thought this was a hard first job for me but leaned a lot about people and how to have a good ethic at work. I thought that while I learned a lot there was a political stuff going on at the time which was hard to hear.
good,"I would over see the in tier builds from start to finish. Dealing with many different personalities, I learned how to prepare a home for the home owners with out no more than after move in touch ups. Management could use some improvements. Most co workers where great and others no so much. The hardest part of the job was going home. The most enjoyable part of the job was the various different people I met on a day to day basis."
good,Great place to work.  Challenging with high expectations.  You get compensated by working harder.  They expect a lot from you but you are rewarded for it.
good,Very strong local team that worked together well. Corporate was very aggressive and calculating. Very innovative risk takers.
good,"Great opportunities offered at this company during my employment."
good,"Lennar Homes, FL was a great place to work at the height of the real estate market in SFL.  I learned a lot in my time there"
good,"I learned how to properly communicate information more concisely to multiple levels of management. Being the key intermediary requires you to be the ""go to person"" that knows exactly what is going on in the projects. Any relevant changes./updates need to be addressed accordingly to the appropriate parties. The most enjoyable part of the job was the fact that the workload always carried me the whole day. Start the day at work and next things its lunch, and then wrapping it up for the day."
good,I loved working for this company in everyway. The people I worked with were caring and helpful throughout my employment with LNR. I have a lot of wonderful memories. They changed owners several time in the last few years and it was hard to know what their mission was for the future. I hear that the companies if doing great and wish the company a great future.
good,"My work day was split about 50/50 with new business and ongoing business.  Half of my time was dedicated to identifying new properties suitable for residential development and home building.  The other half was spent managing the acquisition process from contract negotiations to due diligence and market studies.  Ultimately, each deal was summarized in an investment package to be sent to regional and national executives for approval.  Upon approval, there were additional processes for closing.  Working at Lennar allowed me to learn the land acquisition process which is similar for most national home builders.  Our team was top notch including management.  Work hours could be long and unpredictable, but vacation and standard time off was always respected."
good,"Wonderful benefits with nice co-workers. A typical day is Monday-Friday from 9-5:30. Management varies by department. Some are motivating, and some are not. The most enjoyable part of my job is talking to different people around the country."
good,Good place to build a career in sales. Very helpful and concerned with moving up and forward. Training is good. They are very appreciative of their hard working people.
good,"Lennar was not your typical employer, as I quickly discovered while working there as a temp. (prior to being hired permanently). They were very culture oriented and subscribed to the 'work hard , play hard ' philosophy.  "
good,I learned quite a bit about what goes into building a house from the bottom up. I got to help with a habitat home. I was always meeting new suppliers with was great. They company is very much into volunteering and gave us the opportunity throughout the year.

good,"I enjoyed working with the employee's and management."
good,Great place to work with great benefits. Most enjoyable was coworkers. Hardest part of job was end of the quarter and end of the year because there were deadlines.
good,Fun work place with supportive management. Great place to state a career. I would recommend this company in the future.
good,"Worked with people planning a new home"
good,"The BEST company I ever worked for.  The CEO was a brilliant and generous man when it came to the employees. My typical day involved working in the sales office, greeting visitors, demonstrating models, showing available properties, submitting offers to the seller, reviewing options with construction manager.  I loved this job. It was the dream job.  The hardest part was working on the weekends and not being able to attend family functions but the payoff was great so I would never complain.  I got along very well with my co-workers and we all encouraged each other to be successful."
good,good place to work as long as the housing market is good if its not no job security
good,I enjoyed my time working for the company. I developed good friendship with people I worked with. The most enjoyable part was actually getting up and wanting to go to work.

good,"Lennar provides a wonderful product and a terrific opportunity to make a lot of money.  There are no typical days so the unpredictability adds excitement to the job.  The most difficult thing in this job is staying focused and productive when business is slow.  When there are plenty of customers it is energizing.  When you make a sale and see customer excitement, it is very gratifying."
good,"Lennar is serious about reporting and performance driven."
good,Corporate and regional management are very approachable and helpful. Their managers worked in the field and understand the business and the challenges of your position. HR really cares and were always helpful.
good,The most difficult part of the job was dealing with the finished product from the construction side and the fun part was being able to start from scratch and put my personal touch on my team.
good,Everyday is different from the prior day. You always have over 20 work orders to complete. All employees try to help one another to finish all apartment problems that arise for that particular day.
good,"Very successful run with Lennar communities in Northern Virginia  and Williamsburg. Built single and multi family communities, as well as commercial condominiums in Northern Virginia and single and multi family homes in Williamsburg community. Work hard and high reward environment.

good,Great company with great leadership.  I only left for an opportunity to move up the chain and further my career.  The Division Manager is fantastic along with the Regional Manager.

good,I loved my job and surrounding s there.  The expected you to work hard and compensated you for it.  Great place to work.  I would work there again given the chance.

good,Local management really changed hands to many times and with that new management wanted to implement there ways not the companies culutre.

good,A typical day at work would consist of doing one or more parts of a lawn in a timely manner. I learned to pay attention to smaller details. Management helped a little with the work itself and rewarded me when needed. The hardest part was constantly moving in the heat and having to bend over numerous times.

good,"Lennar has a great workplace culture and a strong dedication to volunteer in the community through their ""Focused Acts of Caring"" program, which I loved. The office I worked for was a satellite office rather than a main Division office branch, so there was plenty of opportunity to learn a lot about different administrative aspects of the homebuilding field.There is a strong sense of teamwork that I really appreciated and I would highly recommend Lennar as an employer."
good,"Great place to work!  Supportive environment and team work.  Enjoyed team environment, but was allowed to work independently.  Great company benefits."

good,"I worked between 2003 and 2007 I was laid off during the market crash. I was the best job I have ever had! I worked hard, learned so much and enjoyed the company of my co-workers.
